<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Sixteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous asherself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough byletter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!</p><p>Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, withoutreproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied therewas a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in herstyle, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.&mdash; Itmight be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel onlycould have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.</p><p>She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and shewas fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, withoutresorting to invention.&mdash;There was a tooth amiss. Harriet reallywished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. JohnKnightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was arecommendation to her&mdash;and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr.Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.&mdash;When itwas thus settled on her sister's side, Emma proposed it to her friend,and found her very persuadable.&mdash; Harriet was to go; she was invitedfor at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse'scarriage.&mdash;It was all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet wassafe in Brunswick Square.</p><p>Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she couldtalk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that senseof injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had hauntedher when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how muchmight at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by thefeelings which she had led astray herself.</p><p>The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, madeperhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she couldnot think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.</p><p>She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to theplace in her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communicationbefore her, one which <i>she</i> only could be competent to make&mdash; theconfession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothingto do with it at present.&mdash;She had resolved to defer the disclosuretill Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should bethrown at this period among those she loved&mdash; and the evil should notact on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.&mdash;A fortnight,at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but moreagitating, delight, should be hers.</p><p>She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ halfan hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.&mdash; Sheought to go&mdash;and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of theirpresent situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It wouldbe a <i>secret</i> satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarityof prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she shouldattend to any thing Jane might communicate.</p><p>She went&mdash;she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but hadnot been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poorJane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.&mdash; The fearof being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their beingat home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.&mdash; She heardPatty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bateshad before made so happily intelligible.&mdash;No; she heard nothing but theinstant reply of, "Beg her to walk up;"&mdash;and a moment afterwards shewas met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if noother reception of her were felt sufficient.&mdash; Emma had never seen herlook so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness,animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance ormanner could ever have wanted.&mdash; She came forward with an offered hand;and said, in a low, but very feeling tone,</p><p>"This is most kind, indeed!&mdash;Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for meto express&mdash;I hope you will believe&mdash;Excuse me for being so entirelywithout words."</p><p>Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, ifthe sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checkedher, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all hercongratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.</p><p>Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, whichaccounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with everybody; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hopedthe rencontre would do them no harm.</p><p>She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, andunderstand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being inMiss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with whatwas still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediatelyin the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments toMrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, shesaw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter whichshe had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return itinto the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significantnods,</p><p>"We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall notwant opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essentialalready. I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology,and is not offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is asweet creature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.&mdash;But not aword more. Let us be discreet&mdash; quite on our goodbehaviour.&mdash;Hush!&mdash;You remember those lines&mdash; I forget the poem at thismoment:</p><pre>       "For when a lady's in the case,<br />       "You know all other things give place."<br /></pre><p>Now I say, my dear, in <i>our</i> case, for <i>lady</i>, read&mdash;&mdash;mum! a word to the wise.&mdash;I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.&mdash;<i>My</i> representation, you see, has quite appeased her."</p><p>And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,</p><p>"I mentioned no <i>names</i>, you will observe.&mdash;Oh! no; cautious as a minister of state. I managed it extremely well."</p><p>Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on everypossible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmonyof the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressedwith,</p><p>"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here ischarmingly recovered?&mdash;Do not you think her cure does Perry the highestcredit?&mdash;(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon myword, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!&mdash; Oh! if youhad seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!"&mdash; And when Mrs.Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther, "We do not say aword of any <i>assistance</i> that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.&mdash;Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit."</p><p>"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse," sheshortly afterwards began, "since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasantparty. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did notseem&mdash;that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits ofsome.&mdash;So it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However,I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say youboth to our collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again,while the fine weather lasts?&mdash; It must be the same party, you know,quite the same party, not <i>one</i> exception."</p><p>Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help beingdiverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to sayevery thing.</p><p>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.&mdash;It isimpossible to say&mdash;Yes, indeed, I quite understand&mdash;dearest Jane'sprospects&mdash; that is, I do not mean.&mdash;But she is charmingly recovered.&mdash;How is Mr. Woodhouse?&mdash;I am so glad.&mdash;Quite out of my power.&mdash; Such ahappy little circle as you find us here.&mdash;Yes, indeed.&mdash; Charming youngman!&mdash;that is&mdash;so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!&mdash; suchattention to Jane!"&mdash;And from her great, her more than commonlythankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed thatthere had been a little show of resentment towards Jane, from thevicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.&mdash; After a fewwhispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speakinglouder, said,</p><p>"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, thatanywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truthis, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join mehere, and pay his respects to you."</p><p>"What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?&mdash; Thatwill be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morningvisits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged."</p><p>"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.&mdash;He really is engaged from morningto night.&mdash;There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretenceor other.&mdash;The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, arealways wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing withouthim.&mdash;`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than I.&mdash; I donot know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I hadhalf so many applicants.'&mdash;Bad enough as it is, for I absolutelyneglect them both to an unpardonable degree.&mdash;I believe I have notplayed a bar this fortnight.&mdash;However, he is coming, I assure you: yes,indeed, on purpose to wait on you all." And putting up her hand toscreen her words from Emma&mdash;"A congratulatory visit, you know.&mdash;Oh!yes, quite indispensable."</p><p>Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!&mdash;</p><p>"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himselffrom Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deepconsultation.&mdash;Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand."</p><p>Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, "Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?&mdash;He will have a hot walk."</p><p>"Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston andCole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those wholead.&mdash;I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way."</p><p>"Have not you mistaken the day?" said Emma. "I am almost certainthat the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.&mdash;Mr. Knightley wasat Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday."</p><p>"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day," was the abrupt answer,which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.&mdash;"I do believe," she continued, "this is the most troublesome parishthat ever was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove."</p><p>"Your parish there was small," said Jane.</p><p>"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject talked of."</p><p>"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heardyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children."</p><p>"Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking brainyou have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make,if we could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity wouldproduce perfection.&mdash;Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that <i>some</i> people may not think <i>you</i> perfection already.&mdash;But hush!&mdash; not a word, if you please."</p><p>It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give herwords, not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainlysaw. The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, wasvery evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.</p><p>Mr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity.</p><p>"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be anencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!&mdash; Butyou knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew Ishould not stir till my lord and master appeared.&mdash; Here have I beensitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugalobedience&mdash;for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?"</p><p>Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrownaway. His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but hissubsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he wassuffering, and the walk he had had for nothing.</p><p>"When I got to Donwell," said he, "Knightley could not be found.Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home tillone."</p><p>"Donwell!" cried his wife.&mdash;"My dear Mr. E., you have not been toDonwell!&mdash;You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown."</p><p>"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to seeKnightley to-day on that very account.&mdash;Such a dreadful broilingmorning!&mdash; I went over the fields too&mdash;(speaking in a tone of greatill-usage,) which made it so much the worse. And then not to find himat home! I assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, nomessage for me. The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my beingexpected.&mdash; Very extraordinary!&mdash;And nobody knew at all which way hewas gone. Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps intohis woods.&mdash; Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friendKnightley!&mdash;Can you explain it?"</p><p>Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary, indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.</p><p>"I cannot imagine," said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as awife ought to do,) "I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing byyou, of all people in the world! The very last person whom one shouldexpect to be forgotten!&mdash;My dear Mr. E., he must have left a messagefor you, I am sure he must.&mdash;Not even Knightley could be so veryeccentric;&mdash; and his servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was thecase: and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.&mdash;I am sure I wouldnot have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for anyconsideration. And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheapindeed.&mdash;She promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it."</p><p>"I met William Larkins," continued Mr. Elton, "as I got near thehouse, and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I didnot believe him.&mdash;William seemed rather out of humour. He did not knowwhat was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly everget the speech of him. I have nothing to do with William's wants, butit really is of very great importance that <i>I</i> should seeKnightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very seriousinconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose."</p><p>Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In allprobability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towardsMr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.</p><p>She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined toattend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave heran opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,</p><p>"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Hadyou not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted tointroduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than mighthave been strictly correct.&mdash;I feel that I should certainly have beenimpertinent."</p><p>"Oh!" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thoughtinfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usualcomposure&mdash;"there would have been no danger. The danger would have beenof my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than byexpressing an interest&mdash;. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking morecollectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, verygreat misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that thoseof my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are notdisgusted to such a degree as to&mdash;I have not time for half that I couldwish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something formyself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately&mdash;in short, if yourcompassion does not stand my friend&mdash;"</p><p>"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are," cried Emma warmly, andtaking her hand. "You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom youmight be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delightedeven&mdash;"</p><p>"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.&mdash; Socold and artificial!&mdash;I had always a part to act.&mdash;It was a life ofdeceit!&mdash;I know that I must have disgusted you."</p><p>"Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on myside. Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to bedone quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hopeyou have pleasant accounts from Windsor?"</p><p>"Very."</p><p>"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you&mdash; just as I begin to know you."</p><p>"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."</p><p>"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps," replied Emma, smiling&mdash;"but, excuse me, it must be thought of."</p><p>The smile was returned as Jane answered,</p><p>"You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you,(I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr.Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, atleast, of deep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there willbe nothing more to wait for."</p><p>"Thank you, thank you.&mdash;This is just what I wanted to be assuredof.&mdash; Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided andopen!&mdash; Good-bye, good-bye."</p></body>
