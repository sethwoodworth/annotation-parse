<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Eleven</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma'spower to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The comingof her sister's family was so very near at hand, that first inanticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her primeobject of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfieldit was not to be expected&mdash;she did not herself expect&mdash; that any thingbeyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her tothe lovers. They might advance rapidly if they would, however; theymust advance somehow or other whether they would or no. She hardlywished to have more leisure for them. There are people, who the moreyou do for them, the less they will do for themselves.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usualabsent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usualinterest. Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage hadbeen divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidaysof this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and itwas therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way bytheir Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could notbe induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; andwho consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy inforestalling this too short visit.</p><p>He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not alittle of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bringsome of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms wereneedless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. andMrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number ofnursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy ofsuch an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, andvariously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusionwhich his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor haveendured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and thefeelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, thatin spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of herlittle ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty andattendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, thechildren were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either inthemselves or in any restless attendance on them.</p><p>Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and sotenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higherties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see afault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding orany quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inheritedalso much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health,over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves,and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could beof Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper,and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.</p><p>Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his privatecharacter; but with reserved manners which prevented his beinggenerally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. Hewas not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as todeserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection;and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible thatany natural defects in it should not be increased. The extremesweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness andquickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act anungracious, or say a severe thing.</p><p>He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothingwrong in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuriesto Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might havepassed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister,but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, withoutpraise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personalcompliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of allin her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectfulforbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patiencethat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities andfidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance orsharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr.John Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, andgenerally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too oftenfor Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain ofapprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. Thebeginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properestfeelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to passaway in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated andcomposed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and asigh, called his daughter's attention to the sad change at Hartfieldsince she had been there last.</p><p>"Ah, my dear," said he, "poor Miss Taylor&mdash;It is a grievous business."</p><p>"Oh yes, sir," cried she with ready sympathy, "how you must missher! And dear Emma, too!&mdash;What a dreadful loss to you both!&mdash; I havebeen so grieved for you.&mdash;I could not imagine how you could possibly dowithout her.&mdash;It is a sad change indeed.&mdash;But I hope she is prettywell, sir."</p><p>"Pretty well, my dear&mdash;I hope&mdash;pretty well.&mdash;I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably."</p><p>Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls.</p><p>"Oh! no&mdash;none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in mylife&mdash; never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret."</p><p>"Very much to the honour of both," was the handsome reply.</p><p>"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?" asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.&mdash;"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish."</p><p>"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since theymarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,either at Randalls or here&mdash;and as you may suppose, Isabella, mostfrequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Westonis really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholyway, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every bodymust be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body oughtalso to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent ourmissing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated&mdash;whichis the exact truth."</p><p>"Just as it should be," said Mr. John Knightley, "and just as Ihoped it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention couldnot be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it alleasy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea ofthe change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; andnow you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied."</p><p>"Why, to be sure," said Mr. Woodhouse&mdash;"yes, certainly&mdash;I cannotdeny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us prettyoften&mdash; but then&mdash;she is always obliged to go away again."</p><p>"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.&mdash; You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."</p><p>"I think, indeed," said John Knightley pleasantly, "that Mr. Westonhas some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the partof the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, theclaims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As forIsabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience ofputting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can."</p><p>"Me, my love," cried his wife, hearing and understanding only inpart.&mdash; "Are you talking about me?&mdash;I am sure nobody ought to be, orcan be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had notbeen for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never havethought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I thinkthere is nothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the verybest-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and yourbrother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget hisflying Henry's kite for him that very windy day last Easter&mdash;and eversince his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writingthat note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me thatthere was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there couldnot be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.&mdash;If any bodycan deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor."</p><p>"Where is the young man?" said John Knightley. "Has he been here on this occasion&mdash;or has he not?"</p><p>"He has not been here yet," replied Emma. "There was a strongexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended innothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."</p><p>"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear," said her father."He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a veryproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it verywell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, onecannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps&mdash;"</p><p>"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes."</p><p>"Three-and-twenty!&mdash;is he indeed?&mdash;Well, I could not have thoughtit&mdash; and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well,time does fly indeed!&mdash;and my memory is very bad. However, it was anexceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a greatdeal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and datedSept. 28th&mdash;and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on;and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'&mdash; I remember thatperfectly."</p><p>"How very pleasing and proper of him!" cried the good-hearted Mrs.John Knightley. "I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man.But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from hisparents and natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston couldpart with him. To give up one's child! I really never could think wellof any body who proposed such a thing to any body else."</p><p>"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy," observedMr. John Knightley coolly. "But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to havefelt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston israther an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehowor other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called societyfor his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, andplaying whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon familyaffection, or any thing that home affords."</p><p>Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, andhad half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. Shewould keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourableand valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of hometo himself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down onthe common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it wasimportant.&mdash;It had a high claim to forbearance.</p></body>
