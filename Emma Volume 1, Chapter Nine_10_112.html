<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Nine</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" />Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel withherself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usualbefore he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his gravelooks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could notrepent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and morejustified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the nextfew days.</p><p>The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the commonsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his halfsentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet'sfeelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong andsteady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma wassoon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered,than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantageto the latter.</p><p>Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal ofuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a fewfirst chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was mucheasier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imaginationrange and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlargeher comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literarypursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision shewas making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribingall the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thinquarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented withciphers and trophies.</p><p>In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scaleare not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, hadwritten out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken thefirst hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get agreat many more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste;and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be anarrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as thegirls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their puttingin. "So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young&mdash;hewondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time."And it always ended in "Kitty, a fair but frozen maid."</p><p>His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he haddesired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,something, he thought, might come from that quarter.</p><p>It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects ofHighbury in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was theonly one whose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute anyreally good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect;and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with hisrecollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, mostearnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathea compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to him theirtwo or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which atlast he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-knowncharade,</p><pre>   My first doth affliction denote,<br />     Which my second is destin'd to feel<br />   And my whole is the best antidote<br />     That affliction to soften and heal.&mdash;<br /></pre><p>made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already.</p><p>"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?" said she;"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could beeasier to you."</p><p>"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind inhis life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even MissWoodhouse"&mdash;he stopt a moment&mdash;"or Miss Smith could inspire him."</p><p>The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. Hecalled for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the tablecontaining, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressedto a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from hismanner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.</p><p>"I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection," said he. "Being myfriend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it."</p><p>The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma couldunderstand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found iteasier to meet her eye than her friend's. He was gone the nextmoment:&mdash;after another moment's pause,</p><p>"Take it," said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards Harriet&mdash;"it is for you. Take your own."</p><p>But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.</p><pre>       To Miss&mdash;<br /></pre><pre>         CHARADE.<br /></pre><pre>   My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,<br />     Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.<br />   Another view of man, my second brings,<br />     Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!<br /></pre><pre>   But ah! united, what reverse we have!<br />     Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;<br />   Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,<br />     And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br /></pre><pre>     Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,<br />     May its approval beam in that soft eye!<br /></pre><p>She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read itthrough again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, andthen passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hopeand dulness, "Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worsecharades. <i>Courtship</i>&mdash;a very good hint. I give you credit forit. This is feeling your way. This is saying very plainly&mdash;`Pray, MissSmith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade andmy intentions in the same glance.'</p><pre>     May its approval beam in that soft eye!<br /></pre><p>Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye&mdash;of all epithets, the justest that could be given.</p><pre>     Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.<br /></pre><p>Humph&mdash;Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very muchin love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you hadthe benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in yourlife you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellentcharade indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to acrisis soon now.</p><p>She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by theeagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.</p><p>"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?&mdash;what can it be? I have not anidea&mdash;I cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do tryto find it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing sohard. Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was&mdash;and who could be theyoung lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?</p><pre>     And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br /></pre><p>Can it be Neptune?</p><pre>     Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!<br /></pre><p>Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only onesyllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?"</p><p>"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are youthinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade madeby a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.</p><p>For Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, read Miss Smith.</p><pre>   My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,<br />     Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.<br /></pre><p>That is <i>court</i>.</p><pre>   Another view of man, my second brings;<br />     Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!<br /></pre><p>That is <i>ship</i>;&mdash;plain as it can be.&mdash;Now for the cream.</p><pre>   But ah! united, (<i>courtship</i>, you know,) what reverse we have!<br />     Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.<br />   Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,<br />     And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br /></pre><p>A very proper compliment!&mdash;and then follows the application, which Ithink, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty incomprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt ofits being written for you and to you."</p><p>Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She readthe concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could notspeak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.Emma spoke for her.</p><p>"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in thiscompliment," said she, "that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton'sintentions. You are his object&mdash;and you will soon receive thecompletest proof of it. I thought it must be so. I thought I could notbe so deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clearand decided, as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knewyou. Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the verycircumstance to happen what has happened. I could never tell whether anattachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or mostnatural. Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalledeach other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, withall my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pridein creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. It willgive you every thing that you want&mdash;consideration, independence, aproper home&mdash;it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends,close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This,Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us."</p><p>"Dear Miss Woodhouse!"&mdash;and "Dear Miss Woodhouse," was all thatHarriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but whenthey did arrive at something more like conversation, it wassufficiently clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, andremembered just as she ought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very ampleacknowledgment.</p><p>"Whatever you say is always right," cried Harriet, "and therefore Isuppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could nothave imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about <i>him</i>.He is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses&mdash;`To Miss&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.' Dear me, how clever!&mdash;Could it really be meant for me?"</p><p>"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It isa certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to theplay, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed bymatter-of-fact prose."</p><p>"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure,a month ago, I had no more idea myself!&mdash;The strangest things do takeplace!"</p><p>"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted&mdash;they do indeed&mdash;andreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is soevidently, so palpably desirable&mdash;what courts the pre-arrangement ofother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to oneanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marryingwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be asomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the rightdirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.</p><pre>     The course of true love never did run smooth&mdash;<br /></pre><p>A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage."</p><p>"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,&mdash;me, of allpeople, who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looksup to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, thatevery body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does notchuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week.And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts hehas ever preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I lookback to the first time I saw him! How little did I think!&mdash;The twoAbbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind whenwe heard he was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, andstaid to look through herself; however, she called me back presently,and let me look too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful wethought he looked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole."</p><p>"This is an alliance which, whoever&mdash;whatever your friends may be,must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense;and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they areanxious to see you <i>happily</i> married, here is a man whose amiablecharacter gives every assurance of it;&mdash;if they wish to have yousettled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to placeyou in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only object is thatyou should, in the common phrase, be <i>well</i> married, here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy them."</p><p>"Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. Youunderstand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as theother. This charade!&mdash;If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could neverhave made any thing like it."</p><p>"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it yesterday."</p><p>"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read."</p><p>"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly."</p><p>"It is as long again as almost all we have had before."</p><p>"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things in general cannot be too short."</p><p>Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind.</p><p>"It is one thing," said she, presently&mdash;her cheeks in a glow&mdash;"tohave very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and ifthere is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say justwhat you must, in a short way; and another, to write verses andcharades like this."</p><p>Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's prose.</p><p>"Such sweet lines!" continued Harriet&mdash;"these two last!&mdash;But howshall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found itout?&mdash;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?"</p><p>"Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, Idare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or otherwill pass between us, and you shall not be committed.&mdash;Your soft eyesshall chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me."</p><p>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write thisbeautiful charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half sogood."</p><p>"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book."</p><p>"Oh! but those two lines are"&mdash;</p><p>&mdash;"The best of all. Granted;&mdash;for private enjoyment; and for privateenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does itsmeaning change. But take it away, and all <i>appropriation</i> ceases,and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection.Depend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, muchbetter than his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in bothcapacities, or neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, andthen there can be no possible reflection on you."</p><p>Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down adeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degreeof publicity.</p><p>"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands," said she.</p><p>"Very well," replied Emma; "a most natural feeling; and the longerit lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming:you will not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be givinghim so much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especiallyany thing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit ofgallantry towards us all!&mdash;You must let me read it to him."</p><p>Harriet looked grave.</p><p>"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon thischarade.&mdash;You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are tooconscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or evenquite all the meaning which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpoweredby such a little tribute of admiration. If he had been anxious forsecrecy, he would not have left the paper while I was by; but he ratherpushed it towards me than towards you. Do not let us be too solemn onthe business. He has encouragement enough to proceed, without oursighing out our souls over this charade."</p><p>"Oh! no&mdash;I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please."</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, bythe recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of "Well, my dears, howdoes your book go on?&mdash;Have you got any thing fresh?"</p><p>"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. Apiece of paper was found on the table this morning&mdash;(dropt, we suppose,by a fairy)&mdash;containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copiedit in."</p><p>She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowlyand distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of everypart as she proceeded&mdash;and he was very much pleased, and, as she hadforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.</p><p>"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Verytrue. `Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, thatI can easily guess what fairy brought it.&mdash;Nobody could have written soprettily, but you, Emma."</p><p>Emma only nodded, and smiled.&mdash;After a little thinking, and a very tender sigh, he added,</p><p>"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear motherwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I canremember nothing;&mdash;not even that particular riddle which you have heardme mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there areseveral.</p><pre>   Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,<br />     Kindled a flame I yet deplore,<br />   The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,<br />   Though of his near approach afraid,<br />     So fatal to my suit before.<br /></pre><p>And that is all that I can recollect of it&mdash;but it is very cleverall the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it."</p><p>"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know."</p><p>"Aye, very true.&mdash;I wish I could recollect more of it.</p><pre>   Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.<br /></pre><p>The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very nearbeing christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall haveher here next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall puther&mdash;and what room there will be for the children?"</p><p>"Oh! yes&mdash;she will have her own room, of course; the room she alwayshas;&mdash;and there is the nursery for the children,&mdash;just as usual, youknow. Why should there be any change?"</p><p>"I do not know, my dear&mdash;but it is so long since she was here!&mdash;notsince last Easter, and then only for a few days.&mdash;Mr. John Knightley'sbeing a lawyer is very inconvenient.&mdash;Poor Isabella!&mdash;she is sadlytaken away from us all!&mdash;and how sorry she will be when she comes, notto see Miss Taylor here!"</p><p>"She will not be surprized, papa, at least."</p><p>"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married."</p><p>"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is here."</p><p>"Yes, my dear, if there is time.&mdash;But&mdash;(in a very depressedtone)&mdash;she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for anything."</p><p>"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer&mdash;but it seems a caseof necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, andwe ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of thetime they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to betaken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claimthis Christmas&mdash;though you know it is longer since they were with him,than with us."</p><p>"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield."</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on hisbrother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He satmusing a little while, and then said,</p><p>"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back sosoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her tostay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well."</p><p>"Ah! papa&mdash;that is what you never have been able to accomplish, andI do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind herhusband."</p><p>This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr.Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw hisspirits affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to herhusband, she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as mustraise them.</p><p>"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while mybrother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with thechildren. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonderwhich she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?"</p><p>"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they willbe to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet."</p><p>"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not."</p><p>"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is theeldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, thatthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which Ithought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. Theyare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They willcome and stand by my chair, and say, `Grandpapa, can you give me a bitof string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him kniveswere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough withthem very often."</p><p>"He appears rough to you," said Emma, "because you are so verygentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, youwould not think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy;and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but heis an affectionate father&mdash;certainly Mr. John Knightley is anaffectionate father. The children are all fond of him."</p><p>"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way!"</p><p>"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It issuch enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the ruleof their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to theother."</p><p>"Well, I cannot understand it."</p><p>"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other."</p><p>Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separatein preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of thisinimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma couldreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned inhis the consciousness of having made a push&mdash;of having thrown a die;and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. Hisostensible reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's partycould be made up in the evening without him, or whether he should be inthe smallest degree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thingelse must give way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying somuch about his dining with him&mdash;had made such a point of it, that hehad promised him conditionally to come.</p><p>Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing hisfriend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. Here-urged&mdash;she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow,when taking the paper from the table, she returned it&mdash;</p><p>"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I haveventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will nottake it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the firsteight lines."</p><p>Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He lookedrather doubtingly&mdash;rather confused; said something about"honour,"&mdash;glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the bookopen on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. Withthe view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,</p><p>"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charademust not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman'sapprobation while he writes with such gallantry."</p><p>"I have no hesitation in saying," replied Mr. Elton, thoughhesitating a good deal while he spoke; "I have no hesitation insaying&mdash;at least if my friend feels at all as <i>I</i> do&mdash;I have not the smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as <i>I</i> see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life."</p><p>After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could notthink it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, therewas a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline herto laugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tenderand the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.</p></body>
