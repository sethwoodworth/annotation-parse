<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Five</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before herfriend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led her tothe very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to <i>The</i> <i>Rev.</i> <i>Philip</i> <i>Elton</i>, <i>White-Hart</i>, <i>Bath</i>,was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher'scart, which was to convey it to where the coaches past; and every thingin this world, excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequentlya blank.</p><p>She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to beput down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led betweenespalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing whichhad given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning torevive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observedher to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, whichdetermined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter ofan hour. She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an oldservant who was married, and settled in Donwell.</p><p>The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gateagain; and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her withoutdelay, and unattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarilydown the gravel walk&mdash;a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, andparting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility.</p><p>Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She wasfeeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough tounderstand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received herdoubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplacehad been talked almost all the time&mdash; till just at last, when Mrs.Martin's saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith wasgrown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner.In that very room she had been measured last September, with her twofriends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscotby the window. <i>He</i> had done it. They all seemed to remember theday, the hour, the party, the occasion&mdash;to feel the same consciousness,the same regrets&mdash;to be ready to return to the same good understanding;and they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emmamust suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,)when the carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit,and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteenminutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed sixweeks not six months ago!&mdash;Emma could not but picture it all, and feelhow justly they might resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It wasa bad business. She would have given a great deal, or endured a greatdeal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life. They were sodeserving, that a <i>little</i> higher should have been enough: but asit was, how could she have done otherwise?&mdash;Impossible!&mdash;She could notrepent. They must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain inthe process&mdash; so much to herself at this time, that she soon felt thenecessity of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way ofRandalls to procure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and theMartins. The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.</p><p>It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard thatneither "master nor mistress was at home;" they had both been out sometime; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.</p><p>"This is too bad," cried Emma, as they turned away. "And now weshall just miss them; too provoking!&mdash;I do not know when I have been sodisappointed." And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge hermurmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both&mdash; such beingthe commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently thecarriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, whowere standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sightof them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound&mdash;for Mr.Weston immediately accosted her with,</p><p>"How d'ye do?&mdash;how d'ye do?&mdash;We have been sitting with your father&mdash;glad to see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow&mdash;I had a letter thismorning&mdash;we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty&mdash; he is atOxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would beso. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; Iwas always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to havejust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shallenjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we couldwish."</p><p>There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding theinfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all wasby the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, butnot less to the purpose. To know that <i>she</i> thought his comingcertain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did sherejoice in their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhaustedspirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what wascoming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr.Elton would now be talked of no more.</p><p>Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at hiscommand, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and shelistened, and smiled, and congratulated.</p><p>"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield," said he, at the conclusion.</p><p>Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his wife.</p><p>"We had better move on, Mr. Weston," said she, "we are detaining the girls."</p><p>"Well, well, I am ready;"&mdash;and turning again to Emma, "but you must not be expecting such a <i>very</i> fine young man; you have only had <i>my</i>account you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:"&mdash;though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a verydifferent conviction.</p><p>Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing.</p><p>"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock," was Mrs.Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant onlyfor her.</p><p>"Four o'clock!&mdash;depend upon it he will be here by three," was Mr.Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore adifferent air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish asbefore. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at leastmust soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she sawsomething like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.</p><p>"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?"&mdash; was a question, however, which did not augur much.</p><p>But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, andEmma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.</p><p>The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston'sfaithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelveo'clock, that she was to think of her at four.</p><p>"My dear, dear anxious friend,"&mdash;said she, in mental soliloquy,while walking downstairs from her own room, "always overcareful forevery body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your littlefidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure that all isright." The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. "'Tistwelve; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and bythis time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking ofthe possibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bringhim soon."</p><p>She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with herfather&mdash;Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a fewminutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation ofFrank's being a day before his time, and her father was yet in themidst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared,to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.</p><p>The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, wasactually before her&mdash;he was presented to her, and she did not think toomuch had been said in his praise; he was a <i>very</i> good lookingyoung man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and hiscountenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of hisfather's; he looked quick and sensible. She felt immediately that sheshould like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and areadiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to beacquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.</p><p>He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with theeagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travelearlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.</p><p>"I told you yesterday," cried Mr. Weston with exultation, "I toldyou all that he would be here before the time named. I remembered whatI used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot helpgetting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming inupon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great dealmore than any little exertion it needs."</p><p>"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it," said the youngman, "though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;but in coming <i>home</i> I felt I might do any thing."</p><p>The word <i>home</i> made his father look on him with freshcomplacency. Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himselfagreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed. He wasvery much pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arrangedhouse, would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired thesituation, the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more,and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in thecountry which none but one's <i>own</i> country gives, and thegreatest curiosity to visit it. That he should never have been able toindulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously through Emma'sbrain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, andpleasantly handled. His manner had no air of study or exaggeration. Hedid really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment.</p><p>Their subjects in general were such as belong to an openingacquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,&mdash;"Was she ahorsewoman?&mdash;Pleasant rides?&mdash; Pleasant walks?&mdash;Had they a largeneighbourhood?&mdash;Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?&mdash;There wereseveral very pretty houses in and about it.&mdash;Balls&mdash;had theyballs?&mdash;Was it a musical society?"</p><p>But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintanceproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, whiletheir two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing hismother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, somuch warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she securedto his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was anadditional proof of his knowing how to please&mdash; and of his certainlythinking it worth while to try to please her. He did not advance a wordof praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs.Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. Heunderstood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. "Hisfather's marriage," he said, "had been the wisest measure, every friendmust rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such ablessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highestobligation on him."</p><p>He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things itwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse'scharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as ifresolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to itsobject, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty ofher person.</p><p>"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for," said he; "but Iconfess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than avery tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know thatI was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston."</p><p>"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings," said Emma; "were you to guess her to be <i>eighteen</i>, I should listen with pleasure; but <i>she</i>would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words. Don't let herimagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman."</p><p>"I hope I should know better," he replied; "no, depend upon it,(with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I shouldunderstand whom I might praise without any danger of being thoughtextravagant in my terms."</p><p>Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expectedfrom their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of hermind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to beconsidered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She mustsee more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt theywere agreeable.</p><p>She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. Hisquick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with ahappy expression; and even, when he might have determined not to look,she was confident that he was often listening.</p><p>Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, theentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther fromapproving matrimony than from foreseeing it.&mdash; Though always objectingto every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand fromthe apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill ofany two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry tillit were proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. Hecould now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, withouta glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way toall his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evilsof sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixedanxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold&mdash;which,however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself tillafter another night.</p><p>A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.&mdash;"He must begoing. He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great manyerrands for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any bodyelse." His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,saying,</p><p>"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take theopportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other,and therefore may as well be paid now. I have the honour of beingacquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a ladyresiding in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shallhave no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, Ibelieve, is not the proper name&mdash;I should rather say Barnes, or Bates.Do you know any family of that name?"</p><p>"To be sure we do," cried his father; "Mrs. Bates&mdash;we passed herhouse&mdash; I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquaintedwith Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girlshe is. Call upon her, by all means."</p><p>"There is no necessity for my calling this morning," said the youngman; "another day would do as well; but there was that degree ofacquaintance at Weymouth which&mdash;"</p><p>"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be donecannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;any want of attention to her <i>here</i> should be carefully avoided.You saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every bodyshe mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who hasbarely enough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight."</p><p>The son looked convinced.</p><p>"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance," said Emma; "she is a very elegant young woman."</p><p>He agreed to it, but with so quiet a "Yes," as inclined her almostto doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinctsort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could bethought only ordinarily gifted with it.</p><p>"If you were never particularly struck by her manners before," saidshe, "I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see herand hear her&mdash;no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she hasan aunt who never holds her tongue."</p><p>"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?" said Mr.Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; "then giveme leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable younglady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, veryworthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremelyglad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you toshew you the way."</p><p>"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me."</p><p>"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great manyhouses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where youhad best cross the street."</p><p>Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as hecould, and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, "My goodfriend, this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water whenhe sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown ina hop, step, and jump."</p><p>They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one,and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emmaremained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, andcould now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day,with full confidence in their comfort.</p></body>
