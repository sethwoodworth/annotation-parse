<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Twelve</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ballcompletely satisfactory to Emma&mdash;its being fixed for a day within thegranted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr.Weston's confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that theChurchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond hisfortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must taketheir time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week wereentered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding andhoping in uncertainty&mdash;at the risk&mdash; in her opinion, the great risk, ofits being all in vain.</p><p>Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. Hiswish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was notopposed. All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of onesolicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain ofher ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provokingindifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, orbecause the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he seemedresolved that it should not interest him, determined against itsexciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,than,</p><p>"Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all thistrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to sayagainst it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.&mdash; Oh! yes,I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as Ican; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins'sweek's account; much rather, I confess.&mdash; Pleasure in seeingdancing!&mdash;not I, indeed&mdash;I never look at it&mdash; I do not know whodoes.&mdash;Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something verydifferent."</p><p>This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It wasnot in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent,or so indignant; he was not guided by <i>her</i> feelings in reprobating the ball, for <i>she</i> enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It made her animated&mdash;open hearted&mdash; she voluntarily said;&mdash;</p><p>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with<i>very</i> great pleasure."</p><p>It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would havepreferred the society of William Larkins. No!&mdash;she was more and moreconvinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. Therewas a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on hisside&mdash;but no love.</p><p>Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley.Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throwof every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge hisnephew's instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell&mdash; far too unwell todo without him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said herhusband) when writing to her nephew two days before, though from herusual unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinkingof herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill totrifle, and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.</p><p>The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note fromMrs. Weston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must begone within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for hisaunt, to lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they neveroccurred but for her own convenience.</p><p>Mrs. Weston added, "that he could only allow himself time to hurryto Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends therewhom he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might beexpected at Hartfield very soon."</p><p>This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once ithad been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim.The loss of the ball&mdash;the loss of the young man&mdash; and all that theyoung man might be feeling!&mdash;It was too wretched!&mdash; Such a delightfulevening as it would have been!&mdash;Every body so happy! and she and herpartner the happiest!&mdash;"I said it would be so," was the onlyconsolation.</p><p>Her father's feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally ofMrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; andas for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; butthey would all be safer at home.</p><p>Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but ifthis reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and totalwant of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the goingaway almost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. Hesat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousinghimself, it was only to say,</p><p>"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst."</p><p>"But you will come again," said Emma. "This will not be your only visit to Randalls."</p><p>"Ah!&mdash;(shaking his head)&mdash;the uncertainty of when I may be able toreturn!&mdash;I shall try for it with a zeal!&mdash;It will be the object of allmy thoughts and cares!&mdash;and if my uncle and aunt go to town thisspring&mdash;but I am afraid&mdash;they did not stir last spring&mdash; I am afraid itis a custom gone for ever."</p><p>"Our poor ball must be quite given up."</p><p>"Ah! that ball!&mdash;why did we wait for any thing?&mdash;why not seize thepleasure at once?&mdash;How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,foolish preparation!&mdash;You told us it would be so.&mdash;Oh! Miss Woodhouse,why are you always so right?"</p><p>"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much rather have been merry than wise."</p><p>"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends on it. Do not forget your engagement."</p><p>Emma looked graciously.</p><p>"Such a fortnight as it has been!" he continued; "every day moreprecious and more delightful than the day before!&mdash;every day making meless fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain atHighbury!"</p><p>"As you do us such ample justice now," said Emma, laughing, "I willventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sureyou did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long incoming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury."</p><p>He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma was convinced that it had been so.</p><p>"And you must be off this very morning?"</p><p>"Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, andI must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment willbring him."</p><p>"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax andMiss Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mindmight have strengthened yours."</p><p>"Yes&mdash;I <i>have</i> called there; passing the door, I thought itbetter. It was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, andwas detained by Miss Bates's being absent. She was out; and I felt itimpossible not to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may,that one <i>must</i> laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my visit, then"&mdash;</p><p>He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.</p><p>"In short," said he, "perhaps, Miss Woodhouse&mdash;I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion"&mdash;</p><p>He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardlyknew what to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutelyserious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore,in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,</p><p>"You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then"&mdash;</p><p>He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probablyreflecting on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner.She heard him sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had <i>cause</i>to sigh. He could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkwardmoments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined mannersaid,</p><p>"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm"&mdash;</p><p>He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.&mdash; He wasmore in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how itmight have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr.Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made himcomposed.</p><p>A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable ofprocrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any thatwas doubtful, said, "It was time to go;" and the young man, though hemight and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.</p><p>"I shall hear about you all," said he; "that is my chiefconsolation. I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. Ihave engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind asto promise it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one isreally interested in the absent!&mdash;she will tell me every thing. In herletters I shall be at dear Highbury again."</p><p>A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest "Good-bye," closedthe speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short hadbeen the notice&mdash;short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt sosorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society fromhis absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling ittoo much.</p><p>It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day sincehis arrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit tothe last two weeks&mdash;indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation ofseeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of hisattentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happyfortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the commoncourse of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, hehad <i>almost</i> told her that he loved her. What strength, or whatconstancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; butat present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration,a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to allthe rest, made her think that she <i>must</i> be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous determination against it.</p><p>"I certainly must," said she. "This sensation of listlessness,weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employmyself, this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about thehouse!&mdash; I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in theworld if I were not&mdash;for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some isalways good to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball,if not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He mayspend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes."</p><p>Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could notsay that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look wouldhave contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, thathe was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and withconsiderable kindness added,</p><p>"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!"</p><p>It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honestregret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure wasodious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering fromheadache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the balltaken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it wascharity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor ofill-health.</p></body>
