<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Six</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a properdirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very goodpurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of hisadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident ofcreating as much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be anyoccasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in thefairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had noscruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her sowarmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a littletime would not add. His perception of the striking improvement ofHarriet's manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one ofthe least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.</p><p>"You have given Miss Smith all that she required," said he; "youhave made her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when shecame to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added areinfinitely superior to what she received from nature."</p><p>"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet onlywanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had allthe natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. Ihave done very little."</p><p>"If it were admissible to contradict a lady," said the gallant Mr. Elton&mdash;</p><p>"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, havetaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before."</p><p>"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!"</p><p>"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition more truly amiable."</p><p>"I have no doubt of it." And it was spoken with a sort of sighinganimation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleasedanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,to have Harriet's picture.</p><p>"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?" said she: "did you ever sit for your picture?"</p><p>Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say, with a very interesting naivete,</p><p>"Oh! dear, no, never."</p><p>No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,</p><p>"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! Iwould give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likenessmyself. You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I hada great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of myfriends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But fromone cause or another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I couldalmost venture, if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delightto have her picture!"</p><p>"Let me entreat you," cried Mr. Elton; "it would indeed be adelight! Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming atalent in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. Howcould you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens ofyour landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitablefigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?"</p><p>Yes, good man!&mdash;thought Emma&mdash;but what has all that to do withtaking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be inraptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. "Well, ifyou give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall trywhat I can do. Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes alikeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of theeye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch."</p><p>"Exactly so&mdash;The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth&mdash;Ihave not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will doit, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession."</p><p>"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. Shethinks so little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner ofanswering me? How completely it meant, `why should my picture bedrawn?'"</p><p>"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded."</p><p>Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediatelymade; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes againstthe earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to workdirectly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her variousattempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, thatthey might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her manybeginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She hadalways wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both indrawing and music than many might have done with so little labour asshe would ever submit to. She played and sang;&mdash;and drew in almostevery style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing hadshe approached the degree of excellence which she would have been gladto command, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceivedas to her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was notunwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation foraccomplishment often higher than it deserved.</p><p>There was merit in every drawing&mdash;in the least finished, perhaps themost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or hadthere been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her twocompanions would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. Alikeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must becapital.</p><p>"No great variety of faces for you," said Emma. "I had only my ownfamily to study from. There is my father&mdash;another of my father&mdash;but theidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could onlytake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Westonagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always mykindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegantfigure!&mdash;and the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness ofher, if she would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to haveme draw her four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here comeall my attempts at three of those four children;&mdash;there they are, Henryand John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any oneof them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have themdrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of threeor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to takeany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they arecoarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is mysketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping onthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you wouldwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That'svery like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofais very good. Then here is my last,"&mdash;unclosing a pretty sketch of agentleman in small size, whole-length&mdash;"my last and my best&mdash;mybrother, Mr. John Knightley.&mdash;This did not want much of being finished,when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take anotherlikeness. I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, andwhen I had really made a very good likeness of it&mdash;(Mrs. Weston and Iwere quite agreed in thinking it <i>very</i> like)&mdash;only toohandsome&mdash;too flattering&mdash;but that was a fault on the right side&mdash;afterall this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of&mdash;"Yes, it was alittle like&mdash;but to be sure it did not do him justice." We had had agreat deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all. It was made agreat favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and so Inever would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourablelikeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;&mdash;and, as Isaid, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again. But forHarriet's sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands andwives in the case <i>at</i> <i>present</i>, I will break my resolution now."</p><p>Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, andwas repeating, "No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, asyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives," with so interesting aconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not betterleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, thedeclaration must wait a little longer.</p><p>She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be awhole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and wasdestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourablestation over the mantelpiece.</p><p>The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid ofnot keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweetmixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. Butthere was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her andwatching every touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself wherehe might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged toput an end to it, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It thenoccurred to her to employ him in reading.</p><p>"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindnessindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessenthe irksomeness of Miss Smith's."</p><p>Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew inpeace. She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; anything less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he wasready at the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and seethe progress, and be charmed.&mdash;There was no being displeased with suchan encourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almostbefore it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love andhis complaisance were unexceptionable.</p><p>The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enoughpleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no wantof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meantto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little moreheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of itsbeing in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling itsdestined place with credit to them both&mdash;a standing memorial of thebeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; withas many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promisingattachment was likely to add.</p><p>Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as heought, entreated for the permission of attending and reading to themagain.</p><p>"By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party."</p><p>The same civilities and courtesies, the same success andsatisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the wholeprogress of the picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who sawit was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defendedit through every criticism.</p><p>"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty shewanted,"&mdash;observed Mrs. Weston to him&mdash;not in the least suspecting thatshe was addressing a lover.&mdash;"The expression of the eye is mostcorrect, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is thefault of her face that she has them not."</p><p>"Do you think so?" replied he. "I cannot agree with you. It appearsto me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such alikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know."</p><p>"You have made her too tall, Emma," said Mr. Knightley.</p><p>Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,</p><p>"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider,she is sitting down&mdash;which naturally presents a different&mdash;which inshort gives exactly the idea&mdash;and the proportions must be preserved,you know. Proportions, fore-shortening.&mdash;Oh no! it gives one exactlythe idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!"</p><p>"It is very pretty," said Mr. Woodhouse. "So prettily done! Just asyour drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws sowell as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that sheseems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over hershoulders&mdash;and it makes one think she must catch cold."</p><p>"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer. Look at the tree."</p><p>"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear."</p><p>"You, sir, may say any thing," cried Mr. Elton, "but I must confessthat I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith outof doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Anyother situation would have been much less in character. The naivete ofMiss Smith's manners&mdash;and altogether&mdash;Oh, it is most admirable! Icannot keep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness."</p><p>The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were afew difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London;the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whosetaste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of allcommissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr.Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house inthe fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr.Elton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert."Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure shouldhe have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It wasimpossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed onsuch an errand."</p><p>"He was too good!&mdash;she could not endure the thought!&mdash;she would notgive him such a troublesome office for the world,"&mdash;brought on thedesired repetition of entreaties and assurances,&mdash;and a very fewminutes settled the business.</p><p>Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, andgive the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensureits safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearfulof not being incommoded enough.</p><p>"What a precious deposit!" said he with a tender sigh, as he received it.</p><p>"This man is almost too gallant to be in love," thought Emma. "Ishould say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different waysof being in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harrietexactly; it will be an `Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he doessigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I couldendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.But it is his gratitude on Harriet's account."</p></body>
