<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Thirteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>The weather continued much the same all the following morning; andthe same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign atHartfield&mdash;but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into asofter quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it wassummer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives,Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had theexquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, andbrilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed forthe serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's comingin soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, shelost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery.&mdash;There, with spiritsfreshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns,when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and comingtowards her.&mdash;It was the first intimation of his being returned fromLondon. She had been thinking of him the moment before, asunquestionably sixteen miles distant.&mdash;There was time only for thequickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and calm. In half aminute they were together. The "How d'ye do's" were quiet andconstrained on each side. She asked after their mutual friends; theywere all well.&mdash;When had he left them?&mdash;Only that morning. He must havehad a wet ride.&mdash;Yes.&mdash;He meant to walk with her, she found. "He hadjust looked into the dining-room, and as he was not wanted there,preferred being out of doors."&mdash;She thought he neither looked nor spokecheerfully; and the first possible cause for it, suggested by herfears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to hisbrother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.</p><p>They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was oftenlooking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suitedher to give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wantedto speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching forencouragement to begin.&mdash;She did not, could not, feel equal to lead theway to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could notbear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. Sheconsidered&mdash;resolved&mdash;and, trying to smile, began&mdash;</p><p>"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather surprize you."</p><p>"Have I?" said he quietly, and looking at her; "of what nature?"</p><p>"Oh! the best nature in the world&mdash;a wedding."</p><p>After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he replied,</p><p>"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that already."</p><p>"How is it possible?" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towardshim; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have calledat Mrs. Goddard's in his way.</p><p>"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning,and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened."</p><p>Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more composure,</p><p>"<i>You</i> probably have been less surprized than any of us, foryou have had your suspicions.&mdash;I have not forgotten that you once triedto give me a caution.&mdash;I wish I had attended to it&mdash;but&mdash;(with asinking voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed toblindness."</p><p>For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious ofhaving excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawnwithin his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying,in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,</p><p>"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.&mdash;Your ownexcellent sense&mdash;your exertions for your father's sake&mdash;I know you willnot allow yourself&mdash;." Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in amore broken and subdued accent, "The feelings of the warmestfriendship&mdash;Indignation&mdash;Abominable scoundrel!"&mdash; And in a louder,steadier tone, he concluded with, "He will soon be gone. They will soonbe in Yorkshire. I am sorry for <i>her</i>. She deserves a better fate."</p><p>Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from theflutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,</p><p>"You are very kind&mdash;but you are mistaken&mdash;and I must set youright.&mdash; I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness towhat was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always beashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many thingswhich may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have noother reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier."</p><p>"Emma!" cried he, looking eagerly at her, "are you, indeed?"&mdash; butchecking himself&mdash;"No, no, I understand you&mdash;forgive me&mdash;I am pleasedthat you can say even so much.&mdash;He is no object of regret, indeed! andit will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes theacknowledgment of more than your reason.&mdash;Fortunate that youraffections were not farther entangled!&mdash;I could never, I confess, fromyour manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt&mdash; I couldonly be certain that there was a preference&mdash;and a preference which Inever believed him to deserve.&mdash;He is a disgrace to the name ofman.&mdash;And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?&mdash; Jane,Jane, you will be a miserable creature."</p><p>"Mr. Knightley," said Emma, trying to be lively, but reallyconfused&mdash; "I am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let youcontinue in your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such animpression, I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that Inever have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as itmight be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly thereverse.&mdash; But I never have."</p><p>He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but hewould not. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled tohis clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lowerherself in his opinion. She went on, however.</p><p>"I have very little to say for my own conduct.&mdash;I was tempted by hisattentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.&mdash; An old story,probably&mdash;a common case&mdash;and no more than has happened to hundreds ofmy sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who setsup as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted thetemptation. He was the son of Mr. Weston&mdash;he was continually here&mdash;Ialways found him very pleasant&mdash;and, in short, for (with a sigh) let meswell out the causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this atlast&mdash;my vanity was flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly,however&mdash;for some time, indeed&mdash; I have had no idea of their meaningany thing.&mdash;I thought them a habit, a trick, nothing that called forseriousness on my side. He has imposed on me, but he has not injuredme. I have never been attached to him. And now I can tolerablycomprehend his behaviour. He never wished to attach me. It was merely ablind to conceal his real situation with another.&mdash;It was his object toblind all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectuallyblinded than myself&mdash;except that I was <i>not</i> blinded&mdash;that it was my good fortune&mdash;that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him."</p><p>She had hoped for an answer here&mdash;for a few words to say that herconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far asshe could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usualtone, he said,</p><p>"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.&mdash;I can suppose,however, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him hasbeen but trifling.&mdash;And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, hemay yet turn out well.&mdash;With such a woman he has a chance.&mdash;I have nomotive for wishing him ill&mdash;and for her sake, whose happiness will beinvolved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish himwell."</p><p>"I have no doubt of their being happy together," said Emma; "I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached."</p><p>"He is a most fortunate man!" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy."So early in life&mdash;at three-and-twenty&mdash;a period when, if a man chusesa wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn sucha prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, hasbefore him!&mdash;Assured of the love of such a woman&mdash;the disinterestedlove, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness;every thing in his favour,&mdash; equality of situation&mdash;I mean, as far asregards society, and all the habits and manners that are important;equality in every point but one&mdash; and that one, since the purity of herheart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for itwill be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.&mdash;A man wouldalways wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes herfrom; and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of <i>her</i>regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.&mdash;Frank Churchill is,indeed, the favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for hisgood.&mdash;He meets with a young woman at a watering-place, gains heraffection, cannot even weary her by negligent treatment&mdash;and had he andall his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him, theycould not have found her superior.&mdash;His aunt is in the way.&mdash;His auntdies.&mdash;He has only to speak.&mdash;His friends are eager to promote hishappiness.&mdash; He had used every body ill&mdash;and they are all delighted toforgive him.&mdash; He is a fortunate man indeed!"</p><p>"You speak as if you envied him."</p><p>"And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy."</p><p>Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence ofHarriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, ifpossible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totallydifferent&mdash;the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited forbreath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,</p><p>"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.&mdash;You are determined, I see, to have no curiosity.&mdash;You are wise&mdash;but <i>I</i> cannot be wise. Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the next moment."</p><p>"Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it," she eagerly cried. "Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself."</p><p>"Thank you," said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not another syllable followed.</p><p>Emma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide inher&mdash; perhaps to consult her;&mdash;cost her what it would, she wouldlisten. She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; shemight give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his ownindependence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must bemore intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.&mdash;They hadreached the house.</p><p>"You are going in, I suppose?" said he.</p><p>"No,"&mdash;replied Emma&mdash;quite confirmed by the depressed manner inwhich he still spoke&mdash;"I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry isnot gone." And, after proceeding a few steps, she added&mdash; "I stoppedyou ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave youpain.&mdash;But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, orto ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation&mdash;as afriend, indeed, you may command me.&mdash;I will hear whatever you like. Iwill tell you exactly what I think."</p><p>"As a friend!"&mdash;repeated Mr. Knightley.&mdash;"Emma, that I fear is aword&mdash;No, I have no wish&mdash;Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?&mdash; I havegone too far already for concealment.&mdash;Emma, I accept your offer&mdash;Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as afriend.&mdash;Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?"</p><p>He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression of his eyes overpowered her.</p><p>"My dearest Emma," said he, "for dearest you will always be,whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, mostbeloved Emma&mdash;tell me at once. Say `No,' if it is to be said."&mdash; Shecould really say nothing.&mdash;"You are silent," he cried, with greatanimation; "absolutely silent! at present I ask no more."</p><p>Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps themost prominent feeling.</p><p>"I cannot make speeches, Emma:" he soon resumed; and in a tone ofsuch sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerablyconvincing.&mdash;"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about itmore. But you know what I am.&mdash;You hear nothing but truth from me.&mdash;Ihave blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no otherwoman in England would have borne it.&mdash; Bear with the truths I wouldtell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. Themanner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, Ihave been a very indifferent lover.&mdash; But you understand me.&mdash;Yes, yousee, you understand my feelings&mdash; and will return them if you can. Atpresent, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice."</p><p>While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all thewonderful velocity of thought, had been able&mdash;and yet without losing aword&mdash; to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to seethat Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, adelusion, as complete a delusion as any of her own&mdash;that Harriet wasnothing; that she was every thing herself; that what she had beensaying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of herown feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, herdiscouragement, had been all received as discouragement fromherself.&mdash;And not only was there time for these convictions, with alltheir glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to rejoice thatHarriet's secret had not escaped her, and to resolve that it need not,and should not.&mdash;It was all the service she could now render her poorfriend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might haveprompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself toHarriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two&mdash; or even the moresimple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever,without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not marry them both,Emma had it not. She felt for Harriet, with pain and with contrition;but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that could beprobable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had led her friendastray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her judgmentwas as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever beenbefore, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal anddegrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.&mdash;She spoke then,on being so entreated.&mdash; What did she say?&mdash;Just what she ought, ofcourse. A lady always does.&mdash; She said enough to shew there need not bedespair&mdash;and to invite him to say more himself. He <i>had</i>despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to cautionand silence, as for the time crushed every hope;&mdash;she had begun byrefusing to hear him.&mdash;The change had perhaps been somewhatsudden;&mdash;her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing theconversation which she had just put an end to, might be a littleextraordinary!&mdash;She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was soobliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.</p><p>Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any humandisclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a littledisguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though theconduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be verymaterial.&mdash; Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relentingheart than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.</p><p>He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. Hehad followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He hadcome, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement,with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if sheallowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.&mdash;The rest had beenthe work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on hisfeelings. The delightful assurance of her total indifference towardsFrank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him,had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affectionhimself;&mdash;but it had been no present hope&mdash;he had only, in themomentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told thatshe did not forbid his attempt to attach her.&mdash;The superior hopes whichgradually opened were so much the more enchanting.&mdash; The affection,which he had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, wasalready his!&mdash;Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughlydistressed state of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, thatit could bear no other name.</p><p><i>Her</i> change was equal.&mdash;This one half-hour had given to eachthe same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each thesame degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.&mdash;On his side, therehad been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even theexpectation, of Frank Churchill.&mdash;He had been in love with Emma, andjealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentimenthaving probably enlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy ofFrank Churchill that had taken him from the country.&mdash;The Box Hillparty had decided him on going away. He would save himself fromwitnessing again such permitted, encouraged attentions.&mdash;He had gone tolearn to be indifferent.&mdash; But he had gone to a wrong place. There wastoo much domestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore tooamiable a form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma&mdash;differing onlyin those striking inferiorities, which always brought the other inbrilliancy before him, for much to have been done, even had his timebeen longer.&mdash;He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day afterday&mdash;till this very morning's post had conveyed the history of JaneFairfax.&mdash;Then, with the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he didnot scruple to feel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at alldeserving Emma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxietyfor her, that he could stay no longer. He had ridden home through therain; and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetestand best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, borethe discovery.</p><p>He had found her agitated and low.&mdash;Frank Churchill was a villain.&mdash;He heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill'scharacter was not desperate.&mdash;She was his own Emma, by hand and word,when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought ofFrank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort offellow.</p></body>
