<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Eleven</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances havebeen known of young people passing many, many months successively,without being at any ball of any description, and no material injuryaccrue either to body or mind;&mdash;but when a beginning is made&mdash; when thefelicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt&mdash;itmust be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.</p><p>Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to danceagain; and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse waspersuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the twoyoung people in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; andhis the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judgeof the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation andappearance. But still she had inclination enough for shewing peopleagain how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhousedanced&mdash;for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herselfwith Jane Fairfax&mdash;and even for simple dancing itself, without any ofthe wicked aids of vanity&mdash;to assist him first in pacing out the roomthey were in to see what it could be made to hold&mdash;and then in takingthe dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, inspite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size,that it was a little the largest.</p><p>His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr.Cole's should be finished there&mdash;that the same party should becollected, and the same musician engaged, met with the readiestacquiescence. Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment,and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they couldwish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed, ofreckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out theindispensable division of space to every couple.</p><p>"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the twoMiss Coxes five," had been repeated many times over. "And there will bethe two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr.Knightley. Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and MissSmith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five;and for five couple there will be plenty of room."</p><p>But soon it came to be on one side,</p><p>"But will there be good room for five couple?&mdash;I really do not think there will."</p><p>On another,</p><p>"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while tostand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.It will not do to <i>invite</i> five couple. It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment."</p><p>Somebody said that <i>Miss</i> Gilbert was expected at her brother's, and must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed <i>Mrs</i>.Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. Aword was put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston namingone family of cousins who must be included, and another of very oldacquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that thefive couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculationin what possible manner they could be disposed of.</p><p>The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. "Might notthey use both rooms, and dance across the passage?" It seemed the bestscheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted abetter. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distressabout the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the scoreof health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not bepersevered in.</p><p>"Oh! no," said he; "it would be the extreme of imprudence. I couldnot bear it for Emma!&mdash;Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadfulcold. So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, youwould be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Praydo not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is verythoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quitethe thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening, andkeeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of thedraught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is notquite the thing!"</p><p>Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance ofit, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was nowclosed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing onlyin the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will onFrank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hourbefore had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was nowendeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.</p><p>"We were too magnificent," said he. "We allowed unnecessary room. Ten couple may stand here very well."</p><p>Emma demurred. "It would be a crowd&mdash;a sad crowd; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in?"</p><p>"Very true," he gravely replied; "it was very bad." But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,</p><p>"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."</p><p>"No, no," said she, "you are quite unreasonable. It would bedreadful to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasurethan to be dancing in a crowd&mdash;and a crowd in a little room!"</p><p>"There is no denying it," he replied. "I agree with you exactly. Acrowd in a little room&mdash;Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of givingpictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!&mdash;Still, however,having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. Itwould be a disappointment to my father&mdash;and altogether&mdash;I do not knowthat&mdash;I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here verywell."</p><p>Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a littleself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure ofdancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.Had she intended ever to <i>marry</i> him, it might have been worthwhile to pause and consider, and try to understand the value of hispreference, and the character of his temper; but for all the purposesof their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.</p><p>Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and heentered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified thecontinuance of the scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce animprovement.</p><p>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," he almost immediately began, "yourinclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, bythe terrors of my father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal on thesubject:&mdash;a thought of my father's, which waits only your approbationto be acted upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the twofirst dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not atRandalls, but at the Crown Inn?"</p><p>"The Crown!"</p><p>"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust youcannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit himthere. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a lessgrateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston seesno objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we allfeel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of theRandalls rooms, would have been insufferable!&mdash;Dreadful!&mdash;I felt howright you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing <i>any</i> <i>thing</i> to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?&mdash;You consent&mdash; I hope you consent?"</p><p>"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer formyself, shall be most happy&mdash;It seems the only improvement that couldbe. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?"</p><p>She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fullycomprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations werenecessary to make it acceptable.</p><p>"No; he thought it very far from an improvement&mdash;a very bad plan&mdash;much worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp anddangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they mustdance, they had better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the roomat the Crown in his life&mdash;did not know the people who kept it bysight.&mdash;Oh! no&mdash;a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at theCrown than anywhere."</p><p>"I was going to observe, sir," said Frank Churchill, "that one ofthe great recommendations of this change would be the very littledanger of any body's catching cold&mdash; so much less danger at the Crownthan at Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration,but nobody else could."</p><p>"Sir," said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, "you are very muchmistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr.Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do notunderstand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than yourfather's house."</p><p>"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall haveno occasion to open the windows at all&mdash;not once the whole evening; andit is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold airupon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief."</p><p>"Open the windows!&mdash;but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think ofopening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I neverheard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!&mdash;I am sure, neitheryour father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would sufferit."</p><p>"Ah! sir&mdash;but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behinda window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. Ihave often known it done myself."</p><p>"Have you indeed, sir?&mdash;Bless me! I never could have supposed it.But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear.However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come totalk it over&mdash;but these sort of things require a good deal ofconsideration. One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs.Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk itover, and see what can be done."</p><p>"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited&mdash;"</p><p>"Oh!" interrupted Emma, "there will be plenty of time for talkingevery thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived tobe at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. Theywill be so near their own stable."</p><p>"So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James evercomplains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I couldbe sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired&mdash;but is Mrs. Stokes to betrusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight."</p><p>"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it willbe under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct thewhole."</p><p>"There, papa!&mdash;Now you must be satisfied&mdash;Our own dear Mrs. Weston,who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, somany years ago, when I had the measles? `If <i>Miss</i> <i>Taylor</i>undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' Howoften have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!"</p><p>"Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poorlittle Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you wouldhave been very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came four timesa day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very goodsort&mdash;which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadfulcomplaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have themeasles, she will send for Perry."</p><p>"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment," saidFrank Churchill, "examining the capabilities of the house. I left themthere and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hopingyou might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. Iwas desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure tothem, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothingsatisfactorily without you."</p><p>Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young peopleset off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy andvery happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; andhe, finding every thing perfect.</p><p>"Emma," said she, "this paper is worse than I expected. Look! inplaces you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellowand forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."</p><p>"My dear, you are too particular," said her husband. "What does allthat signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be asclean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on ourclub-nights."</p><p>The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, "Men neverknow when things are dirty or not;" and the gentlemen perhaps thoughteach to himself, "Women will have their little nonsenses and needlesscares."</p><p>One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.It regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built,suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, wasthe only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wantedas a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary bytheir four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortablesupper? Another room of much better size might be secured for thepurpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkwardpassage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; andneither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of beingmiserably crowded at supper.</p><p>Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,&amp;c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretchedsuggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, waspronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs.Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line ofexpediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,</p><p>"I do not think it <i>is</i> so very small. We shall not be many, you know."</p><p>And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out,</p><p>"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It isa mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs."</p><p>"I wish," said Mrs. Weston, "one could know which arrangement ourguests in general would like best. To do what would be most generallypleasing must be our object&mdash;if one could but tell what that would be."</p><p>"Yes, very true," cried Frank, "very true. You want your neighbours'opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chiefof them&mdash;the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I callupon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.&mdash; And I do not knowwhether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations ofthe rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a largercouncil. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?"</p><p>"Well&mdash;if you please," said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, "if you think she will be of any use."</p><p>"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates," said Emma."She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing.She will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage inconsulting Miss Bates."</p><p>"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond ofhearing Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, youknow."</p><p>Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it his decided approbation.</p><p>"Aye, do, Frank.&mdash;Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matterat once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know aproperer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch MissBates. We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson ofhow to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both."</p><p>"Both sir! Can the old lady?" . . .</p><p>"The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you agreat blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece."</p><p>"Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both."And away he ran.</p><p>Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-movingaunt, and her elegant niece,&mdash;Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered womanand a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils ofit much less than she had supposed before&mdash; indeed very trifling; andhere ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculationat least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table andchair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were leftas mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.Stokes.&mdash; Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had alreadywritten to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,which could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was tobe.</p><p>Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safercharacter,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general andminute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for anotherhalf-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the differentrooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment ofthe future. The party did not break up without Emma's being positivelysecured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, norwithout her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, "He has askedher, my dear. That's right. I knew he would!"</p></body>
