<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Four</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet cameone morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sittingdown and hesitating, thus began:</p><p>"Miss Woodhouse&mdash;if you are at leisure&mdash;I have something that Ishould like to tell you&mdash;a sort of confession to make&mdash;and then, youknow, it will be over."</p><p>Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was aseriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite as much asher words, for something more than ordinary.</p><p>"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish," she continued, "tohave no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite analtered creature in <i>one</i> <i>respect</i>, it is very fit that youshould have the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say morethan is necessary&mdash;I am too much ashamed of having given way as I havedone, and I dare say you understand me."</p><p>"Yes," said Emma, "I hope I do."</p><p>"How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . ." criedHarriet, warmly. "It seems like madness! I can see nothing at allextraordinary in him now.&mdash;I do not care whether I meet him ornot&mdash;except that of the two I had rather not see him&mdash; and indeed Iwould go any distance round to avoid him&mdash;but I do not envy his wife inthe least; I neither admire her nor envy her, as I have done: she isvery charming, I dare say, and all that, but I think her veryill-tempered and disagreeable&mdash;I shall never forget her look the othernight!&mdash;However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, I wish her no evil.&mdash;No,let them be ever so happy together, it will not give me anothermoment's pang: and to convince you that I have been speaking truth, Iam now going to destroy&mdash;what I ought to have destroyed long ago&mdash;whatI ought never to have kept&mdash; I know that very well (blushing as shespoke).&mdash;However, now I will destroy it all&mdash;and it is my particularwish to do it in your presence, that you may see how rational I amgrown. Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?" said she, with aconscious look.</p><p>"Not the least in the world.&mdash;Did he ever give you any thing?"</p><p>"No&mdash;I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued very much."</p><p>She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words <i>Most</i> <i>precious</i> <i>treasures</i>on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited. Harriet unfolded theparcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within abundance of silverpaper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet opened: itwas well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the cotton, Emmasaw only a small piece of court-plaister.</p><p>"Now," said Harriet, "you <i>must</i> recollect."</p><p>"No, indeed I do not."</p><p>"Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forgetwhat passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the verylast times we ever met in it!&mdash;It was but a very few days before I hadmy sore throat&mdash;just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came&mdash; I thinkthe very evening.&mdash;Do not you remember his cutting his finger with yournew penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?&mdash; But, as you hadnone about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so Itook mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large,and he cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left,before he gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could nothelp making a treasure of it&mdash; so I put it by never to be used, andlooked at it now and then as a great treat."</p><p>"My dearest Harriet!" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,and jumping up, "you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving thisrelic&mdash;I knew nothing of that till this moment&mdash;but the cutting thefinger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none aboutme!&mdash;Oh! my sins, my sins!&mdash;And I had plenty all the while in mypocket!&mdash;One of my senseless tricks!&mdash;I deserve to be under a continualblush all the rest of my life.&mdash;Well&mdash;(sitting down again)&mdash; goon&mdash;what else?"</p><p>"And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally."</p><p>"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for hissake!" said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feelingdivided between wonder and amusement. And secretly she added toherself, "Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting byin cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had beenpulling about! I never was equal to this."</p><p>"Here," resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, "here is something still more valuable, I mean that <i>has</i> <i>been</i> more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister never did."</p><p>Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an old pencil,&mdash;the part without any lead.</p><p>"This was really his," said Harriet.&mdash;"Do not you remember onemorning?&mdash;no, I dare say you do not. But one morning&mdash;I forget exactlythe day&mdash;but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before <i>that</i> <i>evening</i>,he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was aboutspruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewingspruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out hispencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and itwould not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the tableas good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared,caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment."</p><p>"I do remember it," cried Emma; "I perfectly remember it.&mdash; Talkingabout spruce-beer.&mdash;Oh! yes&mdash;Mr. Knightley and I both saying we likedit, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too. Iperfectly remember it.&mdash;Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, wasnot he? I have an idea he was standing just here."</p><p>"Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.&mdash;It is very odd, but Icannot recollect.&mdash;Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much aboutwhere I am now."&mdash;</p><p>"Well, go on."</p><p>"Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say&mdash; exceptthat I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish youto see me do it."</p><p>"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?"</p><p>"Yes, simpleton as I was!&mdash;but I am quite ashamed of it now, andwish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong ofme, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew itwas&mdash;but had not resolution enough to part with them."</p><p>"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?&mdash;I havenot a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaistermight be useful."</p><p>"I shall be happier to burn it," replied Harriet. "It has adisagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.&mdash; There itgoes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton."</p><p>"And when," thought Emma, "will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?"</p><p>She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning wasalready made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had <i>told</i>no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.&mdash;About a fortnightafter the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quiteundesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made theinformation she received more valuable. She merely said, in the courseof some trivial chat, "Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would adviseyou to do so and so"&mdash;and thought no more of it, till after a minute'ssilence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, "I shall nevermarry."</p><p>Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after amoment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,</p><p>"Never marry!&mdash;This is a new resolution."</p><p>"It is one that I shall never change, however."</p><p>After another short hesitation, "I hope it does not proceed from&mdash; I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?"</p><p>"Mr. Elton indeed!" cried Harriet indignantly.&mdash;"Oh! no"&mdash;and Emma could just catch the words, "so superior to Mr. Elton!"</p><p>She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed nofarther?&mdash;should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?&mdash;Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps ifshe were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her tohear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as hadbeen, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, shewas perfectly resolved.&mdash; She believed it would be wiser for her to sayand know at once, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing wasalways best. She had previously determined how far she would proceed,on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to havethe judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.&mdash; She wasdecided, and thus spoke&mdash;</p><p>"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Yourresolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results froman idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatlyyour superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?"</p><p>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption tosuppose&mdash; Indeed I am not so mad.&mdash;But it is a pleasure to me to admirehim at a distance&mdash;and to think of his infinite superiority to all therest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, whichare so proper, in me especially."</p><p>"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart."</p><p>"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!&mdash; The veryrecollection of it, and all that I felt at the time&mdash; when I saw himcoming&mdash;his noble look&mdash;and my wretchedness before. Such a change! Inone moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!"</p><p>"It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.&mdash; Yes,honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.&mdash; But that itwill be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise. I do notadvise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage forits being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will bewisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do notlet them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Beobservant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. Igive you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again onthe subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward Iknow nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We werevery wrong before; we will be cautious now.&mdash;He is your superior, nodoubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very seriousnature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, therehave been matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. Iwould not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assuredyour raising your thoughts to <i>him</i>, is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value."</p><p>Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma wasvery decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for herfriend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind&mdash; and itmust be saving her from the danger of degradation.</p></body>
