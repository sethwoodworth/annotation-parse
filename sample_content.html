<h3>SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.</h3><blockquote><i>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,  POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants</i></blockquote><a><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother''s death</a><br /><a>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</a><br /><a>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</a><br /><a>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</a><br /><a>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</a><br /><a>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</a><br /><a>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</a><br /><a>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</a><br /><a>The imperial jointress to this warlike state,</a><br /><a>Have we, as ''twere with a defeated joy,--</a><br /><a>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</a><br /><a>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</a><br /><a>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--</a><br /><a>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr''d</a><br /><a>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</a><br /><a>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</a><br /><a>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,</a><br /><a>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</a><br /><a>Or thinking by our late dear brother''s death</a><br /><a>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</a><br /><a>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</a><br /><a>He hath not fail''d to pester us with message,</a><br /><a>Importing the surrender of those lands</a><br /><a>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</a><br /><a>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</a><br /><a>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</a><br /><a>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</a><br /><a>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--</a><br /><a>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</a><br /><a>Of this his nephew''s purpose,--to suppress</a><br /><a>His further gait herein; in that the levies,</a><br /><a>The lists and full proportions, are all made</a><br /><a>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</a><br /><a>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,</a><br /><a>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;</a><br /><a>Giving to you no further personal power</a><br /><a>To business with the king, more than the scope</a><br /><a>Of these delated articles allow.</a><br /><a>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>CORNELIUS</b></a><a><b>VOLTIMAND</b></a><blockquote><a>In that and all things will we show our duty.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</a><br />\\r\\n<p><i>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</i></p>\\r\\n<a>And now, Laertes, what''s the news with you?</a><br /><a>You told us of some suit; what is''t, Laertes?</a><br /><a>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,</a><br /><a>And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</a><br /><a>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</a><br /><a>The head is not more native to the heart,</a><br /><a>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</a><br /><a>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</a><br /><a>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LAERTES</b></a><blockquote><a>My dread lord,</a><br /><a>Your leave and favour to return to France;</a><br /><a>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,</a><br /><a>To show my duty in your coronation,</a><br /><a>Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,</a><br /><a>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France</a><br /><a>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>Have you your father''s leave? What says Polonius?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave</a><br /><a>By laboursome petition, and at last</a><br /><a>Upon his will I seal''d my hard consent:</a><br /><a>I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</a><br /><a>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</a><br /><a>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HAMLET</b></a><blockquote><a>[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HAMLET</b></a><blockquote><a>Not so, my lord; I am too much i'' the sun.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b></a><blockquote><a>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,</a><br /><a>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</a><br /><a>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids</a><br /><a>Seek for thy noble father in the dust:</a><br /><a>Thou know''st ''tis common; all that lives must die,</a><br /><a>Passing through nature to eternity.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HAMLET</b></a><blockquote><a>Ay, madam, it is common.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b></a><blockquote><a>If it be,</a><br /><a>Why seems it so particular with thee?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HAMLET</b></a><blockquote><a>Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not ''seems.''</a><br /><a>''Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</a><br /><a>Nor customary suits of solemn black,</a><br /><a>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,</a><br /><a>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</a><br /><a>Nor the dejected ''havior of the visage,</a><br /><a>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</a><br /><a>That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,</a><br /><a>For they are actions that a man might play:</a><br /><a>But I have that within which passeth show;</a><br /><a>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>''Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</a><br /><a>To give these mourning duties to your father:</a><br /><a>But, you must know, your father lost a father;</a><br /><a>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</a><br /><a>In filial obligation for some term</a><br /><a>To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever</a><br /><a>In obstinate condolement is a course</a><br /><a>Of impious stubbornness; ''tis unmanly grief;</a><br /><a>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</a><br /><a>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</a><br /><a>An understanding simple and unschool''d:</a><br /><a>For what we know must be and is as common</a><br /><a>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</a><br /><a>Why should we in our peevish opposition</a><br /><a>Take it to heart? Fie! ''tis a fault to heaven,</a><br /><a>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</a><br /><a>To reason most absurd: whose common theme</a><br /><a>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</a><br /><a>From the first corse till he that died to-day,</a><br /><a>''This must be so.'' We pray you, throw to earth</a><br /><a>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</a><br /><a>As of a father: for let the world take note,</a><br /><a>You are the most immediate to our throne;</a><br /><a>And with no less nobility of love</a><br /><a>Than that which dearest father bears his son,</a><br /><a>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</a><br /><a>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</a><br /><a>It is most retrograde to our desire:</a><br /><a>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</a><br /><a>Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</a><br /><a>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b></a><blockquote><a>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:</a><br /><a>I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HAMLET</b></a><blockquote><a>I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a><blockquote><a>Why, ''tis a loving and a fair reply:</a><br /><a>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;</a><br /><a>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet</a><br /><a>Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,</a><br /><a>No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,</a><br /><a>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,</a><br /><a>And the king''s rouse the heavens all bruit again,</a><br /><a>Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.</a><br />\\r\\n<p><i>Exeunt all but HAMLET</i></p>\\r\\n</blockquote><a><b>HAMLET</b></a><blockquote><a>O, that this too too solid flesh would melt</a><br /><a>Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!</a><br /><a>Or that the Everlasting had not fix''d</a><br /><a>His canon ''gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!</a><br /><a>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,</a><br /><a>Seem to me all the uses of this world!</a><br /><a>Fie on''t! ah fie! ''tis an unweeded garden,</a><br /><a>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature</a><br /><a>Possess it merely. That it should come to this!</a><br /><a>But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:</a><br /><a>So excellent a king; that was, to this,</a><br /><a>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother</a><br /><a>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven</a><br /><a>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!</a><br /><a>Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,</a><br /><a>As if increase of appetite had grown</a><br /><a>By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--</a><br /><a>Let me not think on''t--Frailty, thy name is woman!--</a><br /><a>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</a><br /><a>With which she follow''d my poor father''s body,</a><br /><a>Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--</a><br /><a>O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,</a><br /><a>Would have mourn''d longer--married with my uncle,</a><br /><a>My father''s brother, but no more like my father</a><br /><a>Than I to Hercules: within a month:</a><br /><a>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</a><br /><a>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</a><br /><a>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post</a><br /><a>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!</a><br /><a>It is not nor it cannot come to good:</a><br /><a>But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.</a><br />\\r\\n<p><i>Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO</i></p>\\r\\n</blockquote><a><b>HORATIO</b></a><blockquote><a>Hail to your lordship!</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HAMLET</b></a><blockquote><a>I am glad to see you well:</a><br /><a>Horatio,--or I do forget myself.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HORATIO</b></a><blockquote><a>The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>HAMLET</b></a><blockquote><a>Sir, my good friend; I''ll change that name with you:</a><br /><a>And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
