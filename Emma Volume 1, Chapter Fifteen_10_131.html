<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Fifteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" />Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his teahe was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his threecompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness ofthe hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chattyand convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but atlast the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, invery good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston andEmma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.</p><p>Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind bythe expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his lateimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on hismaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with mostfriendly smiles.</p><p>He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend&mdash; herfair, lovely, amiable friend. "Did she know?&mdash;had she heard any thingabout her, since their being at Randalls?&mdash; he felt much anxiety&mdash;hemust confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed himconsiderably." And in this style he talked on for some time veryproperly, not much attending to any answer, but altogether sufficientlyawake to the terror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charitywith him.</p><p>But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once asif he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account,than on Harriet's&mdash;more anxious that she should escape the infection,than that there should be no infection in the complaint. He began withgreat earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting thesick-chamber again, for the present&mdash;to entreat her to <i>promise</i> <i>him</i>not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnthis opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subjectback into its proper course, there was no putting an end to his extremesolicitude about her. She was vexed. It did appear&mdash;there was noconcealing it&mdash;exactly like the pretence of being in love with her,instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible andabominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turnedto Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance, "Would not she give him hersupport?&mdash;would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce MissWoodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that MissSmith's disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without apromise&mdash; would not she give him her influence in procuring it?"</p><p>"So scrupulous for others," he continued, "and yet so careless forherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, andyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sorethroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?&mdash;Judge between us. Have notI some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid."</p><p>Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, atan address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself theright of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too muchprovoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing tothe purpose. She could only give him a look; but it was such a look asshe thought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa,removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.</p><p>She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidlydid another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into theroom from examining the weather, and opened on them all with theinformation of the ground being covered with snow, and of its stillsnowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these wordsto Mr. Woodhouse:</p><p>"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their waythrough a storm of snow."</p><p>Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every bodyelse had something to say; every body was either surprized or notsurprized, and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs.Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attentionfrom his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.</p><p>"I admired your resolution very much, sir," said he, "in venturingout in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow verysoon. Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired yourspirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour ortwo's snow can hardly make the road impassable; and we are twocarriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common fieldthere will be the other at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe atHartfield before midnight."</p><p>Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that hehad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest itshould make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for hishurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likelyto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraidthey would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmostgood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from theconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.</p><p>"What is to be done, my dear Emma?&mdash;what is to be done?" was Mr.Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, herrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and oftheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.</p><p>His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror ofbeing blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, wasfull in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passablefor adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she waseager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain atRandalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through allthe possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.</p><p>"You had better order the carriage directly, my love," said she; "Idare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and ifwe do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not atall afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change myshoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thingthat gives me cold."</p><p>"Indeed!" replied he. "Then, my dear Isabella, it is the mostextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thingdoes give you cold. Walk home!&mdash;you are prettily shod for walking home,I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses."</p><p>Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma couldnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who hadleft the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow,came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors toexamine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficultyin their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hourhence. He had gone beyond the sweep&mdash; some way along the Highburyroad&mdash;the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep&mdash;in many placeshardly enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling atpresent, but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance ofits being soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreedwith him in there being nothing to apprehend.</p><p>To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and theywere scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who wasimmediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervousconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not beappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued atRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger inreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safeto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus&mdash;</p><p>"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?"</p><p>"I am ready, if the others are."</p><p>"Shall I ring the bell?"</p><p>"Yes, do."</p><p>And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutesmore, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in hisown house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper andhappiness when this visit of hardship were over.</p><p>The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object onsuch occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley andMr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent somerenewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen,and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for."He was afraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poorIsabella would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in thecarriage behind. He did not know what they had best do. They must keepas much together as they could;" and James was talked to, and given acharge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.</p><p>Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting thathe did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife verynaturally; so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into thesecond carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut onthem, and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It would not havebeen the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked tohim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed butone. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he hadbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that hewould want to be talking nonsense.</p><p>To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she wasimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity ofthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely hadthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than shefound her subject cut up&mdash;her hand seized&mdash;her attention demanded, andMr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of theprecious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already wellknown, hoping&mdash;fearing&mdash;adoring&mdash;ready to die if she refused him; butflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love andunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. Itreally was so. Without scruple&mdash;without apology&mdash; without much apparentdiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself <i>her</i>lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say itall. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve torestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly mustbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only tothe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and theplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, shereplied,</p><p>"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to <i>me</i>! you forgetyourself&mdash; you take me for my friend&mdash;any message to Miss Smith I shallbe happy to deliver; but no more of this to <i>me</i>, if you please."</p><p>"Miss Smith!&mdash;message to Miss Smith!&mdash;What could she possiblymean!"&mdash; And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, suchboastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying withquickness,</p><p>"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I canaccount for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could notspeak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourselfenough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it."</p><p>But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, notat all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning;and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious,and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,&mdash;but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned atall,&mdash;he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgentfor a favourable answer.</p><p>As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of hisinconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,replied,</p><p>"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourselftoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I canexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the lastmonth, to Miss Smith&mdash;such attentions as I have been in the daily habitof observing&mdash;to be addressing me in this manner&mdash;this is anunsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the objectof such professions."</p><p>"Good Heaven!" cried Mr. Elton, "what can be the meaning of this?&mdash;Miss Smith!&mdash;I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of myexistence&mdash;never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: nevercared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she hasfancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am verysorry&mdash;extremely sorry&mdash;But, Miss Smith, indeed!&mdash;Oh! Miss Woodhouse!who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon myhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only ofyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any oneelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, hasbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannotreally, seriously, doubt it. No!&mdash;(in an accent meant to beinsinuating)&mdash;I am sure you have seen and understood me."</p><p>It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this&mdash;which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was toocompletely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two momentsof silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state ofmind, he tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed&mdash;</p><p>"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence. It confesses that you have long understood me."</p><p>"No, sir," cried Emma, "it confesses no such thing. So far fromhaving long understood you, I have been in a most complete error withrespect to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorrythat you should have been giving way to any feelings&mdash; Nothing could befarther from my wishes&mdash;your attachment to my friend Harriet&mdash;yourpursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and Ihave been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed thatshe were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly havethought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I tobelieve that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularlyto Miss Smith?&mdash;that you have never thought seriously of her?"</p><p>"Never, madam," cried he, affronted in his turn: "never, I assure you. <i>I</i>think seriously of Miss Smith!&mdash;Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl;and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish herextremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not objectto&mdash;Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equalalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!&mdash; No, madam, myvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragementI received&mdash;"</p><p>"Encouragement!&mdash;I give you encouragement!&mdash;Sir, you have beenentirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirerof my friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than acommon acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that themistake ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, MissSmith might have been led into a misconception of your views; not beingaware, probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequalitywhich you are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment issingle, and, I trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts ofmatrimony at present."</p><p>He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided toinvite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, andmutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a fewminutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to afoot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have beendesperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no roomfor the little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when thecarriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they foundthemselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and he was outbefore another syllable passed.&mdash;Emma then felt it indispensable towish him a good night. The compliment was just returned, coldly andproudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits, she was thenconveyed to Hartfield.</p><p>There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, whohad been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from VicarageLane&mdash;turning a corner which he could never bear to think of&mdash; and instrange hands&mdash;a mere common coachman&mdash;no James; and there it seemed asif her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness andattention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of herfather, as to seem&mdash;if not quite ready to join him in a basin ofgruel&mdash;perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and theday was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,except herself.&mdash;But her mind had never been in such perturbation; andit needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful tillthe usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.</p></body>
