<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Five</H2><p>"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston," said Mr.Knightley, "of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, butI think it a bad thing."</p><p>"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?&mdash;why so?"</p><p>"I think they will neither of them do the other any good."</p><p>"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying herwith a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. Ihave been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How verydifferently we feel!&mdash;Not think they will do each other any good! Thiswill certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.Knightley."</p><p>"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowingWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle."</p><p>"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for hethinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it onlyyesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that thereshould be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr.Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. Youare so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of acompanion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort awoman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used toit all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She isnot the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be. But onthe other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be aninducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. Shemeans it, I know."</p><p>"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve yearsold. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various timesof books that she meant to read regularly through&mdash;and very good liststhey were&mdash;very well chosen, and very neatly arranged&mdash;sometimesalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew upwhen only fourteen&mdash;I remember thinking it did her judgment so muchcredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have madeout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course ofsteady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiringindustry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to theunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safelyaffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.&mdash;You never could persuadeher to read half so much as you wished.&mdash;You know you could not."</p><p>"I dare say," replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "that I thought so <i>then</i>;&mdash;but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting to do any thing I wished."</p><p>"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as <i>that</i>,"&mdash;saidMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. "But I,"he soon added, "who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, muststill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverestof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being ableto answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She wasalways quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever sinceshe was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. Inher mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inheritsher mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her."</p><p>"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on <i>your</i>recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted anothersituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me toany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held."</p><p>"Yes," said he, smiling. "You are better placed <i>here</i>; veryfit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparingyourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers wouldseem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from <i>her</i>,on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, anddoing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him awife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor."</p><p>"Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston."</p><p>"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, andthat with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonnessof comfort, or his son may plague him."</p><p>"I hope not <i>that</i>.&mdash;It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not foretell vexation from that quarter."</p><p>"Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend toEmma's genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart,the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill infortune.&mdash;But Harriet Smith&mdash;I have not half done about Harriet Smith.I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possiblyhave. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing everything. She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emmaimagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presentingsuch a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture tosay that <i>she</i> cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield willonly put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to.She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those amongwhom birth and circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistakenif Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make agirl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation inlife.&mdash;They only give a little polish."</p><p>"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am moreanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.How well she looked last night!"</p><p>"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty."</p><p>"Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether&mdash;face and figure?"</p><p>"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I haveseldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am apartial old friend."</p><p>"Such an eye!&mdash;the true hazle eye&mdash;and so brilliant! regularfeatures, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of fullhealth, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and uprightfigure! There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, herhead, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture ofhealth;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the completepicture of grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, isnot she?"</p><p>"I have not a fault to find with her person," he replied. "I thinkher all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add thispraise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how veryhandsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanitylies another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislikeof Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm."</p><p>"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its notdoing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she is anexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kindersister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may betrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make nolasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundredtimes."</p><p>"Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel,and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John andIsabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blindaffection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is notquite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having theiropinions with me."</p><p>"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust orunkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I considermyself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech thatEmma's mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do notthink any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy beingmade a matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; butsupposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from theintimacy, it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody buther father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an endto it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself. It has been somany years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office."</p><p>"Not at all," cried he; "I am much obliged to you for it. It is verygood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has oftenfound; for it shall be attended to."</p><p>"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about her sister."</p><p>"Be satisfied," said he, "I will not raise any outcry. I will keepmy ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma.Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greaterinterest; perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity inwhat one feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!"</p><p>"So do I," said Mrs. Weston gently, "very much."</p><p>"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, meansjust nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen aman she cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very muchin love with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and insome doubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobodyhereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home."</p><p>"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break herresolution at present," said Mrs. Weston, "as can well be; and whileshe is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming anyattachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr.Woodhouse's account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma,though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you."</p><p>Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of herown and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There werewishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirableto have them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightleysoon afterwards made to "What does Weston think of the weather; shallwe have rain?" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmiseabout Hartfield.</p></body>
