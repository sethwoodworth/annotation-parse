<span id = 949 ><p>"The Portrait of a Lady" was, like "Roderick Hudson," begun in Florence, during three months spent there in the spring of 1879. Like "Roderick" and like "The American," it had been designed for publication in "The Atlantic Monthly," where it began to appear in 1880. It differed from its two predecessors, however, in finding a course also open to it, from month to month, in "Macmillan's Magazine"; which was to be for me one of the last occasions of simultaneous "serialisation" in the two countries that the changing conditions of literary intercourse between England and the United States had up to then left unaltered. It is a long novel, and I was long in writing it; I remember being again much occupied with it, the following year, during a stay of several weeks made in Venice. I had rooms on Riva Schiavoni, at the top of a house near the passage leading off to San Zaccaria; the waterside life, the wondrous lagoon spread before me, and the ceaseless human chatter of Venice came in at my windows, to which I seem to myself to have been constantly driven, in the fruitless fidget of composition, as if to see whether, out in the blue channel, the ship of some right suggestion, of some better phrase, of the next happy twist of my subject, the next true touch for my canvas, mightn't come into sight. But I recall vividly enough that the response most elicited, in general, to these restless appeals was the rather grim admonition that romantic and historic sites, such as the land of Italy abounds in, offer the artist a questionable aid to concentration when they themselves are not to be the subject of it. They are too rich in their own life and too charged with their own meanings merely to help him out with a lame phrase; they draw him away from his small question to their own greater ones; so that, after a little, he feels, while thus yearning toward them in his difficulty, as if he were asking an army of glorious veterans to help him to arrest a peddler who has given him the wrong change.</p><p>There are pages of the book which, in the reading over, have seemed to make me see again the bristling curve of the wide Riva, the large colour-spots of the balconied houses and the repeated undulation of the little hunchbacked bridges, marked by the rise and drop again, with the wave, of foreshortened clicking pedestrians. The Venetian footfall and the Venetian cry--all talk there, wherever uttered, having the pitch of a call across the water--come in once more at the window, renewing one's old impression of the delighted senses and the divided, frustrated mind. How can places that speak IN GENERAL so to the imagination not give it, at the moment, the particular thing it wants? I recollect again and again, in beautiful places, dropping into that wonderment. The real truth is, I think, that they express, under this appeal, only too much--more than, in the given case, one has use for; so that one finds one's self working less congruously, after all, so far as the surrounding picture is concerned, than in presence of the moderate and the neutral, to which we may lend something of the light of our vision. Such a place as Venice is too proud for such charities; Venice doesn't borrow, she but all magnificently gives. We profit by that enormously, but to do so we must either be quite off duty or be on it in her service alone. Such, and so rueful, are these reminiscences; though on the whole, no doubt, one's book, and one's "literary effort" at large, were to be the better for them. Strangely fertilising, in the long run, does a wasted effort of attention often prove. It all depends on HOW the attention has been cheated, has been squandered. There are high-handed insolent frauds, and there are insidious sneaking ones. And there is, I fear, even on the most designing artist's part, always witless enough good faith, always anxious enough desire, to fail to guard him against their deceits.</p><p>Trying to recover here, for recognition, the germ of my idea, I see that it must have consisted not at all in any conceit of a "plot," nefarious name, in any flash, upon the fancy, of a set of relations, or in any one of those situations that, by a logic of their own, immediately fall, for the fabulist, into movement, into a march or a rush, a patter of quick steps; but altogether in the sense of a single character, the character and aspect of a particular engaging young woman, to which all the usual elements of a "subject," certainly of a setting, were to need to be super added. Quite as interesting as the young woman herself at her best, do I find, I must again repeat, this projection of memory upon the whole matter of the growth, in one's imagination, of some such apology for a motive. These are the fascinations of the fabulist's art, these lurking forces of expansion, these necessities of upspringing in the seed, these beautiful determinations, on the part of the idea entertained, to grow as tall as possible, to push into the light and the air and thickly flower there; and, quite as much, these fine possibilities of recovering, from some good standpoint on the ground gained, the intimate history of the business--of retracing and reconstructing its steps and stages. I have always fondly remembered a remark that I heard fall years ago from the lips of Ivan Turgenieff in regard to his own experience of the usual origin of the fictive picture. It began for him almost always with the vision of some person or persons, who hovered before him, soliciting him, as the active or passive figure, interesting him and appealing to him just as they were and by what they were. He saw them, in that fashion, as disponibles, saw them subject to the chances, the complications of existence, and saw them vividly, but then had to find for them the right relations, those that would most bring them out; to imagine, to invent and select and piece together the situations most useful and favourable to the sense of the creatures themselves, the complications they would be most likely to produce and to feel.</p><p>"To arrive at these things is to arrive at my story," he said, "and that's the way I look for it. The result is that I'm often accused of not having 'story' enough. I seem to myself to have as much as I need--to show my people, to exhibit their relations with each other; for that is all my measure. If I watch them long enough I see them come together, I see them PLACED, I see them engaged in this or that act and in this or that difficulty. How they look and move and speak and behave, always in the setting I have found for them, is my account of them--of which I dare say, alas, que cela manque souvent d'architecture. But I would rather, I think, have too little architecture than too much--when there's danger of its interfering with my measure of the truth. The French of course like more of it than I give-- having by their own genius such a hand for it; and indeed one must give all one can. As for the origin of one's wind-blown germs themselves, who shall say, as you ask, where THEY come from? We have to go too far back, too far behind, to say. Isn't it all we can say that they come from every quarter of heaven, that they are THERE at almost any turn of the road? They accumulate, and we are always picking them over, selecting among them. They are the breath of life--by which I mean that life, in its own way, breathes them upon us. They are so, in a manner prescribed and imposed--floated into our minds by the current of life. That reduces to imbecility the vain critic's quarrel, so often, with one's subject, when he hasn't the wit to accept it. Will he point out then which other it should properly have been? --his office being, essentially to point out. Il en serait bien embarrasse. Ah, when he points out what I've done or failed to do with it, that's another matter: there he's on his ground. I give him up my 'sarchitecture,'" my distinguished friend concluded, "as much as he will."</p><p>So this beautiful genius, and I recall with comfort the gratitude I drew from his reference to the intensity of suggestion that may reside in the stray figure, the unattached character, the image en disponibilite. It gave me higher warrant than I seemed then to have met for just that blest habit of one's own imagination, the trick of investing some conceived or encountered individual, some brace or group of individuals, with the germinal property and authority. I was myself so much more antecedently conscious of my figures than of their setting--a too preliminary, a preferential interest in which struck me as in general such a putting of the cart before the horse. I might envy, though I couldn't emulate, the imaginative writer so constituted as to see his fable first and to make out its agents afterwards. I could think so little of any fable that didn't need its agents positively to launch it; I could think so little of any situation that didn't depend for its interest on the nature of the persons situated, and thereby on their way of taking it. There are methods of so-called presentation, I believe among novelists who have appeared to flourish--that offer the situation as indifferent to that support; but I have not lost the sense of the value for me, at the time, of the admirable Russian's testimony to my not needing, all superstitiously, to try and perform any such gymnastic. Other echoes from the same source linger with me, I confess, as unfadingly--if it be not all indeed one much-embracing echo. It was impossible after that not to read, for one's uses, high lucidity into the tormented and disfigured and bemuddled question of the objective value, and even quite into that of the critical appreciation, of "subject" in the novel.</p><p>One had had from an early time, for that matter, the instinct of the right estimate of such values and of its reducing to the inane the dull dispute over the "immoral" subject and the moral. Recognising so promptly the one measure of the worth of a given subject, the question about it that, rightly answered, disposes of all others--is it valid, in a word, is it genuine, is it sincere, the result of some direct impression or perception of life?--I had found small edification, mostly, in a critical pretension that had neglected from the first all delimitation of ground and all definition of terms. The air of my earlier time shows, to memory, as darkened, all round, with that vanity-- unless the difference to-day be just in one's own final impatience, the lapse of one's attention. There is, I think, no more nutritive or suggestive truth in this connexion than that of the perfect dependence of the "moral" sense of a work of art on the amount of felt life concerned in producing it. The question comes back thus, obviously, to the kind and the degree of the artist's prime sensibility, which is the soil out of which his subject springs. The quality and capacity of that soil, its ability to "grow" with due freshness and straightness any vision of life, represents, strongly or weakly, the projected morality. That element is but another name for the more or less close connexion of the subject with some mark made on the intelligence, with some sincere experience. By which, at the same time, of course, one is far from contending that this enveloping air of the artist's humanity--which gives the last touch to the worth of the work--is not a widely and wondrously varying element; being on one occasion a rich and magnificent medium and on another a comparatively poor and ungenerous one. Here we get exactly the high price of the novel as a literary form--its power not only, while preserving that form with closeness, to range through all the differences of the individual relation to its general subject-matter, all the varieties of outlook on life, of disposition to reflect and project, created by conditions that are never the same from man to man (or, so far as that goes, from man to woman), but positively to appear more true to its character in proportion as it strains, or tends to burst, with a latent extravagance, its mould.</p><p>The house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million-- a number of possible windows not to be reckoned, rather; every one of which has been pierced, or is still pierceable, in its vast front, by the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will. These apertures, of dissimilar shape and size, hang so, all together, over the human scene that we might have expected of them a greater sameness of report than we find. They are but windows at the best, mere holes in a dead wall, disconnected, perched aloft; they are not hinged doors opening straight upon life. But they have this mark of their own that at each of them stands a figure with a pair of eyes, or at least with a field-glass, which forms, again and again, for observation, a unique instrument, insuring to the person making use of it an impression distinct from every other. He and his neighbours are watching the same show, but one seeing more where the other sees less, one seeing black where the other sees white, one seeing big where the other sees small, one seeing coarse where the other sees fine. And so on, and so on; there is fortunately no saying on what, for the particular pair of eyes, the window may NOT open; "fortunately" by reason, precisely, of this incalculability of range. The spreading field, the human scene, is the "choice of subject"; the pierced aperture, either broad or balconied or slit-like and low-browed, is the "literary form"; but they are, singly or together, as nothing without the posted presence of the watcher--without, in other words, the consciousness of the artist. Tell me what the artist is, and I will tell you of what he has BEEN conscious. Thereby I shall express to you at once his boundless freedom and his "moral" reference.</p><p>All this is a long way round, however, for my word about my dim first move toward "The Portrait," which was exactly my grasp of a single character--an acquisition I had made, moreover, after a fashion not here to be retraced. Enough that I was, as seemed to me, in complete possession of it, that I had been so for a long time, that this had made it familiar and yet had not blurred its charm, and that, all urgently, all tormentingly, I saw it in motion and, so to speak, in transit. This amounts to saying that I saw it as bent upon its fate--some fate or other; which, among the possibilities, being precisely the question. Thus I had my vivid individual--vivid, so strangely, in spite of being still at large, not confined by the conditions, not engaged in the tangle, to which we look for much of the impress that constitutes an identity. If the apparition was still all to be placed how came it to be vivid?--since we puzzle such quantities out, mostly, just by the business of placing them. One could answer such a question beautifully, doubtless, if one could do so subtle, if not so monstrous, a thing as to write the history of the growth of one's imagination. One would describe then what, at a given time, had extraordinarily happened to it, and one would so, for instance, be in a position to tell, with an approach to clearness, how, under favour of occasion, it had been able to take over (take over straight from life) such and such a constituted, animated figure or form. The figure has to that extent, as you see, BEEN placed--placed in the imagination that detains it, preserves, protects, enjoys it, conscious of its presence in the dusky, crowded, heterogeneous back-shop of the mind very much as a wary dealer in precious odds and ends, competent to make an "advance" on rare objects confided to him, is conscious of the rare little "piece" left in deposit by the reduced, mysterious lady of title or the speculative amateur, and which is already there to disclose its merit afresh as soon as a key shall have clicked in a cupboard-door.</p><p>That may he, I recognise, a somewhat superfine analogy for the particular "value" I here speak of, the image of the young feminine nature that I had had for so considerable a time all curiously at my disposal; but it appears to fond memory quite to fit the fact--with the recall, in addition, of my pious desire but to place my treasure right. I quite remind myself thus of the dealer resigned not to "realise," resigned to keeping the precious object locked up indefinitely rather than commit it, at no matter what price, to vulgar hands. For there ARE dealers in these forms and figures and treasures capable of that refinement. The point is, however, that this single small corner-stone, the conception of a certain young woman affronting her destiny, had begun with being all my outfit for the large building of "The Portrait of a Lady." It came to be a square and spacious house-- or has at least seemed so to me in this going over it again; but, such as it is, it had to be put up round my young woman while she stood there in perfect isolation. That is to me, artistically speaking, the circumstance of interest; for I have lost myself once more, I confess, in the curiosity of analysing the structure. By what process of logical accretion was this slight "personality," the mere slim shade of an intelligent but presumptuous girl, to find itself endowed with the high attributes of a Subject?--and indeed by what thinness, at the best, would such a subject not be vitiated? Millions of presumptuous girls, intelligent or not intelligent, daily affront their destiny, and what is it open to their destiny to be, at the most, that we should make an ado about it? The novel is of its very nature an "ado," an ado about something, and the larger the form it takes the greater of course the ado. Therefore, consciously, that was what one was in for--for positively organising an ado about Isabel Archer.</p><p>One looked it well in the face, I seem to remember, this extravagance; and with the effect precisely of recognising the charm of the problem. Challenge any such problem with any intelligence, and you immediately see how full it is of substance; the wonder being, all the while, as we look at the world, how absolutely, how inordinately, the Isabel Archers, and even much smaller female fry, insist on mattering. George Eliot has admirably noted it--"In these frail vessels is borne onward through the ages the treasure of human affection." In "Romeo and Juliet" Juliet has to be important, just as, in "Adam Bede" and "The Mill on the Floss" and "Middlemarch" and "Daniel Deronda," Hetty Sorrel and Maggie Tulliver and Rosamond Vincy and Gwendolen Harleth have to be; with that much of firm ground, that much of bracing air, at the disposal all the while of their feet and their lungs. They are typical, none the less, of a class difficult, in the individual case, to make a centre of interest; so difficult in fact that many an expert painter, as for instance Dickens and Walter Scott, as for instance even, in the main, so subtle a hand as that of R. L. Stevenson, has preferred to leave the task unattempted. There are in fact writers as to whom we make out that their refuge from this is to assume it to be not worth their attempting; by which pusillanimity in truth their honour is scantly saved. It is never an attestation of a value, or even of our imperfect sense of one, it is never a tribute to any truth at all, that we shall represent that value badly. It never makes up, artistically, for an artist's dim feeling about a thing that he shall "do" the thing as ill as possible. There are better ways than that, the best of all of which is to begin with less stupidity.</p><p>It may be answered meanwhile, in regard to Shakespeare's and to George Eliot's testimony, that their concession to the "importance" of their Juliets and Cleopatras and Portias (even with Portia as the very type and model of the young person intelligent and presumptuous) and to that of their Hettys and Maggies and Rosamonds and Gwendolens, suffers the abatement that these slimnesses are, when figuring as the main props of the theme, never suffered to be sole ministers of its appeal, but have their inadequacy eked out with comic relief and underplots, as the playwrights say, when not with murders and battles and the great mutations of the world. If they are shown as "mattering" as much as they could possibly pretend to, the proof of it is in a hundred other persons, made of much stouter stuff; and each involved moreover in a hundred relations which matter to THEM concomitantly with that one. Cleopatra matters, beyond bounds, to Antony, but his colleagues, his antagonists, the state of Rome and the impending battle also prodigiously matter; Portia matters to Antonio, and to Shylock, and to the Prince of Morocco, to the fifty aspiring princes, but for these gentry there are other lively concerns; for Antonio, notably, there are Shylock and Bassanio and his lost ventures and the extremity of his predicament. This extremity indeed, by the same token, matters to Portia--though its doing so becomes of interest all by the fact that Portia matters to US. That she does so, at any rate, and that almost everything comes round to it again, supports my contention as to this fine example of the value recognised in the mere young thing. (I say "mere" young thing because I guess that even Shakespeare, preoccupied mainly though he may have been with the passions of princes, would scarce have pretended to found the best of his appeal for her on her high social position.) It is an example exactly of the deep difficulty braved--the difficulty of making George Eliot's "frail vessel," if not the all-in-all for our attention, at least the clearest of the call.</p><p>Now to see deep difficulty braved is at any time, for the really addicted artist, to feel almost even as a pang the beautiful incentive, and to feel it verily in such sort as to wish the danger intensified. The difficulty most worth tackling can only be for him, in these conditions, the greatest the case permits of. So I remember feeling here (in presence, always, that is, of the particular uncertainty of my ground), that there would be one way better than another--oh, ever so much better than any other!-- of making it fight out its battle. The frail vessel, that charged with George Eliot's "treasure," and thereby of such importance to those who curiously approach it, has likewise possibilities of importance to itself, possibilities which permit of treatment and in fact peculiarly require it from the moment they are considered at all. There is always the escape from any close account of the weak agent of such spells by using as a bridge for evasion, for retreat and flight, the view of her relation to those surrounding her. Make it predominantly a view of THEIR relation and the trick is played: you give the general sense of her effect, and you give it, so far as the raising on it of a superstructure goes, with the maximum of ease. Well, I recall perfectly how little, in my now quite established connexion, the maximum of ease appealed to me, and how I seemed to get rid of it by an honest transposition of the weights in the two scales. "Place the centre of the subject in the young woman's own consciousness," I said to myself, "and you get as interesting and as beautiful a difficulty as you could wish. Stick to THAT--for the centre; put the heaviest weight into THAT scale, which will be so largely the scale of her relation to herself. Make her only interested enough, at the same time, in the things that are not herself, and this relation needn't fear to be too limited. Place meanwhile in the other scale the lighter weight (which is usually the one that tips the balance of interest): press least hard, in short, on the consciousness of your heroine's satellites, especially the male; make it an interest contributive only to the greater one. See, at all events, what can be done in this way. What better field could there be for a due ingenuity? The girl hovers, inextinguishable, as a charming creature, and the job will be to translate her into the highest terms of that formula, and as nearly as possible moreover into ALL of them. To depend upon her and her little concerns wholly to see you through will necessitate, remember, your really 'doing' her."</p><p>So far I reasoned, and it took nothing less than that technical rigour, I now easily see, to inspire me with the right confidence for erecting on such a plot of ground the neat and careful and proportioned pile of bricks that arches over it and that was thus to form, constructionally speaking, a literary monument. Such is the aspect that to-day "The Portrait" wears for me: a structure reared with an "architectural" competence, as Turgenieff would have said, that makes it, to the author's own sense, the most proportioned of his productions after "The Ambassadors" which was to follow it so many years later and which has, no doubt, a superior roundness. On one thing I was determined; that, though I should clearly have to pile brick upon brick for the creation of an interest, I would leave no pretext for saying that anything is out of line, scale or perspective. I would build large--in fine embossed vaults and painted arches, as who should say, and yet never let it appear that the chequered pavement, the ground under the reader's feet, fails to stretch at every point to the base of the walls. That precautionary spirit, on re-perusal of the book, is the old note that most touches me: it testifies so, for my own ear, to the anxiety of my provision for the reader's amusement. I felt, in view of the possible limitations of my subject, that no such provision could be excessive, and the development of the latter was simply the general form of that earnest quest. And I find indeed that this is the only account I can give myself of the evolution of the fable it is all under the head thus named that I conceive the needful accretion as having taken place, the right complications as having started. It was naturally of the essence that the young woman should be herself complex; that was rudimentary--or was at any rate the light in which Isabel Archer had originally dawned. It went, however, but a certain way, and other lights, contending, conflicting lights, and of as many different colours, if possible, as the rockets, the Roman candles and Catherine-wheels of a "pyrotechnic display," would be employable to attest that she was. I had, no doubt, a groping instinct for the right complications, since I am quite unable to track the footsteps of those that constitute, as the case stands, the general situation exhibited. They are there, for what they are worth, and as numerous as might be; but my memory, I confess, is a blank as to how and whence they came.</p><p>I seem to myself to have waked up one morning in possession of them--of Ralph Touchett and his parents, of Madame Merle, of Gilbert Osmond and his daughter and his sister, of Lord Warburton, Caspar Goodwood and Miss Stackpole, the definite array of contributions to Isabel Archer's history. I recognised them, I knew them, they were the numbered pieces of my puzzle, the concrete terms of my "plot." It was as if they had simply, by an impulse of their own, floated into my ken, and all in response to my primary question: "Well, what will she DO?" Their answer seemed to be that if I would trust them they would show me; on which, with an urgent appeal to them to make it at least as interesting as they could, I trusted them. They were like the group of attendants and entertainers who come down by train when people in the country give a party; they represented the contract for carrying the party on. That was an excellent relation with them --a possible one even with so broken a reed (from her slightness of cohesion) as Henrietta Stackpole. It is a familiar truth to the novelist, at the strenuous hour, that, as certain elements in any work are of the essence, so others are only of the form; that as this or that character, this or that disposition of the material, belongs to the subject directly, so to speak, so this or that other belongs to it but indirectly--belongs intimately to the treatment. This is a truth, however, of which he rarely gets the benefit--since it could be assured to him, really, but by criticism based upon perception, criticism which is too little of this world. He must not think of benefits, moreover, I freely recognise, for that way dishonour lies: he has, that is, but one to think of--the benefit, whatever it may be, involved in his having cast a spell upon the simpler, the very simplest, forms of attention. This is all he is entitled to; he is entitled to nothing, he is bound to admit, that can come to him, from the reader, as a result on the latter's part of any act of reflexion or discrimination. He may ENJOY this finer tribute--that is another affair, but on condition only of taking it as a gratuity "thrown in," a mere miraculous windfall, the fruit of a tree he may not pretend to have shaken. Against reflexion, against discrimination, in his interest, all earth and air conspire; wherefore it is that, as I say, he must in many a case have schooled himself, from the first, to work but for a "living wage." The living wage is the reader's grant of the least possible quantity of attention required for consciousness of a "spell." The occasional charming "tip" is an act of his intelligence over and beyond this, a golden apple, for the writer's lap, straight from the wind-stirred tree. The artist may of course, in wanton moods, dream of some Paradise (for art) where the direct appeal to the intelligence might be legalised; for to such extravagances as these his yearning mind can scarce hope ever completely to close itself. The most he can do is to remember they ARE extravagances.</p><p>All of which is perhaps but a gracefully devious way of saying that Henrietta Stackpole was a good example, in "The Portrait," of the truth to which I just adverted--as good an example as I could name were it not that Maria Gostrey, in "The Ambassadors," then in the bosom of time, may be mentioned as a better. Each of these persons is but wheels to the coach; neither belongs to the body of that vehicle, or is for a moment accommodated with a seat inside. There the subject alone is ensconced, in the form of its "hero and heroine," and of the privileged high officials, say, who ride with the king and queen. There are reasons why one would have liked this to be felt, as in general one would like almost anything to be felt, in one's work, that one has one's self contributively felt. We have seen, however, how idle is that pretension, which I should be sorry to make too much of. Maria Gostrey and Miss Stackpole then are cases, each, of the light ficelle, not of the true agent; they may run beside the coach "for all they are worth," they may cling to it till they are out of breath (as poor Miss Stackpole all so visibly does), but neither, all the while, so much as gets her foot on the step, neither ceases for a moment to tread the dusty road. Put it even that they are like the fishwives who helped to bring back to Paris from Versailles, on that most ominous day of the first half of the French Revolution, the carriage of the royal family. The only thing is that I may well be asked, I acknowledge, why then, in the present fiction, I have suffered Henrietta (of whom we have indubitably too much) so officiously, so strangely, so almost inexplicably, to pervade. I will presently say what I can for that anomaly--and in the most conciliatory fashion.</p><p>A point I wish still more to make is that if my relation of confidence with the actors in my drama who WERE, unlike Miss Stackpole, true agents, was an excellent one to have arrived at, there still remained my relation with the reader, which was another affair altogether and as to which I felt no one to be trusted but myself. That solicitude was to be accordingly expressed in the artful patience with which, as I have said, I piled brick upon brick. The bricks, for the whole counting-over-- putting for bricks little touches and inventions and enhancements by the way--affect me in truth as well-nigh innumerable and as ever so scrupulously fitted together and packed-in. It is an effect of detail, of the minutest; though, if one were in this connexion to say all, one would express the hope that the general, the ampler air of the modest monument still survives. I do at least seem to catch the key to a part of this abundance of small anxious, ingenious illustration as I recollect putting my finger, in my young woman's interest, on the most obvious of her predicates. "What will she 'do'? Why, the first thing she'll do will be to come to Europe; which in fact will form, and all inevitably, no small part of her principal adventure. Coming to Europe is even for the 'frail vessels,' in this wonderful age, a mild adventure; but what is truer than that on one side--the side of their independence of flood and field, of the moving accident, of battle and murder and sudden death--her adventures are to be mild? Without her sense of them, her sense FOR them, as one may say, they are next to nothing at all; but isn't the beauty and the difficulty just in showing their mystic conversion by that sense, conversion into the stuff of drama or, even more delightful word still, of 'story'?" It was all as clear, my contention, as a silver bell. Two very good instances, I think, of this effect of conversion, two cases of the rare chemistry, are the pages in which Isabel, coming into the drawing-room at Gardencourt, coming in from a wet walk or whatever, that rainy afternoon, finds Madame Merle in possession of the place, Madame Merle seated, all absorbed but all serene, at the piano, and deeply recognises, in the striking of such an hour, in the presence there, among the gathering shades, of this personage, of whom a moment before she had never so much as heard, a turning-point in her life. It is dreadful to have too much, for any artistic demonstration, to dot one's i's and insist on one's intentions, and I am not eager to do it now; but the question here was that of producing the maximum of intensity with the minimum of strain.</p><p>The interest was to be raised to its pitch and yet the elements to be kept in their key; so that, should the whole thing duly impress, I might show what an "exciting" inward life may do for the person leading it even while it remains perfectly normal. And I cannot think of a more consistent application of that ideal unless it be in the long statement, just beyond the middle of the book, of my young woman's extraordinary meditative vigil on the occasion that was to become for her such a landmark. Reduced to its essence, it is but the vigil of searching criticism; but it throws the action further forward that twenty "incidents" might have done. It was designed to have all the vivacity of incidents and all the economy of picture. She sits up, by her dying fire, far into the night, under the spell of recognitions on which she finds the last sharpness suddenly wait. It is a representation simply of her motionlessly SEEING, and an attempt withal to make the mere still lucidity of her act as "interesting" as the surprise of a caravan or the identification of a pirate. It represents, for that matter, one of the identifications dear to the novelist, and even indispensable to him; but it all goes on without her being approached by another person and without her leaving her chair. It is obviously the best thing in the book, but it is only a supreme illustration of the general plan. As to Henrietta, my apology for whom I just left incomplete, she exemplifies, I fear, in her superabundance, not an element of my plan, but only an excess of my zeal. So early was to begin my tendency to OVERTREAT, rather than undertreat (when there was choice or danger) my subject. (Many members of my craft, I gather, are far from agreeing with me, but I have always held overtreating the minor disservice.) "Treating" that of "The Portrait" amounted to never forgetting, by any lapse, that the thing was under a special obligation to be amusing. There was the danger of the noted "thinness"--which was to be averted, tooth and nail, by cultivation of the lively. That is at least how I see it to-day. Henrietta must have been at that time a part of my wonderful notion of the lively. And then there was another matter. I had, within the few preceding years, come to live in London, and the "international" light lay, in those days, to my sense, thick and rich upon the scene. It was the light in which so much of the picture hung. But that IS another matter. There is really too much to say.</p><p>HENRY JAMES<br /></p></span><span id = 950 ><p>Under certain circumstances there are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea. There are circumstances in which, whether you partake of the tea or not--some people of course never do,--the situation is in itself delightful. Those that I have in mind in beginning to unfold this simple history offered an admirable setting to an innocent pastime. The implements of the little feast had been disposed upon the lawn of an old English country-house, in what I should call the perfect middle of a splendid summer afternoon. Part of the afternoon had waned, but much of it was left, and what was left was of the finest and rarest quality. Real dusk would not arrive for many hours; but the flood of summer light had begun to ebb, the air had grown mellow, the shadows were long upon the smooth, dense turf. They lengthened slowly, however, and the scene expressed that sense of leisure still to come which is perhaps the chief source of one's enjoyment of such a scene at such an hour. From five o'clock to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure. The persons concerned in it were taking their pleasure quietly, and they were not of the sex which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of the ceremony I have mentioned. The shadows on the perfect lawn were straight and angular; they were the shadows of an old man sitting in a deep wicker-chair near the low table on which the tea had been served, and of two younger men strolling to and fro, in desultory talk, in front of him. The old man had his cup in his hand; it was an unusually large cup, of a different pattern from the rest of the set and painted in brilliant colours. He disposed of its contents with much circumspection, holding it for a long time close to his chin, with his face turned to the house. His companions had either finished their tea or were indifferent to their privilege; they smoked cigarettes as they continued to stroll. One of them, from time to time, as he passed, looked with a certain attention at the elder man, who, unconscious of observation, rested his eyes upon the rich red front of his dwelling. The house that rose beyond the lawn was a structure to repay such consideration and was the most characteristic object in the peculiarly English picture I have attempted to sketch.</p><p>It stood upon a low hill, above the river--the river being the Thames at some forty miles from London. A long gabled front of red brick, with the complexion of which time and the weather had played all sorts of pictorial tricks, only, however, to improve and refine it, presented to the lawn its patches of ivy, its clustered chimneys, its windows smothered in creepers. The house had a name and a history; the old gentleman taking his tea would have been delighted to tell you these things: how it had been built under Edward the Sixth, had offered a night's hospitality to the great Elizabeth (whose august person had extended itself upon a huge, magnificent and terribly angular bed which still formed the principal honour of the sleeping apartments), had been a good deal bruised and defaced in Cromwell's wars, and then, under the Restoration, repaired and much enlarged; and how, finally, after having been remodelled and disfigured in the eighteenth century, it had passed into the careful keeping of a shrewd American banker, who had bought it originally because (owing to circumstances too complicated to set forth) it was offered at a great bargain: bought it with much grumbling at its ugliness, its antiquity, its incommodity, and who now, at the end of twenty years, had become conscious of a real aesthetic passion for it, so that he knew all its points and would tell you just where to stand to see them in combination and just the hour when the shadows of its various protuberances which fell so softly upon the warm, weary brickwork--were of the right measure. Besides this, as I have said, he could have counted off most of the successive owners and occupants, several of whom were known to general fame; doing so, however, with an undemonstrative conviction that the latest phase of its destiny was not the least honourable. The front of the house overlooking that portion of the lawn with which we are concerned was not the entrance-front; this was in quite another quarter. Privacy here reigned supreme, and the wide carpet of turf that covered the level hill-top seemed but the extension of a luxurious interior. The great still oaks and beeches flung down a shade as dense as that of velvet curtains; and the place was furnished, like a room, with cushioned seats, with rich-coloured rugs, with the books and papers that lay upon the grass. The river was at some distance; where the ground began to slope the lawn, properly speaking, ceased. But it was none the less a charming walk down to the water.</p><p>The old gentleman at the tea-table, who had come from America thirty years before, had brought with him, at the top of his baggage, his American physiognomy; and he had not only brought it with him, but he had kept it in the best order, so that, if necessary, he might have taken it back to his own country with perfect confidence. At present, obviously, nevertheless, he was not likely to displace himself; his journeys were over and he was taking the rest that precedes the great rest. He had a narrow, clean-shaven face, with features evenly distributed and an expression of placid acuteness. It was evidently a face in which the range of representation was not large, so that the air of contented shrewdness was all the more of a merit. It seemed to tell that he had been successful in life, yet it seemed to tell also that his success had not been exclusive and invidious, but had had much of the inoffensiveness of failure. He had certainly had a great experience of men, but there was an almost rustic simplicity in the faint smile that played upon his lean, spacious cheek and lighted up his humorous eye as he at last slowly and carefully deposited his big tea-cup upon the table. He was neatly dressed, in well-brushed black; but a shawl was folded upon his knees, and his feet were encased in thick, embroidered slippers. A beautiful collie dog lay upon the grass near his chair, watching the master's face almost as tenderly as the master took in the still more magisterial physiognomy of the house; and a little bristling, bustling terrier bestowed a desultory attendance upon the other gentlemen.</p><p>One of these was a remarkably well-made man of five-and-thirty, with a face as English as that of the old gentleman I have just sketched was something else; a noticeably handsome face, fresh- coloured, fair and frank, with firm, straight features, a lively grey eye and the rich adornment of a chestnut beard. This person had a certain fortunate, brilliant exceptional look--the air of a happy temperament fertilised by a high civilisation--which would have made almost any observer envy him at a venture. He was booted and spurred, as if he had dismounted from a long ride; he wore a white hat, which looked too large for him; he held his two hands behind him, and in one of them--a large, white, well-shaped fist--was crumpled a pair of soiled dog-skin gloves.</p><p>His companion, measuring the length of the lawn beside him, was a person of quite a different pattern, who, although he might have excited grave curiosity, would not, like the other, have provoked you to wish yourself, almost blindly, in his place. Tall, lean, loosely and feebly put together, he had an ugly, sickly, witty, charming face, furnished, but by no means decorated, with a straggling moustache and whisker. He looked clever and ill--a combination by no means felicitous; and he wore a brown velvet jacket. He carried his hands in his pockets, and there was something in the way he did it that showed the habit was inveterate. His gait had a shambling, wandering quality; he was not very firm on his legs. As I have said, whenever he passed the old man in the chair he rested his eyes upon him; and at this moment, with their faces brought into relation, you would easily have seen they were father and son. The father caught his son's eye at last and gave him a mild, responsive smile.</p><p>"I'm getting on very well," he said.</p><p>"Have you drunk your tea?" asked the son.</p><p>"Yes, and enjoyed it."</p><p>"Shall I give you some more?"</p><p>The old man considered, placidly. "Well, I guess I'll wait and see." He had, in speaking, the American tone.</p><p>"Are you cold?" the son enquired.</p><p>The father slowly rubbed his legs. "Well, I don't know. I can't tell till I feel."</p><p>"Perhaps some one might feel for you," said the younger man, laughing.</p><p>"Oh, I hope some one will always feel for me! Don't you feel for me, Lord Warburton?"</p><p>"Oh yes, immensely," said the gentleman addressed as Lord Warburton, promptly. "I'm bound to say you look wonderfully comfortable."</p><p>"Well, I suppose I am, in most respects." And the old man looked down at his green shawl and smoothed it over his knees. "The fact is I've been comfortable so many years that I suppose I've got so used to it I don't know it."</p><p>"Yes, that's the bore of comfort," said Lord Warburton. "We only know when we're uncomfortable."</p><p>"It strikes me we're rather particular," his companion remarked.</p><p>"Oh yes, there's no doubt we're particular," Lord Warburton murmured. And then the three men remained silent a while; the two younger ones standing looking down at the other, who presently asked for more tea. "I should think you would be very unhappy with that shawl," Lord Warburton resumed while his companion filled the old man's cup again.</p><p>"Oh no, he must have the shawl!" cried the gentleman in the velvet coat. "Don't put such ideas as that into his head."</p><p>"It belongs to my wife," said the old man simply.</p><p>"Oh, if it's for sentimental reasons--" And Lord Warburton made a gesture of apology.</p><p>"I suppose I must give it to her when she comes," the old man went on.</p><p>"You'll please to do nothing of the kind. You'll keep it to cover your poor old legs."</p><p>"Well, you mustn't abuse my legs," said the old man. "I guess they are as good as yours."</p><p>"Oh, you're perfectly free to abuse mine," his son replied, giving him his tea.</p><p>"Well, we're two lame ducks; I don't think there's much difference."</p><p>"I'm much obliged to you for calling me a duck. How's your tea?"</p><p>"Well, it's rather hot."</p><p>"That's intended to be a merit."</p><p>"Ah, there's a great deal of merit," murmured the old man, kindly. "He's a very good nurse, Lord Warburton."</p><p>"Isn't he a bit clumsy?" asked his lordship.</p><p>"Oh no, he's not clumsy--considering that he's an invalid himself. He's a very good nurse--for a sick-nurse. I call him my sick-nurse because he's sick himself."</p><p>"Oh, come, daddy!" the ugly young man exclaimed.</p><p>"Well, you are; I wish you weren't. But I suppose you can't help it."</p><p>"I might try: that's an idea," said the young man.</p><p>"Were you ever sick, Lord Warburton?" his father asked.</p><p>Lord Warburton considered a moment. "Yes, sir, once, in the Persian Gulf."</p><p>"He's making light of you, daddy," said the other young man. "That's a sort of joke."</p><p>"Well, there seem to be so many sorts now," daddy replied, serenely. "You don't look as if you had been sick, any way, Lord Warburton."</p><p>"He's sick of life; he was just telling me so; going on fearfully about it," said Lord Warburton's friend.</p><p>"Is that true, sir?" asked the old man gravely.</p><p>"If it is, your son gave me no consolation. He's a wretched fellow to talk to--a regular cynic. He doesn't seem to believe in anything."</p><p>"That's another sort of joke," said the person accused of cynicism.</p><p>"It's because his health is so poor," his father explained to Lord Warburton. "It affects his mind and colours his way of looking at things; he seems to feel as if he had never had a chance. But it's almost entirely theoretical, you know; it doesn't seem to affect his spirits. I've hardly ever seen him when he wasn't cheerful--about as he is at present. He often cheers me up."</p><p>The young man so described looked at Lord Warburton and laughed. "Is it a glowing eulogy or an accusation of levity? Should you like me to carry out my theories, daddy?"</p><p>"By Jove, we should see some queer things!" cried Lord Warburton.</p><p>"I hope you haven't taken up that sort of tone," said the old man.</p><p>"Warburton's tone is worse than mine; he pretends to be bored. I'm not in the least bored; I find life only too interesting."</p><p>"Ah, too interesting; you shouldn't allow it to be that, you know!"</p><p>"I'm never bored when I come here," said Lord Warburton. "One gets such uncommonly good talk."</p><p>"Is that another sort of joke?" asked the old man. "You've no excuse for being bored anywhere. When I was your age I had never heard of such a thing."</p><p>"You must have developed very late."</p><p>"No, I developed very quick; that was just the reason. When I was twenty years old I was very highly developed indeed. I was working tooth and nail. You wouldn't be bored if you had something to do; but all you young men are too idle. You think too much of your pleasure. You're too fastidious, and too indolent, and too rich."</p><p>"Oh, I say," cried Lord Warburton, "you're hardly the person to accuse a fellow-creature of being too rich!"</p><p>"Do you mean because I'm a banker?" asked the old man.</p><p>"Because of that, if you like; and because you have--haven't you?--such unlimited means."</p><p>"He isn't very rich," the other young man mercifully pleaded. "He has given away an immense deal of money."</p><p>"Well, I suppose it was his own," said Lord Warburton; "and in that case could there be a better proof of wealth? Let not a public benefactor talk of one's being too fond of pleasure."</p><p>"Daddy's very fond of pleasure--of other people's."</p><p>The old man shook his head. "I don't pretend to have contributed anything to the amusement of my contemporaries."</p><p>"My dear father, you're too modest!"</p><p>"That's a kind of joke, sir," said Lord Warburton.</p><p>"You young men have too many jokes. When there are no jokes you've nothing left."</p><p>"Fortunately there are always more jokes," the ugly young man remarked.</p><p>"I don't believe it--I believe things are getting more serious. You young men will find that out."</p><p>"The increasing seriousness of things, then that's the great opportunity of jokes."</p><p>"They'll have to be grim jokes," said the old man. "I'm convinced there will be great changes, and not all for the better."</p><p>"I quite agree with you, sir," Lord Warburton declared. "I'm very sure there will be great changes, and that all sorts of queer things will happen. That's why I find so much difficulty in applying your advice; you know you told me the other day that I ought to 'take hold' of something. One hesitates to take hold of a thing that may the next moment be knocked sky-high."</p><p>"You ought to take hold of a pretty woman," said his companion. "He's trying hard to fall in love," he added, by way of explanation, to his father.</p><p>"The pretty women themselves may be sent flying!" Lord Warburton exclaimed.</p><p>"No, no, they'll be firm," the old man rejoined; "they'll not be affected by the social and political changes I just referred to."</p><p>"You mean they won't be abolished? Very well, then, I'll lay hands on one as soon as possible and tie her round my neck as a life-preserver."</p><p>"The ladies will save us," said the old man; "that is the best of them will--for I make a difference between them. Make up to a good one and marry her, and your life will become much more interesting."</p><p>A momentary silence marked perhaps on the part of his auditors a sense of the magnanimity of this speech, for it was a secret neither for his son nor for his visitor that his own experiment in matrimony had not been a happy one. As he said, however, he made a difference; and these words may have been intended as a confession of personal error; though of course it was not in place for either of his companions to remark that apparently the lady of his choice had not been one of the best.</p><p>"If I marry an interesting woman I shall be interested: is that what you say?" Lord Warburton asked. "I'm not at all keen about marrying--your son misrepresented me; but there's no knowing what an interesting woman might do with me."</p><p>"I should like to see your idea of an interesting woman," said his friend.</p><p>"My dear fellow, you can't see ideas--especially such highly ethereal ones as mine. If I could only see it myself--that would be a great step in advance."</p><p>"Well, you may fall in love with whomsoever you please; but you mustn't fall in love with my niece," said the old man.</p><p>His son broke into a laugh. "He'll think you mean that as a provocation! My dear father, you've lived with the English for thirty years, and you've picked up a good many of the things they say. But you've never learned the things they don't say!"</p><p>"I say what I please," the old man returned with all his serenity.</p><p>"I haven't the honour of knowing your niece," Lord Warburton said. "I think it's the first time I've heard of her."</p><p>"She's a niece of my wife's; Mrs. Touchett brings her to England."</p><p>Then young Mr. Touchett explained. "My mother, you know, has been spending the winter in America, and we're expecting her back. She writes that she has discovered a niece and that she has invited her to come out with her."</p><p>"I see,--very kind of her," said Lord Warburton. Is the young lady interesting?"</p><p>"We hardly know more about her than you; my mother has not gone into details. She chiefly communicates with us by means of telegrams, and her telegrams are rather inscrutable. They say women don't know how to write them, but my mother has thoroughly mastered the art of condensation. 'Tired America, hot weather awful, return England with niece, first steamer decent cabin.' That's the sort of message we get from her--that was the last that came. But there had been another before, which I think contained the first mention of the niece. 'Changed hotel, very bad, impudent clerk, address here. Taken sister's girl, died last year, go to Europe, two sisters, quite independent.' Over that my father and I have scarcely stopped puzzling; it seems to admit of so many interpretations."</p><p>"There's one thing very clear in it," said the old man; "she has given the hotel-clerk a dressing."</p><p>"I'm not sure even of that, since he has driven her from the field. We thought at first that the sister mentioned might be the sister of the clerk; but the subsequent mention of a niece seems to prove that the allusion is to one of my aunts. Then there was a question as to whose the two other sisters were; they are probably two of my late aunt's daughters. But who's 'quite independent,' and in what sense is the term used?--that point's not yet settled. Does the expression apply more particularly to the young lady my mother has adopted, or does it characterise her sisters equally?--and is it used in a moral or in a financial sense? Does it mean that they've been left well off, or that they wish to be under no obligations? or does it simply mean that they're fond of their own way?"</p><p>"Whatever else it means, it's pretty sure to mean that," Mr. Touchett remarked.</p><p>"You'll see for yourself," said Lord Warburton. "When does Mrs. Touchett arrive?"</p><p>"We're quite in the dark; as soon as she can find a decent cabin. She may be waiting for it yet; on the other hand she may already have disembarked in England."</p><p>"In that case she would probably have telegraphed to you."</p><p>"She never telegraphs when you would expect it--only when you don't," said the old man. "She likes to drop on me suddenly; she thinks she'll find me doing something wrong. She has never done so yet, but she's not discouraged."</p><p>"It's her share in the family trait, the independence she speaks of." Her son's appreciation of the matter was more favourable. "Whatever the high spirit of those young ladies may be, her own is a match for it. She likes to do everything for herself and has no belief in any one's power to help her. She thinks me of no more use than a postage-stamp without gum, and she would never forgive me if I should presume to go to Liverpool to meet her."</p><p>"Will you at least let me know when your cousin arrives?" Lord Warburton asked.</p><p>"Only on the condition I've mentioned--that you don't fall in love with her!" Mr. Touchett replied.</p><p>"That strikes me as hard, don't you think me good enough?"</p><p>"I think you too good--because I shouldn't like her to marry you. She hasn't come here to look for a husband, I hope; so many young ladies are doing that, as if there were no good ones at home. Then she's probably engaged; American girls are usually engaged, I believe. Moreover I'm not sure, after all, that you'd be a remarkable husband."</p><p>"Very likely she's engaged; I've known a good many American girls, and they always were; but I could never see that it made any difference, upon my word! As for my being a good husband," Mr. Touchett's visitor pursued, "I'm not sure of that either. One can but try!"</p><p>"Try as much as you please, but don't try on my niece," smiled the old man, whose opposition to the idea was broadly humorous.</p><p>"Ah, well," said Lord Warburton with a humour broader still, "perhaps, after all, she's not worth trying on!"<br /></p></span><span id = 951 ><p>While this exchange of pleasantries took place between the two Ralph Touchett wandered away a little, with his usual slouching gait, his hands in his pockets and his little rowdyish terrier at his heels. His face was turned toward the house, but his eyes were bent musingly on the lawn; so that he had been an object of observation to a person who had just made her appearance in the ample doorway for some moments before he perceived her. His attention was called to her by the conduct of his dog, who had suddenly darted forward with a little volley of shrill barks, in which the note of welcome, however, was more sensible than that of defiance. The person in question was a young lady, who seemed immediately to interpret the greeting of the small beast. He advanced with great rapidity and stood at her feet, looking up and barking hard; whereupon, without hesitation, she stooped and caught him in her hands, holding him face to face while he continued his quick chatter. His master now had had time to follow and to see that Bunchie's new friend was a tall girl in a black dress, who at first sight looked pretty. She was bareheaded, as if she were staying in the house--a fact which conveyed perplexity to the son of its master, conscious of that immunity from visitors which had for some time been rendered necessary by the latter's ill-health. Meantime the two other gentlemen had also taken note of the new-comer.</p><p>"Dear me, who's that strange woman?" Mr. Touchett had asked.</p><p>"Perhaps it's Mrs. Touchett's niece--the independent young lady," Lord Warburton suggested. "I think she must be, from the way she handles the dog."</p><p>The collie, too, had now allowed his attention to be diverted, and he trotted toward the young lady in the doorway, slowly setting his tail in motion as he went.</p><p>"But where's my wife then?" murmured the old man.</p><p>"I suppose the young lady has left her somewhere: that's a part of the independence."</p><p>The girl spoke to Ralph, smiling, while she still held up the terrier. "Is this your little dog, sir?"</p><p>"He was mine a moment ago; but you've suddenly acquired a remarkable air of property in him."</p><p>"Couldn't we share him?" asked the girl. "He's such a perfect little darling."</p><p>Ralph looked at her a moment; she was unexpectedly pretty. "You may have him altogether," he then replied.</p><p>The young lady seemed to have a great deal of confidence, both in herself and in others; but this abrupt generosity made her blush. "I ought to tell you that I'm probably your cousin," she brought out, putting down the dog. "And here's another!" she added quickly, as the collie came up.</p><p>"Probably?" the young man exclaimed, laughing. "I supposed it was quite settled! Have you arrived with my mother?"</p><p>"Yes, half an hour ago."</p><p>"And has she deposited you and departed again?"</p><p>"No, she went straight to her room, and she told me that, if I should see you, I was to say to you that you must come to her there at a quarter to seven."</p><p>The young man looked at his watch. "Thank you very much; I shall be punctual." And then he looked at his cousin. "You're very welcome here. I'm delighted to see you."</p><p>She was looking at everything, with an eye that denoted clear perception--at her companion, at the two dogs, at the two gentlemen under the trees, at the beautiful scene that surrounded her. "I've never seen anything so lovely as this place. I've been all over the house; it's too enchanting."</p><p>"I'm sorry you should have been here so long without our knowing it."</p><p>"Your mother told me that in England people arrived very quietly; so I thought it was all right. Is one of those gentlemen your father?"</p><p>"Yes, the elder one--the one sitting down," said Ralph.</p><p>The girl gave a laugh. "I don't suppose it's the other. Who's the other?"</p><p>"He's a friend of ours--Lord Warburton."</p><p>"Oh, I hoped there would be a lord; it's just like a novel!" And then, "Oh you adorable creature!" she suddenly cried, stooping down and picking up the small dog again.</p><p>She remained standing where they had met, making no offer to advance or to speak to Mr. Touchett, and while she lingered so near the threshold, slim and charming, her interlocutor wondered if she expected the old man to come and pay her his respects. American girls were used to a great deal of deference, and it had been intimated that this one had a high spirit. Indeed Ralph could see that in her face.</p><p>"Won't you come and make acquaintance with my father?" he nevertheless ventured to ask. "He's old and infirm--he doesn't leave his chair."</p><p>"Ah, poor man, I'm very sorry!" the girl exclaimed, immediately moving forward. "I got the impression from your mother that he was rather intensely active."</p><p>Ralph Touchett was silent a moment. "She hasn't seen him for a year."</p><p>"Well, he has a lovely place to sit. Come along, little hound."</p><p>"It's a dear old place," said the young man, looking sidewise at his neighbour.</p><p>"What's his name?" she asked, her attention having again reverted to the terrier.</p><p>"My father's name?"</p><p>"Yes," said the young lady with amusement; "but don't tell him I asked you."</p><p>They had come by this time to where old Mr. Touchett was sitting, and he slowly got up from his chair to introduce himself.</p><p>"My mother has arrived," said Ralph, "and this is Miss Archer."</p><p>The old man placed his two hands on her shoulders, looked at her a moment with extreme benevolence and then gallantly kissed her. "It's a great pleasure to me to see you here; but I wish you had given us a chance to receive you."</p><p>"Oh, we were received," said the girl. "There were about a dozen servants in the hall. And there was an old woman curtseying at the gate."</p><p>"We can do better than that--if we have notice!" And the old man stood there smiling, rubbing his hands and slowly shaking his head at her. "But Mrs. Touchett doesn't like receptions."</p><p>"She went straight to her room."</p><p>"Yes--and locked herself in. She always does that. Well, I suppose I shall see her next week." And Mrs. Touchett's husband slowly resumed his former posture.</p><p>"Before that," said Miss Archer. "She's coming down to dinner-- at eight o'clock. Don't you forget a quarter to seven," she added, turning with a smile to Ralph.</p><p>"What's to happen at a quarter to seven?"</p><p>"I'm to see my mother," said Ralph.</p><p>"Ah, happy boy!" the old man commented. "You must sit down--you must have some tea," he observed to his wife's niece.</p><p>"They gave me some tea in my room the moment I got there," this young lady answered. "I'm sorry you're out of health," she added, resting her eyes upon her venerable host.</p><p>"Oh, I'm an old man, my dear; it's time for me to be old. But I shall be the better for having you here."</p><p>She had been looking all round her again--at the lawn, the great trees, the reedy, silvery Thames, the beautiful old house; and while engaged in this survey she had made room in it for her companions; a comprehensiveness of observation easily conceivable on the part of a young woman who was evidently both intelligent and excited. She had seated herself and had put away the little dog; her white hands, in her lap, were folded upon her black dress; her head was erect, her eye lighted, her flexible figure turned itself easily this way and that, in sympathy with the alertness with which she evidently caught impressions. Her impressions were numerous, and they were all reflected in a clear, still smile. "I've never seen anything so beautiful as this."</p><p>"It's looking very well," said Mr. Touchett. "I know the way it strikes you. I've been through all that. But you're very beautiful yourself," he added with a politeness by no means crudely jocular and with the happy consciousness that his advanced age gave him the privilege of saying such things--even to young persons who might possibly take alarm at them.</p><p>What degree of alarm this young person took need not be exactly measured; she instantly rose, however, with a blush which was not a refutation. "Oh yes, of course I'm lovely!" she returned with a quick laugh. "How old is your house? Is it Elizabethan?"</p><p>"It's early Tudor," said Ralph Touchett.</p><p>She turned toward him, watching his face. "Early Tudor? How very delightful! And I suppose there are a great many others."</p><p>"There are many much better ones."</p><p>"Don't say that, my son!" the old man protested. "There's nothing better than this."</p><p>"I've got a very good one; I think in some respects it's rather better," said Lord Warburton, who as yet had not spoken, but who had kept an attentive eye upon Miss Archer. He slightly inclined himself, smiling; he had an excellent manner with women. The girl appreciated it in an instant; she had not forgotten that this was Lord Warburton. "I should like very much to show it to you," he added.</p><p>"Don't believe him," cried the old man; "don't look at it! It's a wretched old barrack--not to be compared with this."</p><p>"I don't know--I can't judge," said the girl, smiling at Lord Warburton.</p><p>In this discussion Ralph Touchett took no interest whatever; he stood with his hands in his pockets, looking greatly as if he should like to renew his conversation with his new-found cousin.</p><p>"Are you very fond of dogs?" he enquired by way of beginning. He seemed to recognise that it was an awkward beginning for a clever man.</p><p>"Very fond of them indeed."</p><p>"You must keep the terrier, you know," he went on, still awkwardly.</p><p>"I'll keep him while I'm here, with pleasure."</p><p>"That will be for a long time, I hope."</p><p>"You're very kind. I hardly know. My aunt must settle that."</p><p>"I'll settle it with her--at a quarter to seven." And Ralph looked at his watch again.</p><p>"I'm glad to be here at all," said the girl.</p><p>"I don't believe you allow things to be settled for you."</p><p>"Oh yes; if they're settled as I like them."</p><p>"I shall settle this as I like it," said Ralph. It's most unaccountable that we should never have known you."</p><p>"I was there--you had only to come and see me."</p><p>"There? Where do you mean?"</p><p>"In the United States: in New York and Albany and other American places."</p><p>"I've been there--all over, but I never saw you. I can't make it out."</p><p>Miss Archer just hesitated. "It was because there had been some disagreement between your mother and my father, after my mother's death, which took place when I was a child. In consequence of it we never expected to see you."</p><p>"Ah, but I don't embrace all my mother's quarrels--heaven forbid!" the young man cried. "You've lately lost your father?" he went on more gravely.</p><p>"Yes; more than a year ago. After that my aunt was very kind to me; she came to see me and proposed that I should come with her to Europe."</p><p>"I see," said Ralph. "She has adopted you."</p><p>"Adopted me?" The girl stared, and her blush came back to her, together with a momentary look of pain which gave her interlocutor some alarm. He had underestimated the effect of his words. Lord Warburton, who appeared constantly desirous of a nearer view of Miss Archer, strolled toward the two cousins at the moment, and as he did so she rested her wider eyes on him.</p><p>"Oh no; she has not adopted me. I'm not a candidate for adoption."</p><p>"I beg a thousand pardons," Ralph murmured. "I meant--I meant--" He hardly knew what he meant.</p><p>"You meant she has taken me up. Yes; she likes to take people up. She has been very kind to me; but," she added with a certain visible eagerness of desire to be explicit, "I'm very fond of my liberty."</p><p>"Are you talking about Mrs. Touchett?" the old man called out from his chair. "Come here, my dear, and tell me about her. I'm always thankful for information."</p><p>The girl hesitated again, smiling. "She's really very benevolent," she answered; after which she went over to her uncle, whose mirth was excited by her words.</p><p>Lord Warburton was left standing with Ralph Touchett, to whom in a moment he said: "You wished a while ago to see my idea of an interesting woman. There it is!"<br /></p></span><span id = 952 ><p>Mrs. Touchett was certainly a person of many oddities, of which her behaviour on returning to her husband's house after many months was a noticeable specimen. She had her own way of doing all that she did, and this is the simplest description of a character which, although by no means without liberal motions, rarely succeeded in giving an impression of suavity. Mrs. Touchett might do a great deal of good, but she never pleased. This way of her own, of which she was so fond, was not intrinsically offensive--it was just unmistakeably distinguished from the ways of others. The edges of her conduct were so very clear-cut that for susceptible persons it sometimes had a knife-like effect. That hard fineness came out in her deportment during the first hours of her return from America, under circumstances in which it might have seemed that her first act would have been to exchange greetings with her husband and son. Mrs. Touchett, for reasons which she deemed excellent, always retired on such occasions into impenetrable seclusion, postponing the more sentimental ceremony until she had repaired the disorder of dress with a completeness which had the less reason to be of high importance as neither beauty nor vanity were concerned in it. She was a plain-faced old woman, without graces and without any great elegance, but with an extreme respect for her own motives. She was usually prepared to explain these--when the explanation was asked as a favour; and in such a case they proved totally different from those that had been attributed to her. She was virtually separated from her husband, but she appeared to perceive nothing irregular in the situation. It had become clear, at an early stage of their community, that they should never desire the same thing at the same moment, and this appearance had prompted her to rescue disagreement from the vulgar realm of accident. She did what she could to erect it into a law--a much more edifying aspect of it--by going to live in Florence, where she bought a house and established herself; and by leaving her husband to take care of the English branch of his bank. This arrangement greatly pleased her; it was so felicitously definite. It struck her husband in the same light, in a foggy square in London, where it was at times the most definite fact he discerned; but he would have preferred that such unnatural things should have a greater vagueness. To agree to disagree had cost him an effort; he was ready to agree to almost anything but that, and saw no reason why either assent or dissent should be so terribly consistent. Mrs. Touchett indulged in no regrets nor speculations, and usually came once a year to spend a month with her husband, a period during which she apparently took pains to convince him that she had adopted the right system. She was not fond of the English style of life, and had three or four reasons for it to which she currently alluded; they bore upon minor points of that ancient order, but for Mrs. Touchett they amply justified non-residence. She detested bread-sauce, which, as she said, looked like a poultice and tasted like soap; she objected to the consumption of beer by her maid-servants; and she affirmed that the British laundress (Mrs. Touchett was very particular about the appearance of her linen) was not a mistress of her art. At fixed intervals she paid a visit to her own country; but this last had been longer than any of its predecessors.</p><p>She had taken up her niece--there was little doubt of that. One wet afternoon, some four months earlier than the occurrence lately narrated, this young lady had been seated alone with a book. To say she was so occupied is to say that her solitude did not press upon her; for her love of knowledge had a fertilising quality and her imagination was strong. There was at this time, however, a want of fresh taste in her situation which the arrival of an unexpected visitor did much to correct. The visitor had not been announced; the girl heard her at last walking about the adjoining room. It was in an old house at Albany, a large, square, double house, with a notice of sale in the windows of one of the lower apartments. There were two entrances, one of which had long been out of use but had never been removed. They were exactly alike--large white doors, with an arched frame and wide side-lights, perched upon little "stoops" of red stone, which descended sidewise to the brick pavement of the street. The two houses together formed a single dwelling, the party-wall having been removed and the rooms placed in communication. These rooms, above-stairs, were extremely numerous, and were painted all over exactly alike, in a yellowish white which had grown sallow with time. On the third floor there was a sort of arched passage, connecting the two sides of the house, which Isabel and her sisters used in their childhood to call the tunnel and which, though it was short and well lighted, always seemed to the girl to be strange and lonely, especially on winter afternoons. She had been in the house, at different periods, as a child; in those days her grandmother lived there. Then there had been an absence of ten years, followed by a return to Albany before her father's death. Her grandmother, old Mrs. Archer, had exercised, chiefly within the limits of the family, a large hospitality in the early period, and the little girls often spent weeks under her roof-- weeks of which Isabel had the happiest memory. The manner of life was different from that of her own home--larger, more plentiful, practically more festal; the discipline of the nursery was delightfully vague and the opportunity of listening to the conversation of one's elders (which with Isabel was a highly-valued pleasure) almost unbounded. There was a constant coming and going; her grandmother's sons and daughters and their children appeared to be in the enjoyment of standing invitations to arrive and remain, so that the house offered to a certain extent the appearance of a bustling provincial inn kept by a gentle old landlady who sighed a great deal and never presented a bill. Isabel of course knew nothing about bills; but even as a child she thought her grandmother's home romantic. There was a covered piazza behind it, furnished with a swing which was a source of tremulous interest; and beyond this was a long garden, sloping down to the stable and containing peach-trees of barely credible familiarity. Isabel had stayed with her grandmother at various seasons, but somehow all her visits had a flavour of peaches. On the other side, across the street, was an old house that was called the Dutch House--a peculiar structure dating from the earliest colonial time, composed of bricks that had been painted yellow, crowned with a gable that was pointed out to strangers, defended by a rickety wooden paling and standing sidewise to the street. It was occupied by a primary school for children of both sexes, kept or rather let go, by a demonstrative lady of whom Isabel's chief recollection was that her hair was fastened with strange bedroomy combs at the temples and that she was the widow of some one of consequence. The little girl had been offered the opportunity of laying a foundation of knowledge in this establishment; but having spent a single day in it, she had protested against its laws and had been allowed to stay at home, where, in the September days, when the windows of the Dutch House were open, she used to hear the hum of childish voices repeating the multiplication table--an incident in which the elation of liberty and the pain of exclusion were indistinguishably mingled. The foundation of her knowledge was really laid in the idleness of her grandmother's house, where, as most of the other inmates were not reading people, she had uncontrolled use of a library full of books with frontispieces, which she used to climb upon a chair to take down. When she had found one to her taste-- she was guided in the selection chiefly by the frontispiece-- she carried it into a mysterious apartment which lay beyond the library and which was called, traditionally, no one knew why, the office. Whose office it had been and at what period it had flourished, she never learned; it was enough for her that it contained an echo and a pleasant musty smell and that it was a chamber of disgrace for old pieces of furniture whose infirmities were not always apparent (so that the disgrace seemed unmerited and rendered them victims of injustice) and with which, in the manner of children, she had established relations almost human, certainly dramatic. There was an old haircloth sofa in especial, to which she had confided a hundred childish sorrows. The place owed much of its mysterious melancholy to the fact that it was properly entered from the second door of the house, the door that had been condemned, and that it was secured by bolts which a particularly slender little girl found it impossible to slide. She knew that this silent, motionless portal opened into the street; if the sidelights had not been filled with green paper she might have looked out upon the little brown stoop and the well-worn brick pavement. But she had no wish to look out, for this would have interfered with her theory that there was a strange, unseen place on the other side--a place which became to the child's imagination, according to its different moods, a region of delight or of terror.</p><p>It was in the "office" still that Isabel was sitting on that melancholy afternoon of early spring which I have just mentioned. At this time she might have had the whole house to choose from, and the room she had selected was the most depressed of its scenes. She had never opened the bolted door nor removed the green paper (renewed by other hands) from its sidelights; she had never assured herself that the vulgar street lay beyond. A crude, cold rain fell heavily; the spring-time was indeed an appeal-- and it seemed a cynical, insincere appeal--to patience. Isabel, however, gave as little heed as possible to cosmic treacheries; she kept her eyes on her book and tried to fix her mind. It had lately occurred to her that her mind was a good deal of a vagabond, and she had spent much ingenuity in training it to a military step and teaching it to advance, to halt, to retreat, to perform even more complicated manoeuvres, at the word of command. Just now she had given it marching orders and it had been trudging over the sandy plains of a history of German Thought. Suddenly she became aware of a step very different from her own intellectual pace; she listened a little and perceived that some one was moving in the library, which communicated with the office. It struck her first as the step of a person from whom she was looking for a visit, then almost immediately announced itself as the tread of a woman and a stranger--her possible visitor being neither. It had an inquisitive, experimental quality which suggested that it would not stop short of the threshold of the office; and in fact the doorway of this apartment was presently occupied by a lady who paused there and looked very hard at our heroine. She was a plain, elderly woman, dressed in a comprehensive waterproof mantle; she had a face with a good deal of rather violent point.</p><p>"Oh," she began, "is that where you usually sit?" She looked about at the heterogeneous chairs and tables.</p><p>"Not when I have visitors," said Isabel, getting up to receive the intruder.</p><p>She directed their course back to the library while the visitor continued to look about her. "You seem to have plenty of other rooms; they're in rather better condition. But everything's immensely worn."</p><p>"Have you come to look at the house?" Isabel asked. "The servant will show it to you."</p><p>"Send her away; I don't want to buy it. She has probably gone to look for you and is wandering about upstairs; she didn't seem at all intelligent. You had better tell her it's no matter." And then, since the girl stood there hesitating and wondering, this unexpected critic said to her abruptly: "I suppose you're one of the daughters?"</p><p>Isabel thought she had very strange manners. "It depends upon whose daughters you mean."</p><p>"The late Mr. Archer's--and my poor sister's."</p><p>"Ah," said Isabel slowly, "you must be our crazy Aunt Lydia!"</p><p>"Is that what your father told you to call me? I'm your Aunt Lydia, but I'm not at all crazy: I haven't a delusion! And which of the daughters are you?"</p><p>"I'm the youngest of the three, and my name's Isabel."</p><p>"Yes; the others are Lilian and Edith. And are you the prettiest?"</p><p>"I haven't the least idea," said the girl.</p><p>"I think you must be." And in this way the aunt and the niece made friends. The aunt had quarrelled years before with her brother-in-law, after the death of her sister, taking him to task for the manner in which he brought up his three girls. Being a high-tempered man he had requested her to mind her own business, and she had taken him at his word. For many years she held no communication with him and after his death had addressed not a word to his daughters, who had been bred in that disrespectful view of her which we have just seen Isabel betray. Mrs. Touchett's behaviour was, as usual, perfectly deliberate. She intended to go to America to look after her investments (with which her husband, in spite of his great financial position, had nothing to do) and would take advantage of this opportunity to enquire into the condition of her nieces. There was no need of writing, for she should attach no importance to any account of them she should elicit by letter; she believed, always, in seeing for one's self. Isabel found, however, that she knew a good deal about them, and knew about the marriage of the two elder girls; knew that their poor father had left very little money, but that the house in Albany, which had passed into his hands, was to be sold for their benefit; knew, finally, that Edmund Ludlow, Lilian's husband, had taken upon himself to attend to this matter, in consideration of which the young couple, who had come to Albany during Mr. Archer's illness, were remaining there for the present and, as well as Isabel herself, occupying the old place.</p><p>"How much money do you expect for it?" Mrs. Touchett asked of her companion, who had brought her to sit in the front parlour, which she had inspected without enthusiasm.</p><p>"I haven't the least idea," said the girl.</p><p>"That's the second time you have said that to me," her aunt rejoined. "And yet you don't look at all stupid."</p><p>"I'm not stupid; but I don't know anything about money."</p><p>"Yes, that's the way you were brought up--as if you were to inherit a million. What have you in point of fact inherited?"</p><p>"I really can't tell you. You must ask Edmund and Lilian; they'll be back in half an hour."</p><p>"In Florence we should call it a very bad house," said Mrs. Touchett; "but here, I dare say, it will bring a high price. It ought to make a considerable sum for each of you. In addition to that you must have something else; it's most extraordinary your not knowing. The position's of value, and they'll probably pull it down and make a row of shops. I wonder you don't do that yourself; you might let the shops to great advantage."</p><p>Isabel stared; the idea of letting shops was new to her. "I hope they won't pull it down," she said; "I'm extremely fond of it."</p><p>"I don't see what makes you fond of it; your father died here."</p><p>"Yes; but I don't dislike it for that," the girl rather strangely returned. "I like places in which things have happened--even if they're sad things. A great many people have died here; the place has been full of life."</p><p>"Is that what you call being full of life?"</p><p>"I mean full of experience--of people's feelings and sorrows. And not of their sorrows only, for I've been very happy here as a child."</p><p>"You should go to Florence if you like houses in which things have happened--especially deaths. I live in an old palace in which three people have been murdered; three that were known and I don't know how many more besides."</p><p>"In an old palace?" Isabel repeated.</p><p>"Yes, my dear; a very different affair from this. This is very bourgeois."</p><p>Isabel felt some emotion, for she had always thought highly of her grandmother's house. But the emotion was of a kind which led her to say: "I should like very much to go to Florence."</p><p>"Well, if you'll be very good, and do everything I tell you I'll take you there," Mrs. Touchett declared.</p><p>Our young woman's emotion deepened; she flushed a little and smiled at her aunt in silence. "Do everything you tell me? I don't think I can promise that."</p><p>"No, you don't look like a person of that sort. You're fond of your own way; but it's not for me to blame you."</p><p>"And yet, to go to Florence," the girl exclaimed in a moment, "I'd promise almost anything!"</p><p>Edmund and Lilian were slow to return, and Mrs. Touchett had an hour's uninterrupted talk with her niece, who found her a strange and interesting figure: a figure essentially--almost the first she had ever met. She was as eccentric as Isabel had always supposed; and hitherto, whenever the girl had heard people described as eccentric, she had thought of them as offensive or alarming. The term had always suggested to her something grotesque and even sinister. But her aunt made it a matter of high but easy irony, or comedy, and led her to ask herself if the common tone, which was all she had known, had ever been as interesting. No one certainly had on any occasion so held her as this little thin-lipped, bright-eyed, foreign-looking woman, who retrieved an insignificant appearance by a distinguished manner and, sitting there in a well-worn waterproof, talked with striking familiarity of the courts of Europe. There was nothing flighty about Mrs. Touchett, but she recognised no social superiors, and, judging the great ones of the earth in a way that spoke of this, enjoyed the consciousness of making an impression on a candid and susceptible mind. Isabel at first had answered a good many questions, and it was from her answers apparently that Mrs. Touchett derived a high opinion of her intelligence. But after this she had asked a good many, and her aunt's answers, whatever turn they took, struck her as food for deep reflexion. Mrs. Touchett waited for the return of her other niece as long as she thought reasonable, but as at six o'clock Mrs. Ludlow had not come in she prepared to take her departure.</p><p>"Your sister must be a great gossip. Is she accustomed to staying out so many hours?"</p><p>"You've been out almost as long as she," Isabel replied; "she can have left the house but a short time before you came in."</p><p>Mrs. Touchett looked at the girl without resentment; she appeared to enjoy a bold retort and to be disposed to be gracious. "Perhaps she hasn't had so good an excuse as I. Tell her at any rate that she must come and see me this evening at that horrid hotel. She may bring her husband if she likes, but she needn't bring you. I shall see plenty of you later."<br /></p></span><span id = 953 ><p>Mrs. Ludlow was the eldest of the three sisters, and was usually thought the most sensible; the classification being in general that Lilian was the practical one, Edith the beauty and Isabel the "intellectual" superior. Mrs. Keyes, the second of the group, was the wife of an officer of the United States Engineers, and as our history is not further concerned with her it will suffice that she was indeed very pretty and that she formed the ornament of those various military stations, chiefly in the unfashionable West, to which, to her deep chagrin, her husband was successively relegated. Lilian had married a New York lawyer, a young man with a loud voice and an enthusiasm for his profession; the match was not brilliant, any more than Edith's, but Lilian had occasionally been spoken of as a young woman who might be thankful to marry at all--she was so much plainer than her sisters. She was, however, very happy, and now, as the mother of two peremptory little boys and the mistress of a wedge of brown stone violently driven into Fifty-third Street, seemed to exult in her condition as in a bold escape. She was short and solid, and her claim to figure was questioned, but she was conceded presence, though not majesty; she had moreover, as people said, improved since her marriage, and the two things in life of which she was most distinctly conscious were her husband's force in argument and her sister Isabel's originality. "I've never kept up with Isabel--it would have taken all my time," she had often remarked; in spite of which, however, she held her rather wistfully in sight; watching her as a motherly spaniel might watch a free greyhound. "I want to see her safely married--that's what I want to see," she frequently noted to her husband.</p><p>"Well, I must say I should have no particular desire to marry her," Edmund Ludlow was accustomed to answer in an extremely audible tone.</p><p>"I know you say that for argument; you always take the opposite ground. I don't see what you've against her except that she's so original."</p><p>"Well, I don't like originals; I like translations," Mr. Ludlow had more than once replied. "Isabel's written in a foreign tongue. I can't make her out. She ought to marry an Armenian or a Portuguese."</p><p>"That's just what I'm afraid she'll do!" cried Lilian, who thought Isabel capable of anything.</p><p>She listened with great interest to the girl's account of Mrs. Touchett's appearance and in the evening prepared to comply with their aunt's commands. Of what Isabel then said no report has remained, but her sister's words had doubtless prompted a word spoken to her husband as the two were making ready for their visit. "I do hope immensely she'll do something handsome for Isabel; she has evidently taken a great fancy to her."</p><p>"What is it you wish her to do?" Edmund Ludlow asked. "Make her a big present?"</p><p>"No indeed; nothing of the sort. But take an interest in her-- sympathise with her. She's evidently just the sort of person to appreciate her. She has lived so much in foreign society; she told Isabel all about it. You know you've always thought Isabel rather foreign."</p><p>"You want her to give her a little foreign sympathy, eh? Don't you think she gets enough at home?"</p><p>"Well, she ought to go abroad," said Mrs. Ludlow. "She's just the person to go abroad."</p><p>"And you want the old lady to take her, is that it?"</p><p>"She has offered to take her--she's dying to have Isabel go. But what I want her to do when she gets her there is to give her all the advantages. I'm sure all we've got to do," said Mrs. Ludlow, "is to give her a chance."</p><p>"A chance for what?"</p><p>"A chance to develop."</p><p>"Oh Moses!" Edmund Ludlow exclaimed. "I hope she isn't going to develop any more!"</p><p>"If I were not sure you only said that for argument I should feel very badly," his wife replied. "But you know you love her."</p><p>"Do you know I love you?" the young man said, jocosely, to Isabel a little later, while he brushed his hat.</p><p>"I'm sure I don't care whether you do or not!" exclaimed the girl; whose voice and smile, however, were less haughty than her words.</p><p>"Oh, she feels so grand since Mrs. Touchett's visit," said her sister.</p><p>But Isabel challenged this assertion with a good deal of seriousness. "You must not say that, Lily. I don't feel grand at all."</p><p>"I'm sure there's no harm," said the conciliatory Lily.</p><p>"Ah, but there's nothing in Mrs. Touchett's visit to make one feel grand."</p><p>"Oh," exclaimed Ludlow, "she's grander than ever!"</p><p>"Whenever I feel grand," said the girl, "it will be for a better reason."</p><p>Whether she felt grand or no, she at any rate felt different, as if something had happened to her. Left to herself for the evening she sat a while under the lamp, her hands empty, her usual avocations unheeded. Then she rose and moved about the room, and from one room to another, preferring the places where the vague lamplight expired. She was restless and even agitated; at moments she trembled a little. The importance of what had happened was out of proportion to its appearance; there had really been a change in her life. What it would bring with it was as yet extremely indefinite; but Isabel was in a situation that gave a value to any change. She had a desire to leave the past behind her and, as she said to herself, to begin afresh. This desire indeed was not a birth of the present occasion; it was as familiar as the sound of the rain upon the window and it had led to her beginning afresh a great many times. She closed her eyes as she sat in one of the dusky corners of the quiet parlour; but it was not with a desire for dozing forgetfulness. It was on the contrary because she felt too wide-eyed and wished to check the sense of seeing too many things at once. Her imagination was by habit ridiculously active; when the door was not open it jumped out of the window. She was not accustomed indeed to keep it behind bolts; and at important moments, when she would have been thankful to make use of her judgement alone, she paid the penalty of having given undue encouragement to the faculty of seeing without judging. At present, with her sense that the note of change had been struck, came gradually a host of images of the things she was leaving behind her. The years and hours of her life came back to her, and for a long time, in a stillness broken only by the ticking of the big bronze clock, she passed them in review. It had been a very happy life and she had been a very fortunate person--this was the truth that seemed to emerge most vividly. She had had the best of everything, and in a world in which the circumstances of so many people made them unenviable it was an advantage never to have known anything particularly unpleasant. It appeared to Isabel that the unpleasant had been even too absent from her knowledge, for she had gathered from her acquaintance with literature that it was often a source of interest and even of instruction. Her father had kept it away from her--her handsome, much loved father, who always had such an aversion to it. It was a great felicity to have been his daughter; Isabel rose even to pride in her parentage. Since his death she had seemed to see him as turning his braver side to his children and as not having managed to ignore the ugly quite so much in practice as in aspiration. But this only made her tenderness for him greater; it was scarcely even painful to have to suppose him too generous, too good-natured, too indifferent to sordid considerations. Many persons had held that he carried this indifference too far, especially the large number of those to whom he owed money. Of their opinions Isabel was never very definitely informed; but it may interest the reader to know that, while they had recognised in the late Mr. Archer a remarkably handsome head and a very taking manner (indeed, as one of them had said, he was always taking something), they had declared that he was making a very poor use of his life. He had squandered a substantial fortune, he had been deplorably convivial, he was known to have gambled freely. A few very harsh critics went so far as to say that he had not even brought up his daughters. They had had no regular education and no permanent home; they had been at once spoiled and neglected; they had lived with nursemaids and governesses (usually very bad ones) or had been sent to superficial schools, kept by the French, from which, at the end of a month, they had been removed in tears. This view of the matter</p><p>would have excited Isabel's indignation, for to her own sense her opportunities had been large. Even when her father had left his daughters for three months at Neufchatel with a French bonne who had eloped with a Russian nobleman staying at the same hotel-- even in this irregular situation (an incident of the girl's eleventh year) she had been neither frightened nor ashamed, but had thought it a romantic episode in a liberal education. Her father had a large way of looking at life, of which his restlessness and even his occasional incoherency of conduct had been only a proof. He wished his daughters, even as children, to see as much of the world as possible; and it was for this purpose that, before Isabel was fourteen, he had transported them three times across the Atlantic, giving them on each occasion, however, but a few months' view of the subject proposed: a course which had whetted our heroine's curiosity without enabling her to satisfy it. She ought to have been a partisan of her father, for she was the member of his trio who most "made up" to him for the disagreeables he didn't mention. In his last days his general willingness to take leave of a world in which the difficulty of doing as one liked appeared to increase as one grew older had been sensibly modified by the pain of separation from his clever, his superior, his remarkable girl. Later, when the journeys to Europe ceased, he still had shown his children all sorts of indulgence, and if he had been troubled about money-matters nothing ever disturbed their irreflective consciousness of many possessions. Isabel, though she danced very well, had not the recollection of having been in New York a successful member of the choreographic circle; her sister Edith was, as every one said, so very much more fetching. Edith was so striking an example of success that Isabel could have no illusions as to what constituted this advantage, or as to the limits of her own power to frisk and jump and shriek--above all with rightness of effect. Nineteen persons out of twenty (including the younger sister herself) pronounced Edith infinitely the prettier of the two; but the twentieth, besides reversing this judgement, had the entertainment of thinking all the others aesthetic vulgarians. Isabel had in the depths of her nature an even more unquenchable desire to please than Edith; but the depths of this young lady's nature were a very out-of-the-way place, between which and the surface communication was interrupted by a dozen capricious forces. She saw the young men who came in large numbers to see her sister; but as a general thing they were afraid of her; they had a belief that some special preparation was required for talking with her. Her reputation of reading a great deal hung about her like the cloudy envelope of a goddess in an epic; it was supposed to engender difficult questions and to keep the conversation at a low temperature. The poor girl liked to be thought clever, but she hated to be thought bookish; she used to read in secret and, though her memory was excellent, to abstain from showy reference. She had a great desire for knowledge, but she really preferred almost any source of information to the printed page; she had an immense curiosity about life and was constantly staring and wondering. She carried within herself a great fund of life, and her deepest enjoyment was to feel the continuity between the movements of her own soul and the agitations of the world. For this reason she was fond of seeing great crowds and large stretches of country, of reading about revolutions and wars, of looking at historical pictures--a class of efforts as to which she had often committed the conscious solecism of forgiving them much bad painting for the sake of the subject. While the Civil War went on she was still a very young girl; but she passed months of this long period in a state of almost passionate excitement, in which she felt herself at times (to her extreme confusion) stirred almost indiscriminately by the valour of either army. Of course the circumspection of suspicious swains had never gone the length of making her a social proscript; for the number of those whose hearts, as they approached her, beat only just fast enough to remind them they had heads as well, had kept her unacquainted with the supreme disciplines of her sex and age. She had had everything a girl could have: kindness, admiration, bonbons, bouquets, the sense of exclusion from none of the privileges of the world she lived in, abundant opportunity for dancing, plenty of new dresses, the London Spectator, the latest publications, the music of Gounod, the poetry of Browning, the prose of George Eliot.</p><p>These things now, as memory played over them, resolved themselves into a multitude of scenes and figures. Forgotten things came back to her; many others, which she had lately thought of great moment, dropped out of sight. The result was kaleidoscopic, but the movement of the instrument was checked at last by the servant's coming in with the name of a gentleman. The name of the gentleman was Caspar Goodwood; he was a straight young man from Boston, who had known Miss Archer for the last twelvemonth and who, thinking her the most beautiful young woman of her time, had pronounced the time, according to the rule I have hinted at, a foolish period of history. He sometimes wrote to her and had within a week or two written from New York. She had thought it very possible he would come in--had indeed all the rainy day been vaguely expecting him. Now that she learned he was there, nevertheless, she felt no eagerness to receive him. He was the finest young man she had ever seen, was indeed quite a splendid young man; he inspired her with a sentiment of high, of rare respect. She had never felt equally moved to it by any other person. He was supposed by the world in general to wish to marry her, but this of course was between themselves. It at least may be affirmed that he had travelled from New York to Albany expressly to see her; having learned in the former city, where he was spending a few days and where he had hoped to find her, that she was still at the State capital. Isabel delayed for some minutes to go to him; she moved about the room with a new sense of complications. But at last she presented herself and found him standing near the lamp. He was tall, strong and somewhat stiff; he was also lean and brown. He was not romantically, he was much rather obscurely, handsome; but his physiognomy had an air of requesting your attention, which it rewarded according to the charm you found in blue eyes of remarkable fixedness, the eyes of a complexion other than his own, and a jaw of the somewhat angular mould which is supposed to bespeak resolution. Isabel said to herself that it bespoke resolution to-night; in spite of which, in half an hour, Caspar Goodwood, who had arrived hopeful as well as resolute, took his way back to his lodging with the feeling of a man defeated. He was not, it may be added, a man weakly to accept defeat.<br /></p></span><span id = 954 ><p>Ralph Touchett was a philosopher, but nevertheless he knocked at hismother's door (at a quarter to seven) with a good deal of eagerness.Even philosophers have their preferences, and it must be admitted thatof his progenitors his father ministered most to his sense of thesweetness of filial dependence. His father, as he had often said tohimself, was the more motherly; his mother, on the other hand, waspaternal, and even, according to the slang of the day, gubernatorial.She was nevertheless very fond of her only child and had alwaysinsisted on his spending three months of the year with her. Ralphrendered perfect justice to her affection and knew that in her thoughtsand her thoroughly arranged and servanted life his turn always cameafter the other nearest subjects of her solicitude, the variouspunctualities of performance of the workers of her will. He found hercompletely dressed for dinner, but she embraced her boy with her glovedhands and made him sit on the sofa beside her. She enquiredscrupulously about her husband's health and about the young man's own,and, receiving no very brilliant account of either, remarked that shewas more than ever convinced of her wisdom in not exposing herself tothe English climate. In this case she also might have given way. Ralphsmiled at the idea of his mother's giving way, but made no point ofreminding her that his own infirmity was not the result of the Englishclimate, from which he absented himself for a considerable part of eachyear.</p><p>He had been a very small boy when his father, Daniel Tracy Touchett,a native of Rutland, in the State of Vermont, came to England assubordinate partner in a banking-house where some ten years later hegained preponderant control. Daniel Touchett saw before him a life-longresidence in his adopted country, of which, from the first, he took asimple, sane and accommodating view. But, as he said to himself, he hadno intention of disamericanising, nor had he a desire to teach his onlyson any such subtle art. It had been for himself so very soluble aproblem to live in England assimilated yet unconverted that it seemedto him equally simple his lawful heir should after his death carry onthe grey old bank in the white American light. He was at pains tointensify this light, however, by sending the boy home for hiseducation. Ralph spent several terms at an American school and took adegree at an American university, after which, as he struck his fatheron his return as even redundantly native, he was placed for some threeyears in residence at Oxford. Oxford swallowed up Harvard, and Ralphbecame at last English enough. His outward conformity to the mannersthat surrounded him was none the less the mask of a mind that greatlyenjoyed its independence, on which nothing long imposed itself, andwhich, naturally inclined to adventure and irony, indulged in aboundless liberty of appreciation. He began with being a young man ofpromise; at Oxford he distinguished himself, to his father's ineffablesatisfaction, and the people about him said it was a thousand pities soclever a fellow should be shut out from a career. He might have had acareer by returning to his own country (though this point is shroudedin uncertainty) and even if Mr. Touchett had been willing to part withhim (which was not the case) it would have gone hard with him to put awatery waste permanently between himself and the old man whom heregarded as his best friend. Ralph was not only fond of his father, headmired him--he enjoyed the opportunity of observing him. DanielTouchett, to his perception, was a man of genius, and though he himselfhad no aptitude for the banking mystery he made a point of learningenough of it to measure the great figure his father had played. It wasnot this, however, he mainly relished; it was the fine ivory surface,polished as by the English air, that the old man had opposed topossibilities of penetration. Daniel Touchett had been neither atHarvard nor at Oxford, and it was his own fault if he had placed in hisson's hands the key to modern criticism. Ralph, whose head was full ofideas which his father had never guessed, had a high esteem for thelatter's originality. Americans, rightly or wrongly, are commended forthe ease with which they adapt themselves to foreign conditions; butMr. Touchett had made of the very limits of his pliancy half the groundof his general success. He had retained in their freshness most of hismarks of primary pressure; his tone, as his son always noted withpleasure, was that of the more luxuriant parts of New England. At theend of his life he had become, on his own ground, as mellow as he wasrich; he combined consummate shrewdness with the dispositionsuperficially to fraternise, and his "social position," on which he hadnever wasted a care, had the firm perfection of an unthumbed fruit. Itwas perhaps his want of imagination and of what is called the historicconsciousness; but to many of the impressions usually made by Englishlife upon the cultivated stranger his sense was completely closed.There were certain differences he had never perceived, certain habitshe had never formed, certain obscurities he had never sounded. Asregards these latter, on the day he had sounded them his son would havethought less well of him.</p><p>Ralph, on leaving Oxford, had spent a couple of years in travelling;after which he had found himself perched on a high stool in hisfather's bank. The responsibility and honour of such positions is not,I believe, measured by the height of the stool, which depends uponother considerations: Ralph, indeed, who had very long legs, was fondof standing, and even of walking about, at his work. To this exercise,however, he was obliged to devote but a limited period, for at the endof some eighteen months he had become aware of his being seriously outof health. He had caught a violent cold, which fixed itself on hislungs and threw them into dire confusion. He had to give up work andapply, to the letter, the sorry injunction to take care of himself. Atfirst he slighted the task; it appeared to him it was not himself inthe least he was taking care of, but an uninteresting and uninterestedperson with whom he had nothing in common. This person, however,improved on acquaintance, and Ralph grew at last to have a certaingrudging tolerance, even an undemonstrative respect, for him.Misfortune makes strange bedfellows, and our young man, feeling that hehad something at stake in the matter-- it usually struck him as hisreputation for ordinary wit-- devoted to his graceless charge an amountof attention of which note was duly taken and which had at least theeffect of keeping the poor fellow alive. One of his lungs began toheal, the other promised to follow its example, and he was assured hemight outweather a dozen winters if he would betake himself to thoseclimates in which consumptives chiefly congregate. As he had grownextremely fond of London, he cursed the flatness of exile: but at thesame time that he cursed he conformed, and gradually, when he found hissensitive organ grateful even for grim favours, he conferred them witha lighter hand. He wintered abroad, as the phrase is; basked in thesun, stopped at home when the wind blew, went to bed when it rained,and once or twice, when it had snowed overnight, almost never got upagain.</p><p>A secret hoard of indifference--like a thick cake a fond old nursemight have slipped into his first school outfit--came to his aid andhelped to reconcile him to sacrifice; since at the best he was too illfor aught but that arduous game. As he said to himself, there wasreally nothing he had wanted very much to do, so that he had at leastnot renounced the field of valour. At present, however, the fragranceof forbidden fruit seemed occasionally to float past him and remind himthat the finest of pleasures is the rush of action. Living as he nowlived was like reading a good book in a poor translation--a meagreentertainment for a young man who felt that he might have been anexcellent linguist. He had good winters and poor winters, and while theformer lasted he was sometimes the sport of a vision of virtualrecovery. But this vision was dispelled some three years before theoccurrence of the incidents with which this history opens: he had onthat occasion remained later than usual in England and had beenovertaken by bad weather before reaching Algiers. He arrived more deadthan alive and lay there for several weeks between life and death. Hisconvalescence was a miracle, but the first use he made of it was toassure himself that such miracles happen but once. He said to himselfthat his hour was in sight and that it behoved him to keep his eyesupon it, yet that it was also open to him to spend the interval asagreeably as might be consistent with such a preoccupation. With theprospect of losing them the simple use of his faculties became anexquisite pleasure; it seemed to him the joys of contemplation hadnever been sounded. He was far from the time when he had found it hardthat he should be obliged to give up the idea of distinguishinghimself; an idea none the less importunate for being vague and none theless delightful for having had to struggle in the same breast withbursts of inspiring self-criticism. His friends at present judged himmore cheerful, and attributed it to a theory, over which they shooktheir heads knowingly, that he would recover his health. His serenitywas but the array of wild flowers niched in his ruin.</p><p>It was very probably this sweet-tasting property of the observedthing in itself that was mainly concerned in Ralph's quickly-stirredinterest in the advent of a young lady who was evidently not insipid.If he was consideringly disposed, something told him, here wasoccupation enough for a succession of days. It may be added, in summaryfashion, that the imagination of loving--as distinguished from that ofbeing loved --had still a place in his reduced sketch. He had onlyforbidden himself the riot of expression. However, he shouldn't inspirehis cousin with a passion, nor would she be able, even should she try,to help him to one. "And now tell me about the young lady," he said tohis mother. "What do you mean to do with her?"</p><p>Mrs. Touchett was prompt. "I mean to ask your father to invite her to stay three or four weeks at Gardencourt."</p><p>"You needn't stand on any such ceremony as that," said Ralph. "My father will ask her as a matter of course."</p><p>"I don't know about that. She's my niece; she's not his."</p><p>"Good Lord, dear mother; what a sense of property! That's all themore reason for his asking her. But after that--I mean after threemonths (for its absurd asking the poor girl to remain but for three orfour paltry weeks)--what do you mean to do with her?"</p><p>"I mean to take her to Paris. I mean to get her clothing."</p><p>"Ah yes, that's of course. But independently of that?"</p><p>"I shall invite her to spend the autumn with me in Florence."</p><p>"You don't rise above detail, dear mother," said Ralph. "I should like to know what you mean to do with her in a general way."</p><p>"My duty!" Mrs. Touchett declared. "I suppose you pity her very much," she added.</p><p>"No, I don't think I pity her. She doesn't strike me as invitingcompassion. I think I envy her. Before being sure, however, give me ahint of where you see your duty."</p><p>"In showing her four European countries--I shall leave her thechoice of two of them--and in giving her the opportunity of perfectingherself in French, which she already knows very well."</p><p>Ralph frowned a little. "That sounds rather dry--even allowing her the choice of two of the countries."</p><p>"If it's dry," said his mother with a laugh, "you can leave Isabel alone to water it! She is as good as a summer rain, any day."</p><p>"Do you mean she's a gifted being?"</p><p>"I don't know whether she's a gifted being, but she's a clevergirl--with a strong will and a high temper. She has no idea of beingbored."</p><p>"I can imagine that," said Ralph; and then he added abruptly: "How do you two get on?"</p><p>"Do you mean by that that I'm a bore? I don't think she finds meone. Some girls might, I know; but Isabel's too clever for that. Ithink I greatly amuse her. We get on because I understand her, I knowthe sort of girl she is. She's very frank, and I'm very frank: we knowjust what to expect of each other."</p><p>"Ah, dear mother," Ralph exclaimed, "one always knows what to expectof you! You've never surprised me but once, and that's to-day--inpresenting me with a pretty cousin whose existence I had neversuspected."</p><p>"Do you think her so very pretty?"</p><p>"Very pretty indeed; but I don't insist upon that. It's her generalair of being some one in particular that strikes me. Who is this rarecreature, and what is she? Where did you find her, and how did you makeher acquaintance?"</p><p>"I found her in an old house at Albany, sitting in a dreary room ona rainy day, reading a heavy book and boring herself to death. Shedidn't know she was bored, but when I left her no doubt of it sheseemed very grateful for the service. You may say I shouldn't haveenlightened he--I should have let her alone. There's a good deal inthat, but I acted conscientiously; I thought she was meant forsomething better. It occurred to me that it would be a kindness to takeher about and introduce her to the world. She thinks she knows a greatdeal of it--like most American girls; but like most American girlsshe's ridiculously mistaken. If you want to know, I thought she woulddo me credit. I like to be well thought of, and for a woman of my agethere's no greater convenience, in some ways, than an attractive niece.You know I had seen nothing of my sister's children for years; Idisapproved entirely of the father. But I always meant to do somethingfor them when he should have gone to his reward. I ascertained wherethey were to be found and, without any preliminaries, went andintroduced myself. There are two others of them, both of whom aremarried; but I saw only the elder, who has, by the way, a very uncivilhusband. The wife, whose name is Lily, jumped at the idea of my takingan interest in Isabel; she said it was just what her sisterneeded--that some one should take an interest in her. She spoke of heras you might speak of some young person of genius-- in want ofencouragement and patronage. It may be that Isabel's a genius; but inthat case I've not yet learned her special line. Mrs. Ludlow wasespecially keen about my taking her to Europe; they all regard Europeover there as a land of emigration, of rescue, a refuge for theirsuperfluous population. Isabel herself seemed very glad to come, andthe thing was easily arranged. There was a little difficulty about themoney-question, as she seemed averse to being under pecuniaryobligations. But she has a small income and she supposes herself to betravelling at her own expense."</p><p>Ralph had listened attentively to this judicious report, by whichhis interest in the subject of it was not impaired. "Ah, if she's agenius," he said, "we must find out her special line. Is it by chancefor flirting?"</p><p>"I don't think so. You may suspect that at first, but you'll bewrong. You won't, I think, in anyway, be easily right about her."</p><p>"Warburton's wrong then!" Ralph rejoicingly exclaimed. "He flatters himself he has made that discovery."</p><p>His mother shook her head. "Lord Warburton won't understand her. He needn't try."</p><p>"He's very intelligent," said Ralph; "but it's right he should be puzzled once in a while."</p><p>"Isabel will enjoy puzzling a lord," Mrs. Touchett remarked.</p><p>Her son frowned a little. What does she know about lords?"</p><p>"Nothing at all: that will puzzle him all the more."</p><p>Ralph greeted these words with a laugh and looked out of the window. Then, "Are you not going down to see my father?" he asked.</p><p>"At a quarter to eight," said Mrs. Touchett.</p><p>Her son looked at his watch. "You've another quarter of an hourthen. Tell me some more about Isabel." After which, as Mrs. Touchettdeclined his invitation, declaring that he must find out for himself,"Well," he pursued, "she'll certainly do you credit. But won't she alsogive you trouble?"</p><p>"I hope not; but if she does I shall not shrink from it. I never do that."</p><p>"She strikes me as very natural," said Ralph.</p><p>"Natural people are not the most trouble."</p><p>"No," said Ralph; "you yourself are a proof of that. You'reextremely natural, and I'm sure you have never troubled any one. Ittakes trouble to do that. But tell me this; it just occurs to me. IsIsabel capable of making herself disagreeable?"</p><p>"Ah," cried his mother, "you ask too many questions! Find that out for yourself."</p><p>His questions, however, were not exhausted. "All this time," he said, "you've not told me what you intend to do with her."</p><p>"Do with her? You talk as if she were a yard of calico. I shall doabsolutely nothing with her, and she herself will do everything shechooses. She gave me notice of that."</p><p>"What you meant then, in your telegram, was that her character's independent."</p><p>"I never know what I mean in my telegrams--especially those I sendfrom America. Clearness is too expensive. Come down to your father."</p><p>"It's not yet a quarter to eight," said Ralph.</p><p>"I must allow for his impatience," Mrs. Touchett answered. Ralphknew what to think of his father's impatience; but, making norejoinder, he offered his mother his arm. This put it in his power, asthey descended together, to stop her a moment on the middle landing ofthe staircase--the broad, low, wide-armed staircase of time-blackenedoak which was one of the most striking features of Gardencourt. "You'veno plan of marrying her?" he smiled.</p><p>"Marrying her? I should be sorry to play her such a trick! But apartfrom that, she's perfectly able to marry herself. She has everyfacility."</p><p>"Do you mean to say she has a husband picked out?"</p><p>"I don't know about a husband, but there's a young man in Boston--!"</p><p>Ralph went on; he had no desire to hear about the young man in Boston. "As my father says, they're always engaged!"</p><p>His mother had told him that he must satisfy his curiosity at thesource, and it soon became evident he should not want for occasion. Hehad a good deal of talk with his young kinswoman when the two had beenleft together in the drawing-room. Lord Warburton, who had ridden overfrom his own house, some ten miles distant, remounted and took hisdeparture before dinner; and an hour after this meal was ended Mr. andMrs. Touchett, who appeared to have quite emptied the measure of theirforms, withdrew, under the valid pretext of fatigue, to theirrespective apartments. The young man spent an hour with his cousin;though she had been travelling half the day she appeared in no degreespent. She was really tired; she knew it, and knew she should pay forit on the morrow; but it was her habit at this period to carryexhaustion to the furthest point and confess to it only whendissimulation broke down. A fine hypocrisy was for the presentpossible; she was interested; she was, as she said to herself, floated.She asked Ralph to show her the pictures; there were a great many inthe house, most of them of his own choosing. The best were arranged inan oaken gallery, of charming proportions, which had a sitting-room ateither end of it and which in the evening was usually lighted. Thelight was insufficient to show the pictures to advantage, and the visitmight have stood over to the morrow. This suggestion Ralph had venturedto make; but Isabel looked disappointed--smiling still, however--andsaid: "If you please I should like to see them just a little." She waseager, she knew she was eager and now seemed so; she couldn't help it."She doesn't take suggestions," Ralph said to himself; but he said itwithout irritation; her pressure amused and even pleased him. The lampswere on brackets, at intervals, and if the light was imperfect it wasgenial. It fell upon the vague squares of rich colour and on the fadedgilding of heavy frames; it made a sheen on the polished floor of thegallery. Ralph took a candlestick and moved about, pointing out thethings he liked; Isabel, inclining to one picture after another,indulged in little exclamations and murmurs. She was evidently a judge;she had a natural taste; he was struck with that. She took acandlestick herself and held it slowly here and there; she lifted ithigh, and as she did so he found himself pausing in the middle of theplace and bending his eyes much less upon the pictures than on herpresence. He lost nothing, in truth, by these wandering glances, forshe was better worth looking at than most works of art. She wasundeniably spare, and ponderably light, and proveably tall; when peoplehad wished to distinguish her from the other two Miss Archers they hadalways called her the willowy one. Her hair, which was dark even toblackness, had been an object of envy to many women; her light greyeyes, a little too firm perhaps in her graver moments, had anenchanting range of concession. They walked slowly up one side of thegallery and down the other, and then she said: "Well, now I know morethan I did when I began!"</p><p>"You apparently have a great passion for knowledge," her cousin returned.</p><p>"I think I have; most girls are horridly ignorant."</p><p>"You strike me as different from most girls."</p><p>"Ah, some of them would--but the way they're talked to!" murmuredIsabel, who preferred not to dilate just yet on herself. Then in amoment, to change the subject, "Please tell me--isn't there a ghost?"she went on.</p><p>"A ghost?"</p><p>"A castle-spectre, a thing that appears. We call them ghosts in America."</p><p>"So we do here, when we see them."</p><p>"You do see them then? You ought to, in this romantic old house."</p><p>"It's not a romantic old house," said Ralph. "You'll be disappointedif you count on that. It's a dismally prosaic one; there's no romancehere but what you may have brought with you."</p><p>"I've brought a great deal; but it seems to me I've brought it to the right place."</p><p>"To keep it out of harm, certainly; nothing will ever happen to it here, between my father and me."</p><p>Isabel looked at him a moment. "Is there never any one here but your father and you?"</p><p>"My mother, of course."</p><p>"Oh, I know your mother; she's not romantic. Haven't you other people?"</p><p>"Very few."</p><p>"I'm sorry for that; I like so much to see people."</p><p>"Oh, we'll invite all the county to amuse you," said Ralph.</p><p>"Now you're making fun of me," the girl answered rather gravely. "Who was the gentleman on the lawn when I arrived?"</p><p>"A county neighbour; he doesn't come very often."</p><p>"I'm sorry for that; I liked him," said Isabel.</p><p>"Why, it seemed to me that you barely spoke to him," Ralph objected.</p><p>"Never mind, I like him all the same. I like your father too, immensely."</p><p>"You can't do better than that. He's the dearest of the dear."</p><p>"I'm so sorry he is ill," said Isabel.</p><p>"You must help me to nurse him; you ought to be a good nurse."</p><p>"I don't think I am; I've been told I'm not; I'm said to have toomany theories. But you haven't told me about the ghost," she added.</p><p>Ralph, however, gave no heed to this observation. "You like myfather and you like Lord Warburton. I infer also that you like mymother."</p><p>"I like your mother very much, because--because--" And Isabel foundherself attempting to assign a reason for her affection for Mrs.Touchett.</p><p>"Ah, we never know why!" said her companion, laughing.</p><p>"I always know why," the girl answered. "It's because she doesn'texpect one to like her. She doesn't care whether one does or not."</p><p>"So you adore her--out of perversity? Well, I take greatly after my mother," said Ralph.</p><p>"I don't believe you do at all. You wish people to like you, and you try to make them do it."</p><p>"Good heavens, how you see through one!" he cried with a dismay that was not altogether jocular.</p><p>"But I like you all the same," his cousin went on. "The way to clinch the matter will be to show me the ghost."</p><p>Ralph shook his head sadly. "I might show it to you, but you'd neversee it. The privilege isn't given to every one; it's not enviable. Ithas never been seen by a young, happy, innocent person like you. Youmust have suffered first, have suffered greatly, have gained somemiserable knowledge. In that way your eyes are opened to it. I saw itlong ago," said Ralph.</p><p>"I told you just now I'm very fond of knowledge," Isabel answered.</p><p>"Yes, of happy knowledge--of pleasant knowledge. But you haven'tsuffered, and you're not made to suffer. I hope you'll never see theghost!"</p><p>She had listened to him attentively, with a smile on her lips, butwith a certain gravity in her eyes. Charming as he found her, she hadstruck him as rather presumptuous--indeed it was a part of her charm;and he wondered what she would say. "I'm not afraid, you know," shesaid: which seemed quite presumptuous enough.</p><p>"You're not afraid of suffering?"</p><p>"Yes, I'm afraid of suffering. But I'm not afraid of ghosts. And I think people suffer too easily," she added.</p><p>"I don't believe you do," said Ralph, looking at her with his hands in his pockets.</p><p>"I don't think that's a fault," she answered. "It's not absolutely necessary to suffer; we were not made for that."</p><p>"You were not, certainly."</p><p>"I'm not speaking of myself." And she wandered off a little.</p><p>"No, it isn't a fault," said her cousin. "It's a merit to be strong."</p><p>"Only, if you don't suffer they call you hard," Isabel remarked.</p><p>They passed out of the smaller drawing-room, into which they hadreturned from the gallery, and paused in the hall, at the foot of thestaircase. Here Ralph presented his companion with her bedroom candle,which he had taken from a niche. "Never mind what they call you. Whenyou do suffer they call you an idiot. The great point's to be as happyas possible."</p><p>She looked at him a little; she had taken her candle and placed herfoot on the oaken stair. "Well," she said, "that's what I came toEurope for, to be as happy as possible. Good-night."</p><p>"Good-night! I wish you all success, and shall be very glad to contribute to it!"</p><p>She turned away, and he watched her as she slowly ascended. Then,with his hands always in his pockets, he went back to the emptydrawing-room.</p></span><span id = 955 ><p>Isabel Archer was a young person of many theories; her imaginationwas remarkably active. It had been her fortune to possess a finer mindthan most of the persons among whom her lot was cast; to have a largerperception of surrounding facts and to care for knowledge that wastinged with the unfamiliar. It is true that among her contemporariesshe passed for a young woman of extraordinary profundity; for theseexcellent people never withheld their admiration from a reach ofintellect of which they themselves were not conscious, and spoke ofIsabel as a prodigy of learning, a creature reported to have read theclassic authors --in translations. Her paternal aunt, Mrs. Varian, oncespread the rumour that Isabel was writing a book--Mrs. Varian having areverence for books, and averred that the girl would distinguishherself in print. Mrs. Varian thought highly of literature, for whichshe entertained that esteem that is connected with a sense ofprivation. Her own large house, remarkable for its assortment of mosaictables and decorated ceilings, was unfurnished with a library, and inthe way of printed volumes contained nothing but half a dozen novels inpaper on a shelf in the apartment of one of the Miss Varians.Practically, Mrs. Varian's acquaintance with literature was confined toThe New York Interviewer; as she very justly said, after you had readthe Interviewer you had lost all faith in culture. Her tendency, withthis, was rather to keep the Interviewer out of the way of herdaughters; she was determined to bring them up properly, and they readnothing at all. Her impression with regard to Isabel's labours wasquite illusory; the girl had never attempted to write a book and had nodesire for the laurels of authorship. She had no talent for expressionand too little of the consciousness of genius; she only had a generalidea that people were right when they treated her as if she were rathersuperior. Whether or no she were superior, people were right inadmiring her if they thought her so; for it seemed to her often thather mind moved more quickly than theirs, and this encouraged animpatience that might easily be confounded with superiority. It may beaffirmed without delay that Isabel was probably very liable to the sinof self-esteem; she often surveyed with complacency the field of herown nature; she was in the habit of taking for granted, on scantyevidence, that she was right; she treated herself to occasions ofhomage. Meanwhile her errors and delusions were frequently such as abiographer interested in preserving the dignity of his subject mustshrink from specifying. Her thoughts were a tangle of vague outlineswhich had never been corrected by the judgement of people speaking withauthority. In matters of opinion she had had her own way, and it hadled her into a thousand ridiculous zigzags. At moments she discoveredshe was grotesquely wrong, and then she treated herself to a week ofpassionate humility. After this she held her head higher than everagain; for it was of no use, she had an unquenchable desire to thinkwell of herself. She had a theory that it was only under this provisionlife was worth living; that one should be one of the best, should beconscious of a fine organisation (she couldn't help knowing herorganisation was fine), should move in a realm of light, of naturalwisdom, of happy impulse, of inspiration gracefully chronic. It wasalmost as unnecessary to cultivate doubt of one's self as to cultivatedoubt of one's best friend: one should try to be one's own best friendand to give one's self, in this manner, distinguished company. The girlhad a certain nobleness of imagination which rendered her a good manyservices and played her a great many tricks. She spent half her time inthinking of beauty and bravery and magnanimity; she had a fixeddetermination to regard the world as a place of brightness, of freeexpansion, of irresistible action: she held it must be detestable to beafraid or ashamed. She had an infinite hope that she should never doanything wrong. She had resented so strongly, after discovering them,her mere errors of feeling (the discovery always made her tremble as ifshe had escaped from a trap which might have caught her and smotheredher) that the chance of inflicting a sensible injury upon anotherperson, presented only as a contingency, caused her at moments to holdher breath. That always struck her as the worst thing that could happento her. On the whole, reflectively, she was in no uncertainty about thethings that were wrong. She had no love of their look, but when shefixed them hard she recognised them. It was wrong to be mean, to bejealous, to be false, to be cruel; she had seen very little of the evilof the world, but she had seen women who lied and who tried to hurteach other. Seeing such things had quickened her high spirit; it seemedindecent not to scorn them. Of course the danger of a high spirit wasthe danger of inconsistency--the danger of keeping up the flag afterthe place has surrendered; a sort of behaviour so crooked as to bealmost a dishonour to the flag. But Isabel, who knew little of thesorts of artillery to which young women are exposed, flattered herselfthat such contradictions would never be noted in her own conduct. Herlife should always be in harmony with the most pleasing impression sheshould produce; she would be what she appeared, and she would appearwhat she was. Sometimes she went so far as to wish that she might findherself some day in a difficult position, so that she should have thepleasure of being as heroic as the occasion demanded. Altogether, withher meagre knowledge, her inflated ideals, her confidence at onceinnocent and dogmatic, her temper at once exacting and indulgent, hermixture of curiosity and fastidiousness, of vivacity and indifference,her desire to look very well and to be if possible even better, herdetermination to see, to try, to know, her combination of the delicate,desultory, flame-like spirit and the eager and personal creature ofconditions: she would be an easy victim of scientific criticism if shewere not intended to awaken on the reader's part an impulse more tenderand more purely expectant.</p><p>It was one of her theories that Isabel Archer was very fortunate inbeing independent, and that she ought to make some very enlightened useof that state. She never called it the state of solitude, much less ofsingleness; she thought such descriptions weak, and, besides, hersister Lily constantly urged her to come and abide. She had a friendwhose acquaintance she had made shortly before her father's death, whooffered so high an example of useful activity that Isabel alwaysthought of her as a model. Henrietta Stackpole had the advantage of anadmired ability; she was thoroughly launched in journalism, and herletters to the Interviewer, from Washington, Newport, the WhiteMountains and other places, were universally quoted. Isabel pronouncedthem with confidence "ephemeral," but she esteemed the courage, energyand good-humour of the writer, who, without parents and withoutproperty, had adopted three of the children of an infirm and widowedsister and was paying their school-bills out of the proceeds of herliterary labour. Henrietta was in the van of progress and had clear-cutviews on most subjects; her cherished desire had long been to come toEurope and write a series of letters to the Interviewer from theradical point of view--an enterprise the less difficult as she knewperfectly in advance what her opinions would be and to how manyobjections most European institutions lay open. When she heard thatIsabel was coming she wished to start at once; thinking, naturally,that it would be delightful the two should travel together. She hadbeen obliged, however, to postpone this enterprise. She thought Isabela glorious creature, and had spoken of her covertly in some of herletters, though she never mentioned the fact to her friend, who wouldnot have taken pleasure in it and was not a regular student of theInterviewer. Henrietta, for Isabel, was chiefly a proof that a womanmight suffice to herself and be happy. Her resources were of theobvious kind; but even if one had not the journalistic talent and agenius for guessing, as Henrietta said, what the public was going towant, one was not therefore to conclude that one had no vocation, nobeneficent aptitude of any sort, and resign one's self to beingfrivolous and hollow. Isabel was stoutly determined not to be hollow.If one should wait with the right patience one would find some happywork to one's hand. Of course, among her theories, this young lady wasnot without a collection of views on the subject of marriage. The firston the list was a conviction of the vulgarity of thinking too much ofit. From lapsing into eagerness on this point she earnestly prayed shemight be delivered; she held that a woman ought to be able to live toherself, in the absence of exceptional flimsiness, and that it wasperfectly possible to be happy without the society of a more or lesscoarse-minded person of another sex. The girl's prayer was verysufficiently answered; something pure and proud that there was inher--something cold and dry an unappreciated suitor with a taste foranalysis might have called it--had hitherto kept her from any greatvanity of conjecture on the article of possible husbands. Few of themen she saw seemed worth a ruinous expenditure, and it made her smileto think that one of them should present himself as an incentive tohope and a reward of patience. Deep in her soul--it was the deepestthing there--lay a belief that if a certain light should dawn she couldgive herself completely; but this image, on the whole, was tooformidable to be attractive. Isabel's thoughts hovered about it, butthey seldom rested on it long; after a little it ended in alarms. Itoften seemed to her that she thought too much about herself; you couldhave made her colour, any day in the year, by calling her a rankegoist. She was always planning out her development, desiring herperfection, observing her progress. Her nature had, in her conceit, acertain garden-like quality, a suggestion of perfume and murmuringboughs, of shady bowers and lengthening vistas, which made her feelthat introspection was, after all, an exercise in the open air, andthat a visit to the recesses of one's spirit was harmless when onereturned from it with a lapful of roses. But she was often remindedthat there were other gardens in the world than those of her remarkablesoul, and that there were moreover a great many places which were notgardens at all--only dusky pestiferous tracts, planted thick withugliness and misery. In the current of that repaid curiosity on whichshe had lately been floating, which had conveyed her to this beautifulold England and might carry her much further still, she often checkedherself with the thought of the thousands of people who were less happythan herself--a thought which for the moment made her fine, fullconsciousness appear a kind of immodesty. What should one do with themisery of the world in a scheme of the agreeable for one's self? Itmust be confessed that this question never held her long. She was tooyoung, too impatient to live, too unacquainted with pain. She alwaysreturned to her theory that a young woman whom after all every onethought clever should begin by getting a general impression of life.This impression was necessary to prevent mistakes, and after it shouldbe secured she might make the unfortunate condition of others a subjectof special attention.</p><p>England was a revelation to her, and she found herself as divertedas a child at a pantomime. In her infantine excursions to Europe shehad seen only the Continent, and seen it from the nursery window;Paris, not London, was her father's Mecca, and into many of hisinterests there his children had naturally not entered. The images ofthat time moreover had grown faint and remote, and the old-worldquality in everything that she now saw had all the charm ofstrangeness. Her uncle's house seemed a picture made real; norefinement of the agreeable was lost upon Isabel; the rich perfectionof Gardencourt at once revealed a world and gratified a need. Thelarge, low rooms, with brown ceilings and dusky corners, the deepembrasures and curious casements, the quiet light on dark, polishedpanels, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always peeping in, thesense of well-ordered privacy in the centre of a "property"--a placewhere sounds were felicitously accidental, where the tread was muffedby the earth itself and in the thick mild air all friction dropped outof contact and all shrillness out of talk--these things were much tothe taste of our young lady, whose taste played a considerable part inher emotions. She formed a fast friendship with her uncle, and oftensat by his chair when he had had it moved out to the lawn. He passedhours in the open air, sitting with folded hands like a placid, homelyhousehold god, a god of service, who had done his work and received hiswages and was trying to grow used to weeks and months made up only ofoff-days. Isabel amused him more than she suspected--the effect sheproduced upon people was often different from what she supposed--and hefrequently gave himself the pleasure of making her chatter. It was bythis term that he qualified her conversation, which had much of the"point" observable in that of the young ladies of her country, to whomthe ear of the world is more directly presented than to their sistersin other lands. Like the mass of American girls Isabel had beenencouraged to express herself; her remarks had been attended to; shehad been expected to have emotions and opinions. Many of her opinionshad doubtless but a slender value, many of her emotions passed away inthe utterance; but they had left a trace in giving her the habit ofseeming at least to feel and think, and in imparting moreover to herwords when she was really moved that prompt vividness which so manypeople had regarded as a sign of superiority. Mr. Touchett used tothink that she reminded him of his wife when his wife was in her teens.It was because she was fresh and natural and quick to understand, tospeak--so many characteristics of her niece--that he had fallen in lovewith Mrs. Touchett. He never expressed this analogy to the girlherself, however; for if Mrs. Touchett had once been like Isabel,Isabel was not at all like Mrs. Touchett. The old man was full ofkindness for her; it was a long time, as he said, since they had hadany young life in the house; and our rustling, quickly-moving,clear-voiced heroine was as agreeable to his sense as the sound offlowing water. He wanted to do something for her and wished she wouldask it of him. She would ask nothing but questions; it is true that ofthese she asked a quantity. Her uncle had a great fund of answers,though her pressure sometimes came in forms that puzzled him. Shequestioned him immensely about England, about the British constitution,the English character, the state of politics, the manners and customsof the royal family, the peculiarities of the aristocracy, the way ofliving and thinking of his neighbours; and in begging to be enlightenedon these points she usually enquired whether they corresponded with thedescriptions in the books. The old man always looked at her a littlewith his fine dry smile while he smoothed down the shawl spread acrosshis legs.</p><p>"The books?" he once said; "well, I don't know much about the books.You must ask Ralph about that. I've always ascertained for myself--gotmy information in the natural form. I never asked many questions even;I just kept quiet and took notice. Of course I've had very goodopportunities--better than what a young lady would naturally have. I'mof an inquisitive disposition, though you mightn't think it if you wereto watch me: however much you might watch me I should be watching youmore. I've been watching these people for upwards of thirty-five years,and I don't hesitate to say that I've acquired considerableinformation. It's a very fine country on the whole--finer perhaps thanwhat we give it credit for on the other side. Several improvements Ishould like to see introduced; but the necessity of them doesn't seemto be generally felt as yet. When the necessity of a thing is generallyfelt they usually manage to accomplish it; but they seem to feel prettycomfortable about waiting till then. I certainly feel more at homeamong them than I expected to when I first came over; I suppose it'sbecause I've had a considerable degree of success. When you'resuccessful you naturally feel more at home."</p><p>"Do you suppose that if I'm successful I shall feel at home?" Isabel asked.</p><p>"I should think it very probable, and you certainly will besuccessful. They like American young ladies very much over here; theyshow them a great deal of kindness. But you mustn't feel too much athome, you know."</p><p>"Oh, I'm by no means sure it will satisfy me," Isabel judiciallyemphasised. "I like the place very much, but I'm not sure I shall likethe people."</p><p>"The people are very good people; especially if you like them."</p><p>"I've no doubt they're good," Isabel rejoined; "but are theypleasant in society? They won't rob me nor beat me; but will they makethemselves agreeable to me? That's what I like people to do. I don'thesitate to say so, because I always appreciate it. I don't believethey're very nice to girls; they're not nice to them in the novels."</p><p>"I don't know about the novels," said Mr. Touchett. "I believe thenovels have a great deal but I don't suppose they're very accurate. Weonce had a lady who wrote novels staying here; she was a friend ofRalph's and he asked her down. She was very positive, quite up toeverything; but she was not the sort of person you could depend on forevidence. Too free a fancy--I suppose that was it. She afterwardspublished a work of fiction in which she was understood to have given arepresentation-- something in the nature of a caricature, as you mightsay--of my unworthy self. I didn't read it, but Ralph just handed methe book with the principal passages marked. It was understood to be adescription of my conversation; American peculiarities, nasal twang,Yankee notions, stars and stripes. Well, it was not at all accurate;she couldn't have listened very attentively. I had no objection to hergiving a report of my conversation, if she liked but I didn't like theidea that she hadn't taken the trouble to listen to it. Of course Italk like an American--I can't talk like a Hottentot. However I talk,I've made them understand me pretty well over here. But I don't talklike the old gentleman in that lady's novel. He wasn't an American; wewouldn't have him over there at any price. I just mention that fact toshow you that they're not always accurate. Of course, as I've nodaughters, and as Mrs. Touchett resides in Florence, I haven't had muchchance to notice about the young ladies. It sometimes appears as if theyoung women in the lower class were not very well treated; but I guesstheir position is better in the upper and even to some extent in themiddle."</p><p>"Gracious," Isabel exclaimed; "how many classes have they? About fifty, I suppose."</p><p>"Well, I don't know that I ever counted them. I never took muchnotice of the classes. That's the advantage of being an American here;you don't belong to any class."</p><p>"I hope so," said Isabel. "Imagine one's belonging to an English class!"</p><p>"Well, I guess some of them are pretty comfortable--especiallytowards the top. But for me there are only two classes: the people Itrust and the people I don't. Of those two, my dear Isabel, you belongto the first."</p><p>"I'm much obliged to you," said the girl quickly. Her way of takingcompliments seemed sometimes rather dry; she got rid of them as rapidlyas possible. But as regards this she was sometimes misjudged; she wasthought insensible to them, whereas in fact she was simply unwilling toshow how infinitely they pleased her. To show that was to show toomuch. "I'm sure the English are very conventional," she added.</p><p>"They've got everything pretty well fixed," Mr. Touchett admitted."It's all settled beforehand--they don't leave it to the last moment."</p><p>"I don't like to have everything settled beforehand," said the girl. "I like more unexpectedness."</p><p>Her uncle seemed amused at her distinctness of preference. "Well,it's settled beforehand that you'll have great success," he rejoined."I suppose you'll like that."</p><p>"I shall not have success if they're too stupidly conventional. I'mnot in the least stupidly conventional. I'm just the contrary. That'swhat they won't like."</p><p>"No, no, you're all wrong," said the old man. "You can't tell whatthey'll like. They're very inconsistent; that's their principalinterest."</p><p>"Ah well," said Isabel, standing before her uncle with her handsclasped about the belt of her black dress and looking up and down thelawn--"that will suit me perfectly!"</p></span><span id = 956 ><p>The two amused themselves, time and again, with talking of theattitude of the British public as if the young lady had been in aposition to appeal to it; but in fact the British public remained forthe present profoundly indifferent to Miss Isabel Archer, whose fortunehad dropped her, as her cousin said, into the dullest house in England.Her gouty uncle received very little company, and Mrs. Touchett, nothaving cultivated relations with her husband's neighbours, was notwarranted in expecting visits from them. She had, however, a peculiartaste; she liked to receive cards. For what is usually called socialintercourse she had very little relish; but nothing pleased her morethan to find her hall-table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolicpasteboard. She flattered herself that she was a very just woman, andhad mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got fornothing. She had played no social part as mistress of Gardencourt, andit was not to be supposed that, in the surrounding country, a minuteaccount should be kept of her comings and goings. But it is by no meanscertain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice wastaken of them and that her failure (really very gratuitous) to makeherself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with theacrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country. Isabelpresently found herself in the singular situation of defending theBritish constitution against her aunt; Mrs. Touchett having formed thehabit of sticking pins into this venerable instrument. Isabel alwaysfelt an impulse to pull out the pins; not that she imagined theyinflicted any damage on the tough old parchment, but because it seemedto her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness. She was verycritical herself-- it was incidental to her age, her sex and hernationality; but she was very sentimental as well, and there wassomething in Mrs. Touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountainsflowing.</p><p>"Now what's your point of view?" she asked of her aunt. "When youcriticise everything here you should have a point of view. Yoursdoesn't seem to be American--you thought everything over there sodisagreeable. When I criticise I have mine; it's thoroughly American!"</p><p>"My dear young lady," said Mrs. Touchett, "there are as many pointsof view in the world as there are people of sense to take them. You maysay that doesn't make them very numerous! American? Never in the world;that's shockingly narrow. My point of view, thank God, is personal!"</p><p>Isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted; it was atolerable description of her own manner of judging, but it would nothave sounded well for her to say so. On the lips of a person lessadvanced in life and less enlightened by experience than Mrs. Touchettsuch a declaration would savour of immodesty, even of arrogance. Sherisked it nevertheless in talking with Ralph, with whom she talked agreat deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave alarge licence to extravagance. Her cousin used, as the phrase is, tochaff her; he very soon established with her a reputation for treatingeverything as a joke, and he was not a man to neglect the privilegessuch a reputation conferred. She accused him of an odious want ofseriousness, of laughing at all things, beginning with himself. Suchslender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon hisfather; for the rest, he exercised his wit indifferently upon hisfather's son, this gentleman's weak lungs, his useless life, hisfantastic mother, his friends (Lord Warburton in especial), hisadopted, and his native country, his charming new-found cousin. "I keepa band of music in my ante-room," he said once to her. "It has ordersto play without stopping; it renders me two excellent services. Itkeeps the sounds of the world from reaching the private apartments, andit makes the world think that dancing's going on within." It wasdance-music indeed that you usually heard when you came within ear-shotof Ralph's band; the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air.Isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling; shewould have liked to pass through the ante-room, as her cousin calledit, and enter the private apartments. It mattered little that he hadassured her they were a very dismal place; she would have been glad toundertake to sweep them and set them in order. It was buthalf-hospitality to let her remain outside; to punish him for whichIsabel administered innumerable taps with the ferule of her straightyoung wit. It must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extentin self-defence, for her cousin amused himself with calling her"Columbia" and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched.He drew a caricature of her in which she was represented as a verypretty young woman dressed, on the lines of the prevailing fashion, inthe folds of the national banner. Isabel's chief dread in life at thisperiod of her development was that she should appear narrow-minded;what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so. Butshe nevertheless made no scruple of abounding in her cousin's sense andpretending to sigh for the charms of her native land. She would be asAmerican as it pleased him to regard her, and if he chose to laugh ather she would give him plenty of occupation. She defended Englandagainst his mother, but when Ralph sang its praises on purpose, as shesaid, to work her up, she found herself able to differ from him on avariety of points. In fact, the quality of this small ripe countryseemed as sweet to her as the taste of an October pear; and hersatisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her totake her cousin's chaff and return it in kind. If her good-humourflagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill-used, butbecause she suddenly felt sorry for Ralph. It seemed to her he wastalking as a blind and had little heart in what he said. "I don't knowwhat's the matter with you," she observed to him once; "but I suspectyou're a great humbug."</p><p>"That's your privilege," Ralph answered, who had not been used to being so crudely addressed.</p><p>"I don't know what you care for; I don't think you care foranything. You don't really care for England when you praise it; youdon't care for America even when you pretend to abuse it."</p><p>"I care for nothing but you, dear cousin," said Ralph.</p><p>"If I could believe even that, I should be very glad."</p><p>"Ah well, I should hope so!" the young man exclaimed.</p><p>Isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth.He thought a great deal about her; she was constantly present to hismind. At a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden tohim her sudden arrival, which promised nothing and was an open-handedgift of fate, had refreshed and quickened them, given them wings andsomething to fly for. Poor Ralph had been for many weeks steeped inmelancholy; his outlook, habitually sombre, lay under the shadow of adeeper cloud. He had grown anxious about his father, whose gout,hitherto confined to his legs, had begun to ascend into regions morevital. The old man had been gravely ill in the spring, and the doctorshad whispered to Ralph that another attack would be less easy to dealwith. Just now he appeared disburdened of pain, but Ralph could not ridhimself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy, who waswaiting to take him off his guard. If the manoeuvre should succeedthere would be little hope of any great resistance. Ralph had alwaystaken for granted that his father would survive him--that his own namewould be the first grimly called. The father and son had been closecompanions, and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of atasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man, whohad always and tacitly counted upon his elder's help in making the bestof a poor business. At the prospect of losing his great motive Ralphlost indeed his one inspiration. If they might die at the same time itwould be all very well; but without the encouragement of his father'ssociety he should barely have patience to await his own turn. He hadnot the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother;it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets. He bethought himselfof course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that,of the two, the active rather than the passive party should know thefelt wound; he remembered that the old man had always treated his ownforecast of an early end as a clever fallacy, which he should bedelighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first. But of thetwo triumphs, that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding ona while longer to a state of being which, with all abatements, heenjoyed, Ralph deemed it no sin to hope the latter might be vouchsafedto Mr. Touchett.</p><p>These were nice questions, but Isabel's arrival put a stop to hispuzzling over them. It even suggested there might be a compensation forthe intolerable ennui of surviving his genial sire. He wondered whetherhe were harbouring "love" for this spontaneous young woman from Albany;but he judged that on the whole he was not. After he had known her fora week he quite made up his mind to this, and every day he felt alittle more sure. Lord Warburton had been right about her; she was areally interesting little figure. Ralph wondered how their neighbourhad found it out so soon; and then he said it was only another proof ofhis friend's high abilities, which he had always greatly admired. Ifhis cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him, Ralphwas conscious she was an entertainment of a high order. "A characterlike that," he said to himself-- "a real little passionate force to seeat play is the finest thing in nature. It's finer than the finest workof art--than a Greek bas-relief, than a great Titian, than a Gothiccathedral. It's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had leastlooked for it. I had never been more blue, more bored, than for a weekbefore she came; I had never expected less that anything pleasant wouldhappen. Suddenly I receive a Titian, by the post, to hang on my wall--aGreek bas-relief to stick over my chimney-piece. The key of a beautifuledifice is thrust into my hand, and I'm told to walk in and admire. Mypoor boy, you've been sadly ungrateful, and now you had better keepvery quiet and never grumble again." The sentiment of these reflexionswas very just; but it was not exactly true that Ralph Touchett had hada key put into his hand. His cousin was a very brilliant girl, whowould take, as he said, a good deal of knowing; but she needed theknowing, and his attitude with regard to her, though it wascontemplative and critical, was not judicial. He surveyed the edificefrom the outside and admired it greatly; he looked in at the windowsand received an impression of proportions equally fair. But he feltthat he saw it only by glimpses and that he had not yet stood under theroof. The door was fastened, and though he had keys in his pocket hehad a conviction that none of them would fit. She was intelligent andgenerous; it was a fine free nature; but what was she going to do withherself? This question was irregular, for with most women one had nooccasion to ask it. Most women did with themselves nothing at all; theywaited, in attitudes more or less gracefully passive, for a man to comethat way and furnish them with a destiny. Isabel's originality was thatshe gave one an impression of having intentions of her own. "Whenevershe executes them," said Ralph, "may I be there to see!"</p><p>It devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place. Mr.Touchett was confined to his chair, and his wife's position was that ofrather a grim visitor; so that in the line of conduct that openeditself to Ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed. He wasnot a great walker, but he strolled about the grounds with hiscousin--a pastime for which the weather remained favourable with apersistency not allowed for in Isabel's somewhat lugubrious previsionof the climate; and in the long afternoons, of which the length was butthe measure of her gratified eagerness, they took a boat on the river,the dear little river, as Isabel called it, where the opposite shoreseemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape; or drove overthe country in a phaeton--a low, capacious, thick-wheeled phaetonformerly much used by Mr. Touchett, but which he had now ceased toenjoy. Isabel enjoyed it largely and, handling the reins in a mannerwhich approved itself to the groom as "knowing," was never weary ofdriving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and bywaysfull of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find; pastcottages thatched and timbered, past ale-houses latticed and sanded,past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks, betweenhedgerows made thick by midsummer. When they reached home they usuallyfound tea had been served on the lawn and that Mrs. Touchett had notshrunk from the extremity of handing her husband his cup. But the twofor the most part sat silent; the old man with his head back and hiseyes closed, his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing thatappearance of rare profundity with which some ladies consider themovement of their needles.</p><p>One day, however, a visitor had arrived. The two young persons,after spending an hour on the river, strolled back to the house andperceived Lord Warburton sitting under the trees and engaged inconversation, of which even at a distance the desultory character wasappreciable, with Mrs. Touchett. He had driven over from his own placewith a portmanteau and had asked, as the father and son often invitedhim to do, for a dinner and a lodging. Isabel, seeing him for half anhour on the day of her arrival, had discovered in this brief space thatshe liked him; he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on herfine sense and she had thought of him several times. She had hoped sheshould see him again--hoped too that she should see a few others.Gardencourt was not dull; the place itself was sovereign, her uncle wasmore and more a sort of golden grandfather, and Ralph was unlike anycousin she had ever encountered--her idea of cousins having tended togloom. Then her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewedthat there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view. But Isabelhad need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature andthat her foremost hope in coming abroad had been that she should see agreat many people. When Ralph said to her, as he had done severaltimes, "I wonder you find this endurable; you ought to see some of theneighbours and some of our friends, because we have really got a few,though you would never suppose it"--when he offered to invite what hecalled a "lot of people" and make her acquainted with English society,she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurlherself into the fray. Little, however, for the present, had come ofhis offers, and it may be confided to the reader that if the young mandelayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour ofproviding for his companion by no means so severe as to requireextraneous help. Isabel had spoken to him very often about "specimens;"it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary; shehad given him to understand that she wished to see English societyillustrated by eminent cases.</p><p>"Well now, there's a specimen," he said to her as they walked up from the riverside and he recognised Lord Warburton.</p><p>"A specimen of what?" asked the girl.</p><p>"A specimen of an English gentleman."</p><p>"Do you mean they're all like him?"</p><p>"Oh no; they're not all like him."</p><p>"He's a favourable specimen then," said Isabel; "because I'm sure he's nice."</p><p>"Yes, he's very nice. And he's very fortunate."</p><p>The fortunate Lord Warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroineand hoped she was very well. "But I needn't ask that," he said, "sinceyou've been handling the oars."</p><p>"I've been rowing a little," Isabel answered; "but how should you know it?"</p><p>"Oh, I know he doesn't row; he's too lazy," said his lordship, indicating Ralph Touchett with a laugh.</p><p>"He has a good excuse for his laziness," Isabel rejoined, lowering her voice a little.</p><p>"Ah, he has a good excuse for everything!" cried Lord Warburton, still with his sonorous mirth.</p><p>"My excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well," saidRalph. "She does everything well. She touches nothing that she doesn'tadorn!"</p><p>"It makes one want to be touched, Miss Archer," Lord Warburton declared.</p><p>"Be touched in the right sense and you'll never look the worse forit," said Isabel, who, if it pleased her to hear it said that heraccomplishments were numerous, was happily able to reflect that suchcomplacency was not the indication of a feeble mind, inasmuch as therewere several things in which she excelled. Her desire to think well ofherself had at least the element of humility that it always needed tobe supported by proof.</p><p>Lord Warburton not only spent the night at Gardencourt, but he waspersuaded to remain over the second day; and when the second day wasended he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow. Duringthis period he addressed many of his remarks to Isabel, who acceptedthis evidence of his esteem with a very good grace. She found herselfliking him extremely; the first impression he had made on her had hadweight, but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarcefell short of seeing him--though quite without luridity--as a hero ofromance. She retired to rest with a sense of good fortune, with aquickened consciousness of possible felicities. "It's very nice to knowtwo such charming people as those," she said, meaning by "those" hercousin and her cousin's friend. It must be added moreover that anincident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good-humour tothe test. Mr. Touchett went to bed at half-past nine o'clock, but hiswife remained in the drawing-room with the other members of the party.She prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour, and then,rising, observed to Isabel that it was time they should bid thegentlemen good-night. Isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed; theoccasion wore, to her sense, a festive character, and feasts were notin the habit of terminating so early. So, without further thought, shereplied, very simply--</p><p>"Need I go, dear aunt? I'll come up in half an hour."</p><p>"It's impossible I should wait for you," Mrs. Touchett answered.</p><p>"Ah, you needn't wait! Ralph will light my candle," Isabel gaily engaged.</p><p>"I'll light your candle; do let me light your candle, Miss Archer!"Lord Warburton exclaimed. "Only I beg it shall not be before midnight."</p><p>Mrs. Touchett fixed her bright little eyes upon him a moment andtransferred them coldly to her niece. "You can't stay alone with thegentlemen. You're not--you're not at your blest Albany, my dear."</p><p>Isabel rose, blushing. "I wish I were," she said.</p><p>"Oh, I say, mother!" Ralph broke out.</p><p>"My dear Mrs. Touchett!" Lord Warburton murmured.</p><p>"I didn't make your country, my lord," Mrs. Touchett said majestically. "I must take it as I find it."</p><p>"Can't I stay with my own cousin?" Isabel enquired.</p><p>"I'm not aware that Lord Warburton is your cousin."</p><p>"Perhaps I had better go to bed!" the visitor suggested. "That will arrange it."</p><p>Mrs. Touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again. "Oh, if it's necessary I'll stay up till midnight."</p><p>Ralph meanwhile handed Isabel her candlestick. He had been watchingher; it had seemed to him her temper was involved--an accident thatmight be interesting. But if he had expected anything of a flare he wasdisappointed, for the girl simply laughed a little, nodded good-nightand withdrew accompanied by her aunt. For himself he was annoyed at hismother, though he thought she was right. Above-stairs the two ladiesseparated at Mrs. Touchett's door. Isabel had said nothing on her wayup.</p><p>"Of course you're vexed at my interfering with you," said Mrs. Touchett.</p><p>Isabel considered. "I'm not vexed, but I'm surprised--and a gooddeal mystified. Wasn't it proper I should remain in the drawing-room?"</p><p>"Not in the least. Young girls here--in decent houses--don't sit alone with the gentlemen late at night."</p><p>"You were very right to tell me then," said Isabel. "I don't understand it, but I'm very glad to know it.</p><p>"I shall always tell you," her aunt answered, "whenever I see you taking what seems to me too much liberty."</p><p>"Pray do; but I don't say I shall always think your remonstrance just."</p><p>"Very likely not. You're too fond of your own ways."</p><p>"Yes, I think I'm very fond of them. But I always want to know the things one shouldn't do."</p><p>"So as to do them?" asked her aunt.</p><p>"So as to choose," said Isabel.</p></span><span id = 957 ><p>As she was devoted to romantic effects Lord Warburton ventured toexpress a hope that she would come some day and see his house, a verycurious old place. He extracted from Mrs. Touchett a promise that shewould bring her niece to Lockleigh, and Ralph signified his willingnessto attend the ladies if his father should be able to spare him. LordWarburton assured our heroine that in the mean time his sisters wouldcome and see her. She knew something about his sisters, having soundedhim, during the hours they spent together while he was at Gardencourt,on many points connected with his family. When Isabel was interestedshe asked a great many questions, and as her companion was a copioustalker she urged him on this occasion by no means in vain. He told herhe had four sisters and two brothers and had lost both his parents. Thebrothers and sisters were very good people--"not particularly clever,you know," he said, "but very decent and pleasant;" and he was so goodas to hope Miss Archer might know them well. One of the brothers was inthe Church, settled in the family living, that of Lockleigh, which wasa heavy, sprawling parish, and was an excellent fellow in spite of histhinking differently from himself on every conceivable topic. And thenLord Warburton mentioned some of the opinions held by his brother,which were opinions Isabel had often heard expressed and that shesupposed to be entertained by a considerable portion of the humanfamily. Many of them indeed she supposed she had held herself, till heassured her she was quite mistaken, that it was really impossible, thatshe had doubtless imagined she entertained them, but that she mightdepend that, if she thought them over a little, she would find therewas nothing in them. When she answered that she had already thoughtseveral of the questions involved over very attentively he declaredthat she was only another example of what he had often been struckwith--the fact that, of all the people in the world, the Americans werethe most grossly superstitious. They were rank Tories and bigots, everyone of them; there were no conservatives like American conservatives.Her uncle and her cousin were there to prove it; nothing could be moremedieval than many of their views; they had ideas that people inEngland nowadays were ashamed to confess to; and they had the impudencemoreover, said his lordship, laughing, to pretend they knew more aboutthe needs and dangers of this poor dear stupid old England than he whowas born in it and owned a considerable slice of it--the more shame tohim! From all of which Isabel gathered that Lord Warburton was anobleman of the newest pattern, a reformer, a radical, a contemner ofancient ways. His other brother, who was in the army in India, wasrather wild and pig-headed and had not been of much use as yet but tomake debts for Warburton to pay--one of the most precious privileges ofan elder brother. "I don't think I shall pay any more," said herfriend; "he lives a monstrous deal better than I do, enjoys unheard-ofluxuries and thinks himself a much finer gentleman than I. As I'm aconsistent radical I go in only for equality; I don't go in for thesuperiority of the younger brothers." Two of his four sisters, thesecond and fourth, were married, one of them having done very well, asthey said, the other only so-so. The husband of the elder, LordHaycock, was a very good fellow, but unfortunately a horrid Tory; andhis wife, like all good English wives, was worse than her husband. Theother had espoused a smallish squire in Norfolk and, though married butthe other day, had already five children. This information and muchmore Lord Warburton imparted to his young American listener, takingpains to make many things clear and to lay bare to her apprehension thepeculiarities of English life. Isabel was often amused at hisexplicitness and at the small allowance he seemed to make either forher own experience or for her imagination. "He thinks I'm a barbarian,"she said, "and that I've never seen forks and spoons;" and she used toask him artless questions for the pleasure of hearing him answerseriously. Then when he had fallen into the trap, "It's a pity youcan't see me in my war-paint and feathers," she remarked; "if I hadknown how kind you are to the poor savages I would have brought over mynative costume!" Lord Warburton had travelled through the United Statesand knew much more about them than Isabel; he was so good as to saythat America was the most charming country in the world, but hisrecollections of it appeared to encourage the idea that Americans inEngland would need to have a great many things explained to them. "If Ihad only had you to explain things to me in America!" he said. "I wasrather puzzled in your country; in fact I was quite bewildered, and thetrouble was that the explanations only puzzled me more. You know Ithink they often gave me the wrong ones on purpose; they're ratherclever about that over there. But when I explain you can trust me;about what I tell you there's no mistake." There was no mistake atleast about his being very intelligent and cultivated and knowingalmost everything in the world. Although he gave the most interestingand thrilling glimpses Isabel felt he never did it to exhibit himself,and though he had had rare chances and had tumbled in, as she put it,for high prizes, he was as far as possible from making a merit of it.He had enjoyed the best things of life, but they had not spoiled hissense of proportion. His quality was a mixture of the effect of richexperience--oh, so easily come by!--with a modesty at times almostboyish; the sweet and wholesome savour of which--it was as agreeable assomething tasted--lost nothing from the addition of a tone ofresponsible kindness.</p><p>"I like your specimen English gentleman very much," Isabel said to Ralph after Lord Warburton had gone.</p><p>"I like him too--I love him well," Ralph returned. "But I pity him more."</p><p>Isabel looked at him askance. "Why, that seems to me his onlyfault--that one can't pity him a little. He appears to have everything,to know everything, to be everything."</p><p>"Oh, he's in a bad way!" Ralph insisted.</p><p>"I suppose you don't mean in health?"</p><p>"No, as to that he's detestably sound. What I mean is that he's aman with a great position who's playing all sorts of tricks with it. Hedoesn't take himself seriously."</p><p>"Does he regard himself as a joke?"</p><p>"Much worse; he regards himself as an imposition--as an abuse."</p><p>"Well, perhaps he is," said Isabel.</p><p>"Perhaps he is--though on the whole I don't think so. But in thatcase what's more pitiable than a sentient, self-conscious abuse plantedby other hands, deeply rooted but aching with a sense of its injustice?For me, in his place, I could be as solemn as a statue of Buddha. Heoccupies a position that appeals to my imagination. Greatresponsibilities, great opportunities, great consideration, greatwealth, great power, a natural share in the public affairs of a greatcountry. But he's all in a muddle about himself, his position, hispower, and indeed about everything in the world. He's the victim of acritical age; he has ceased to believe in himself and he doesn't knowwhat to believe in. When I attempt to tell him (because if I were he Iknow very well what I should believe in) he calls me a pampered bigot.I believe he seriously thinks me an awful Philistine; he says I don'tunderstand my time. I understand it certainly better than he, who canneither abolish himself as a nuisance nor maintain himself as aninstitution."</p><p>"He doesn't look very wretched," Isabel observed.</p><p>"Possibly not; though, being a man of a good deal of charming taste,I think he often has uncomfortable hours. But what is it to say of abeing of his opportunities that he's not miserable? Besides, I believehe is."</p><p>"I don't," said Isabel.</p><p>"Well," her cousin rejoined, "if he isn't he ought to be!"</p><p>In the afternoon she spent an hour with her uncle on the lawn, wherethe old man sat, as usual, with his shawl over his legs and his largecup of diluted tea in his hands. In the course of conversation he askedher what she thought of their late visitor.</p><p>Isabel was prompt. "I think he's charming."</p><p>"He's a nice person," said Mr. Touchett, "but I don't recommend you to fall in love with him."</p><p>"I shall not do it then; I shall never fall in love but on yourrecommendation. Moreover," Isabel added, "my cousin gives me rather asad account of Lord Warburton."</p><p>"Oh, indeed? I don't know what there may be to say, but you must remember that Ralph must talk."</p><p>"He thinks your friend's too subversive--or not subversive enough! I don't quite understand which," said Isabel.</p><p>The old man shook his head slowly, smiled and put down his cup. "Idon't know which either. He goes very far, but it's quite possible hedoesn't go far enough. He seems to want to do away with a good manythings, but he seems to want to remain himself. I suppose that'snatural, but it's rather inconsistent."</p><p>"Oh, I hope he'll remain himself," said Isabel. "If he were to be done away with his friends would miss him sadly."</p><p>"Well," said the old man, "I guess he'll stay and amuse his friends.I should certainly miss him very much here at Gardencourt. He alwaysamuses me when he comes over, and I think he amuses himself as well.There's a considerable number like him, round in society; they're veryfashionable just now. I don't know what they're trying to do--whetherthey're trying to get up a revolution. I hope at any rate they'll putit off till after I'm gone. You see they want to disestablisheverything; but I'm a pretty big landowner here, and I don't want to bedisestablished. I wouldn't have come over if I had thought they weregoing to behave like that," Mr. Touchett went on with expandinghilarity. "I came over because I thought England was a safe country. Icall it a regular fraud if they are going to introduce any considerablechanges; there'll be a large number disappointed in that case."</p><p>"Oh, I do hope they'll make a revolution!" Isabel exclaimed. "I should delight in seeing a revolution."</p><p>"Let me see," said her uncle, with a humorous intention; "I forgetwhether you're on the side of the old or on the side of the new. I'veheard you take such opposite views."</p><p>"I'm on the side of both. I guess I'm a little on the side ofeverything. In a revolution--after it was well begun--I think I shouldbe a high, proud loyalist. One sympathises more with them, and they'vea chance to behave so exquisitely. I mean so picturesquely."</p><p>"I don't know that I understand what you mean by behaving picturesquely, but it seems to me that you do that always, my dear."</p><p>"Oh, you lovely man, if I could believe that!" the girl interrupted.</p><p>"I'm afraid, after all, you won't have the pleasure of goinggracefully to the guillotine here just now," Mr. Touchett went on. "Ifyou want to see a big outbreak you must pay us a long visit. You see,when you come to the point it wouldn't suit them to be taken at theirword."</p><p>"Of whom are you speaking?"</p><p>"Well, I mean Lord Warburton and his friends--the radicals of theupper class. Of course I only know the way it strikes me. They talkabout the changes, but I don't think they quite realise. You and I, youknow, we know what it is to have lived under democratic institutions: Ialways thought them very comfortable, but I was used to them from thefirst. And then I ain't a lord; you're a lady, my dear, but I ain't alord. Now over here I don't think it quite comes home to them. It's amatter of every day and every hour, and I don't think many of themwould find it as pleasant as what they've got. Of course if they wantto try, it's their own business; but I expect they won't try very hard."</p><p>"Don't you think they're sincere?" Isabel asked.</p><p>"Well, they want to FEEL earnest," Mr. Touchett allowed; "but itseems as if they took it out in theories mostly. Their radical viewsare a kind of amusement; they've got to have some amusement, and theymight have coarser tastes than that. You see they're very luxurious,and these progressive ideas are about their biggest luxury. They makethem feel moral and yet don't damage their position. They think a greatdeal of their position; don't let one of them ever persuade you hedoesn't, for if you were to proceed on that basis you'd be pulled upvery short."</p><p>Isabel followed her uncle's argument, which he unfolded with hisquaint distinctness, most attentively, and though she was unacquaintedwith the British aristocracy she found it in harmony with her generalimpressions of human nature. But she felt moved to put in a protest onLord Warburton's behalf. "I don't believe Lord Warburton's a humbug; Idon't care what the others are. I should like to see Lord Warburton putto the test."</p><p>"Heaven deliver me from my friends!" Mr. Touchett answered. "LordWarburton's a very amiable young man--a very fine young man. He has ahundred thousand a year. He owns fifty thousand acres of the soil ofthis little island and ever so many other things besides. He has half adozen houses to live in. He has a seat in Parliament as I have one atmy own dinner-table. He has elegant tastes--cares for literature, forart, for science, for charming young ladies. The most elegant is histaste for the new views. It affords him a great deal of pleasure--moreperhaps than anything else, except the young ladies. His old house overthere--what does he call it, Lockleigh?--is very attractive; but Idon't think it's as pleasant as this. That doesn't matter, however--hehas so many others. His views don't hurt any one as far as I can see;they certainly don't hurt himself. And if there were to be a revolutionhe would come off very easily. They wouldn't touch him, they'd leavehim as he is: he's too much liked."</p><p>"Ah, he couldn't be a martyr even if he wished!" Isabel sighed. "That's a very poor position."</p><p>"He'll never be a martyr unless you make him one," said the old man.</p><p>Isabel shook her head; there might have been something laughable inthe fact that she did it with a touch of melancholy. "I shall nevermake any one a martyr."</p><p>"You'll never be one, I hope."</p><p>"I hope not. But you don't pity Lord Warburton then as Ralph does?"</p><p>Her uncle looked at her a while with genial acuteness. "Yes, I do, after all!"</p></span><span id = 958 ><p>The two Misses Molyneux, this nobleman's sisters, came presently tocall upon her, and Isabel took a fancy to the young ladies, whoappeared to her to show a most original stamp. It is true that when shedescribed them to her cousin by that term he declared that no epithetcould be less applicable than this to the two Misses Molyneux, sincethere were fifty thousand young women in England who exactly resembledthem. Deprived of this advantage, however, Isabel's visitors retainedthat of an extreme sweetness and shyness of demeanour, and of having,as she thought, eyes like the balanced basins, the circles of"ornamental water," set, in parterres, among the geraniums.</p><p>"They're not morbid, at any rate, whatever they are," our heroinesaid to herself; and she deemed this a great charm, for two or three ofthe friends of her girlhood had been regrettably open to the charge(they would have been so nice without it), to say nothing of Isabel'shaving occasionally suspected it as a tendency of her own. The MissesMolyneux were not in their first youth, but they had bright, freshcomplexions and something of the smile of childhood. Yes, their eyes,which Isabel admired, were round, quiet and contented, and theirfigures, also of a generous roundness, were encased in sealskinjackets. Their friendliness was great, so great that they were almostembarrassed to show it; they seemed somewhat afraid of the young ladyfrom the other side of the world and rather looked than spoke theirgood wishes. But they made it clear to her that they hoped she wouldcome to luncheon at Lockleigh, where they lived with their brother, andthen they might see her very, very often. They wondered if she wouldn'tcome over some day, and sleep: they were expecting some people on thetwenty-ninth, so perhaps she would come while the people were there.</p><p>"I'm afraid it isn't any one very remarkable," said the elder sister; "but I dare say you'll take us as you find us."</p><p>"I shall find you delightful; I think you're enchanting just as you are," replied Isabel, who often praised profusely.</p><p>Her visitors flushed, and her cousin told her, after they were gone,that if she said such things to those poor girls they would think shewas in some wild, free manner practising on them: he was sure it wasthe first time they had been called enchanting.</p><p>"I can't help it," Isabel answered. "I think it's lovely to be soquiet and reasonable and satisfied. I should like to be like that."</p><p>"Heaven forbid!" cried Ralph with ardour.</p><p>"I mean to try and imitate them," said Isabel. "I want very much to see them at home."</p><p>She had this pleasure a few days later, when, with Ralph and hismother, she drove over to Lockleigh. She found the Misses Molyneuxsitting in a vast drawing-room (she perceived afterwards it was one ofseveral) in a wilderness of faded chintz; they were dressed on thisoccasion in black velveteen. Isabel liked them even better at home thanshe had done at Gardencourt, and was more than ever struck with thefact that they were not morbid. It had seemed to her before that ifthey had a fault it was a want of play of mind; but she presently sawthey were capable of deep emotion. Before luncheon she was alone withthem for some time, on one side of the room, while Lord Warburton, at adistance, talked to Mrs. Touchett.</p><p>"Is it true your brother's such a great radical?" Isabel asked. Sheknew it was true, but we have seen that her interest in human naturewas keen, and she had a desire to draw the Misses Molyneux out.</p><p>"Oh dear, yes; he's immensely advanced," said Mildred, the younger sister.</p><p>"At the same time Warburton's very reasonable," Miss Molyneux observed.</p><p>Isabel watched him a moment at the other side of the room; he wasclearly trying hard to make himself agreeable to Mrs. Touchett. Ralphhad met the frank advances of one of the dogs before the fire that thetemperature of an English August, in the ancient expanses, had not madean impertinence. "Do you suppose your brother's sincere?" Isabelenquired with a smile.</p><p>"Oh, he must be, you know!" Mildred exclaimed quickly, while the elder sister gazed at our heroine in silence.</p><p>"Do you think he would stand the test?"</p><p>"The test?"</p><p>"I mean for instance having to give up all this."</p><p>"Having to give up Lockleigh?" said Miss Molyneux, finding her voice.</p><p>"Yes, and the other places; what are they called?"</p><p>The two sisters exchanged an almost frightened glance. "Do youmean--do you mean on account of the expense?" the younger one asked.</p><p>"I dare say he might let one or two of his houses," said the other.</p><p>"Let them for nothing?" Isabel demanded.</p><p>"I can't fancy his giving up his property," said Miss Molyneux.</p><p>"Ah, I'm afraid he is an impostor!" Isabel returned. "Don't you think it's a false position?"</p><p>Her companions, evidently, had lost themselves. "My brother's position?" Miss Molyneux enquired.</p><p>"It's thought a very good position," said the younger sister. "It's the first position in this part of the county."</p><p>"I dare say you think me very irreverent," Isabel took occasion toremark. "I suppose you revere your brother and are rather afraid ofhim."</p><p>"Of course one looks up to one's brother," said Miss Molyneux simply.</p><p>"If you do that he must be very good--because you, evidently, are beautifully good."</p><p>"He's most kind. It will never be known, the good he does."</p><p>"His ability is known," Mildred added; "every one thinks it's immense."</p><p>"Oh, I can see that," said Isabel. "But if I were he I should wishto fight to the death: I mean for the heritage of the past. I shouldhold it tight."</p><p>"I think one ought to be liberal," Mildred argued gently. "We've always been so, even from the earliest times."</p><p>"Ah well," said Isabel, "you've made a great success of it; I don't wonder you like it. I see you're very fond of crewels."</p><p>When Lord Warburton showed her the house, after luncheon, it seemedto her a matter of course that it should be a noble picture. Within, ithad been a good deal modernised--some of its best points had lost theirpurity; but as they saw it from the gardens, a stout grey pile, of thesoftest, deepest, most weather-fretted hue, rising from a broad, stillmoat, it affected the young visitor as a castle in a legend. The daywas cool and rather lustreless; the first note of autumn had beenstruck, and the watery sunshine rested on the walls in blurred anddesultory gleams, washing them, as it were, in places tenderly chosen,where the ache of antiquity was keenest. Her host's brother, the Vicar,had come to luncheon, and Isabel had had five minutes' talk withhim--time enough to institute a search for a rich ecclesiasticism andgive it up as vain. The marks of the Vicar of Lockleigh were a big,athletic figure, a candid, natural countenance, a capacious appetiteand a tendency to indiscriminate laughter. Isabel learned afterwardsfrom her cousin that before taking orders he had been a mighty wrestlerand that he was still, on occasion--in the privacy of the family circleas it were--quite capable of flooring his man. Isabel liked him--shewas in the mood for liking everything; but her imagination was a gooddeal taxed to think of him as a source of spiritual aid. The wholeparty, on leaving lunch, went to walk in the grounds; but LordWarburton exercised some ingenuity in engaging his least familiar guestin a stroll apart from the others.</p><p>"I wish you to see the place properly, seriously," he said. "Youcan't do so if your attention is distracted by irrelevant gossip." Hisown conversation (though he told Isabel a good deal about the house,which had a very curious history) was not purely archaeological; hereverted at intervals to matters more personal --matters personal tothe young lady as well as to himself. But at last, after a pause ofsome duration, returning for a moment to their ostensible theme, "Ah,well," he said, "I'm very glad indeed you like the old barrack. I wishyou could see more of it --that you could stay here a while. My sistershave taken an immense fancy to you--if that would be any inducement."</p><p>"There's no want of inducements," Isabel answered; "but I'm afraid I can't make engagements. I'm quite in my aunt's hands."</p><p>"Ah, pardon me if I say I don't exactly believe that. I'm pretty sure you can do whatever you want."</p><p>"I'm sorry if I make that impression on you; I don't think it's a nice impression to make."</p><p>"It has the merit of permitting me to hope." And Lord Warburton paused a moment.</p><p>"To hope what?"</p><p>"That in future I may see you often."</p><p>"Ah," said Isabel, "to enjoy that pleasure I needn't be so terribly emancipated."</p><p>"Doubtless not; and yet, at the same time, I don't think your uncle likes me."</p><p>"You're very much mistaken. I've heard him speak very highly of you."</p><p>"I'm glad you have talked about me," said Lord Warburton. "But, Inevertheless don't think he'd like me to keep coming to Gardencourt."</p><p>"I can't answer for my uncle's tastes," the girl rejoined, "though Iought as far as possible to take them into account. But for myself Ishall be very glad to see you."</p><p>"Now that's what I like to hear you say. I'm charmed when you say that."</p><p>"You're easily charmed, my lord," said Isabel.</p><p>"No, I'm not easily charmed!" And then he stopped a moment. "But you've charmed me, Miss Archer."</p><p>These words were uttered with an indefinable sound which startledthe girl; it struck her as the prelude to something grave: she hadheard the sound before and she recognised it. She had no wish, however,that for the moment such a prelude should have a sequel, and she saidas gaily as possible and as quickly as an appreciable degree ofagitation would allow her: "I'm afraid there's no prospect of my beingable to come here again."</p><p>"Never?" said Lord Warburton.</p><p>"I won't say 'never'; I should feel very melodramatic."</p><p>"May I come and see you then some day next week?"</p><p>"Most assuredly. What is there to prevent it?"</p><p>"Nothing tangible. But with you I never feel safe. I've a sort of sense that you're always summing people up."</p><p>"You don't of necessity lose by that."</p><p>"It's very kind of you to say so; but, even if I gain, stern justiceis not what I most love. Is Mrs. Touchett going to take you abroad?"</p><p>"I hope so."</p><p>"Is England not good enough for you?"</p><p>"That's a very Machiavellian speech; it doesn't deserve an answer. I want to see as many countries as I can."</p><p>"Then you'll go on judging, I suppose."</p><p>"Enjoying, I hope, too."</p><p>"Yes, that's what you enjoy most; I can't make out what you're upto," said Lord Warburton. "You strike me as having mysteriouspurposes--vast designs."</p><p>"You're so good as to have a theory about me which I don't at allfill out. Is there anything mysterious in a purpose entertained andexecuted every year, in the most public manner, by fifty thousand of myfellow-countrymen--the purpose of improving one's mind by foreigntravel?"</p><p>"You can't improve your mind, Miss Archer," her companion declared."It's already a most formidable instrument. It looks down on us all; itdespises us."</p><p>"Despises you? You're making fun of me," said Isabel seriously.</p><p>"Well, you think us 'quaint'--that's the same thing. I won't bethought 'quaint,' to begin with; I'm not so in the least. I protest."</p><p>"That protest is one of the quaintest things I've ever heard," Isabel answered with a smile.</p><p>Lord Warburton was briefly silent. "You judge only from theoutside--you don't care," he said presently. "You only care to amuseyourself." The note she had heard in his voice a moment beforereappeared, and mixed with it now was an audible strain ofbitterness--a bitterness so abrupt and inconsequent that the girl wasafraid she had hurt him. She had often heard that the English are ahighly eccentric people, and she had even read in some ingenious authorthat they are at bottom the most romantic of races. Was Lord Warburtonsuddenly turning romantic--was he going to make her a scene, in his ownhouse, only the third time they had met? She was reassured quicklyenough by her sense of his great good manners, which was not impairedby the fact that he had already touched the furthest limit of goodtaste in expressing his admiration of a young lady who had confided inhis hospitality. She was right in trusting to his good manners, for hepresently went on, laughing a little and without a trace of the accentthat had discomposed her: "I don't mean of course that you amuseyourself with trifles. You select great materials; the foibles, theafflictions of human nature, the peculiarities of nations!"</p><p>"As regards that," said Isabel, "I should find in my own nationentertainment for a lifetime. But we've a long drive, and my aunt willsoon wish to start." She turned back toward the others and LordWarburton walked beside her in silence. But before they reached theothers, "I shall come and see you next week," he said.</p><p>She had received an appreciable shock, but as it died away she feltthat she couldn't pretend to herself that it was altogether a painfulone. Nevertheless she made answer to his declaration, coldly enough,"Just as you please." And her coldness was not the calculation of hereffect--a game she played in a much smaller degree than would haveseemed probable to many critics. It came from a certain fear.</p></span><span id = 959 ><p>The day after her visit to Lockleigh she received a note from herfriend Miss Stackpole--a note of which the envelope, exhibiting inconjunction the postmark of Liverpool and the neat calligraphy of thequick-fingered Henrietta, caused her some liveliness of emotion. "HereI am, my lovely friend," Miss Stackpole wrote; "I managed to get off atlast. I decided only the night before I left New York--the Interviewerhaving come round to my figure. I put a few things into a bag, like aveteran journalist, and came down to the steamer in a street-car. Whereare you and where can we meet? I suppose you're visiting at some castleor other and have already acquired the correct accent. Perhaps even youhave married a lord; I almost hope you have, for I want someintroductions to the first people and shall count on you for a few. TheInterviewer wants some light on the nobility. My first impressions (ofthe people at large) are not rose-coloured; but I wish to talk themover with you, and you know that, whatever I am, at least I'm notsuperficial. I've also something very particular to tell you. Doappoint a meeting as quickly as you can; come to London (I should likeso much to visit the sights with you) or else let me come to you,wherever you are. I will do so with pleasure; for you know everythinginterests me and I wish to see as much as possible of the inner life."</p><p>Isabel judged best not to show this letter to her uncle; but sheacquainted him with its purport, and, as she expected, he begged herinstantly to assure Miss Stackpole, in his name, that he should bedelighted to receive her at Gardencourt. "Though she's a literarylady," he said, "I suppose that, being an American, she won't show meup, as that other one did. She has seen others like me."</p><p>"She has seen no other so delightful!" Isabel answered; but she wasnot altogether at ease about Henrietta's reproductive instincts, whichbelonged to that side of her friend's character which she regarded withleast complacency. She wrote to Miss Stackpole, however, that she wouldbe very welcome under Mr. Touchett's roof; and this alert young womanlost no time in announcing her prompt approach. She had gone up toLondon, and it was from that centre that she took the train for thestation nearest to Gardencourt, where Isabel and Ralph were in waitingto receive her.</p><p>"Shall I love her or shall I hate her?" Ralph asked while they moved along the platform.</p><p>"Whichever you do will matter very little to her," said Isabel. "She doesn't care a straw what men think of her."</p><p>"As a man I'm bound to dislike her then. She must be a kind of monster. Is she very ugly?"</p><p>"No, she's decidedly pretty."</p><p>"A female interviewer--a reporter in petticoats? I'm very curious to see her," Ralph conceded.</p><p>"It's very easy to laugh at her but it is not easy to be as brave as she."</p><p>"I should think not; crimes of violence and attacks on the personrequire more or less pluck. Do you suppose she'll interview me?"</p><p>"Never in the world. She'll not think you of enough importance."</p><p>"You'll see," said Ralph. "She'll send a description of us all, including Bunchie, to her newspaper."</p><p>"I shall ask her not to," Isabel answered.</p><p>"You think she's capable of it then?"</p><p>"Perfectly."</p><p>"And yet you've made her your bosom-friend?"</p><p>"I've not made her my bosom-friend; but I like her in spite of her faults."</p><p>"Ah well," said Ralph, "I'm afraid I shall dislike her in spite of her merits."</p><p>"You'll probably fall in love with her at the end of three days."</p><p>"And have my love-letters published in the Interviewer? Never!" cried the young man.</p><p>The train presently arrived, and Miss Stackpole, promptlydescending, proved, as Isabel had promised, quite delicately, eventhough rather provincially, fair. She was a neat, plump person, ofmedium stature, with a round face, a small mouth, a delicatecomplexion, a bunch of light brown ringlets at the back of her head anda peculiarly open, surprised-looking eye. The most striking point inher appearance was the remarkable fixedness of this organ, which restedwithout impudence or defiance, but as if in conscientious exercise of anatural right, upon every object it happened to encounter. It rested inthis manner upon Ralph himself, a little arrested by Miss Stackpole'sgracious and comfortable aspect, which hinted that it wouldn't be soeasy as he had assumed to disapprove of her. She rustled, sheshimmered, in fresh, dove-coloured draperies, and Ralph saw at a glancethat she was as crisp and new and comprehensive as a first issue beforethe folding. From top to toe she had probably no misprint. She spoke ina clear, high voice--a voice not rich but loud; yet after she had takenher place with her companions in Mr. Touchett's carriage she struck himas not all in the large type, the type of horrid "headings," that hehad expected. She answered the enquiries made of her by Isabel,however, and in which the young man ventured to join, with copiouslucidity; and later, in the library at Gardencourt, when she had madethe acquaintance of Mr. Touchett (his wife not having thought itnecessary to appear) did more to give the measure of her confidence inher powers.</p><p>"Well, I should like to know whether you consider yourselvesAmerican or English," she broke out. "If once I knew I could talk toyou accordingly."</p><p>"Talk to us anyhow and we shall be thankful," Ralph liberally answered.</p><p>She fixed her eyes on him, and there was something in theircharacter that reminded him of large polished buttons--buttons thatmight have fixed the elastic loops of some tense receptacle: he seemedto see the reflection of surrounding objects on the pupil. Theexpression of a button is not usually deemed human, but there wassomething in Miss Stackpole's gaze that made him, as a very modest man,feel vaguely embarrassed--less inviolate, more dishonoured, than heliked. This sensation, it must be added, after he had spent a day ortwo in her company, sensibly diminished, though it never wholly lapsed."I don't suppose that you're going to undertake to persuade me thatyou're an American," she said.</p><p>"To please you I'll be an Englishman, I'll be a Turk!"</p><p>"Well, if you can change about that way you're very welcome," Miss Stackpole returned.</p><p>"I'm sure you understand everything and that differences of nationality are no barrier to you," Ralph went on.</p><p>Miss Stackpole gazed at him still. "Do you mean the foreign languages?"</p><p>"The languages are nothing. I mean the spirit--the genius."</p><p>"I'm not sure that I understand you," said the correspondent of the Interviewer; "but I expect I shall before I leave."</p><p>"He's what's called a cosmopolite," Isabel suggested.</p><p>"That means he's a little of everything and not much of any. I must say I think patriotism is like charity--it begins at home."</p><p>"Ah, but where does home begin, Miss Stackpole?" Ralph enquired.</p><p>"I don't know where it begins, but I know where it ends. It ended a long time before I got here."</p><p>"Don't you like it over here?" asked Mr. Touchett with his aged, innocent voice.</p><p>"Well, sir, I haven't quite made up my mind what ground I shalltake. I feel a good deal cramped. I felt it on the journey fromLiverpool to London."</p><p>"Perhaps you were in a crowded carriage," Ralph suggested.</p><p>"Yes, but it was crowded with friends--party of Americans whoseacquaintance I had made upon the steamer; a lovely group from LittleRock, Arkansas. In spite of that I felt cramped--I felt somethingpressing upon me; I couldn't tell what it was. I felt at the verycommencement as if I were not going to accord with the atmosphere. ButI suppose I shall make my own atmosphere. That's the true way--then youcan breathe. Your surroundings seem very attractive."</p><p>"Ah, we too are a lovely group!" said Ralph. "Wait a little and you'll see."</p><p>Miss Stackpole showed every disposition to wait and evidently wasprepared to make a considerable stay at Gardencourt. She occupiedherself in the mornings with literary labour; but in spite of thisIsabel spent many hours with her friend, who, once her daily taskperformed, deprecated, in fact defied, isolation. Isabel speedily foundoccasion to desire her to desist from celebrating the charms of theircommon sojourn in print, having discovered, on the second morning ofMiss Stackpole's visit, that she was engaged on a letter to theInterviewer, of which the title, in her exquisitely neat and legiblehand (exactly that of the copybooks which our heroine remembered atschool) was "Americans and Tudors--Glimpses of Gardencourt." MissStackpole, with the best conscience in the world, offered to read herletter to Isabel, who immediately put in her protest.</p><p>"I don't think you ought to do that. I don't think you ought to describe the place."</p><p>Henrietta gazed at her as usual. "Why, it's just what the people want, and it's a lovely place."</p><p>"It's too lovely to be put in the newspapers, and it's not what my uncle wants."</p><p>"Don't you believe that!" cried Henrietta. "They're always delighted afterwards."</p><p>"My uncle won't be delighted--nor my cousin either. They'll consider it a breach of hospitality."</p><p>Miss Stackpole showed no sense of confusion; she simply wiped herpen, very neatly, upon an elegant little implement which she kept forthe purpose, and put away her manuscript. "Of course if you don'tapprove I won't do it; but I sacrifice a beautiful subject."</p><p>"There are plenty of other subjects, there are subjects all roundyou. We'll take some drives; I'll show you some charming scenery."</p><p>"Scenery's not my department; I always need a human interest. Youknow I'm deeply human, Isabel; I always was," Miss Stackpole rejoined."I was going to bring in your cousin--the alienated American. There's agreat demand just now for the alienated American, and your cousin's abeautiful specimen. I should have handled him severely."</p><p>"He would have died of it!" Isabel exclaimed. "Not of the severity, but of the publicity."</p><p>"Well, I should have liked to kill him a little. And I should havedelighted to do your uncle, who seems to me a much nobler type--theAmerican faithful still. He's a grand old man; I don't see how he canobject to my paying him honour."</p><p>Isabel looked at her companion in much wonderment; it struck her asstrange that a nature in which she found so much to esteem should breakdown so in spots. "My poor Henrietta," she said, "you've no sense ofprivacy."</p><p>Henrietta coloured deeply, and for a moment her brilliant eyes weresuffused, while Isabel found her more than ever inconsequent. "You dome great injustice," said Miss Stackpole with dignity. "I've neverwritten a word about myself!"</p><p>"I'm very sure of that; but it seems to me one should be modest for others also!"</p><p>"Ah, that's very good!" cried Henrietta, seizing her pen again."Just let me make a note of it and I'll put it in somewhere." she was athoroughly good-natured woman, and half an hour later she was in ascheerful a mood as should have been looked for in a newspaper-lady inwant of matter. "I've promised to do the social side," she said toIsabel; "and how can I do it unless I get ideas? If I can't describethis place don't you know some place I can describe?" Isabel promisedshe would bethink herself, and the next day, in conversation with herfriend, she happened to mention her visit to Lord Warburton's ancienthouse. "Ah, you must take me there--that's just the place for me!" MissStackpole cried. "I must get a glimpse of the nobility."</p><p>"I can't take you," said Isabel; "but Lord Warburton's coming here,and you'll have a chance to see him and observe him. Only if you intendto repeat his conversation I shall certainly give him warning."</p><p>"Don't do that," her companion pleaded; "I want him to be natural."</p><p>"An Englishman's never so natural as when he's holding his tongue," Isabel declared.</p><p>It was not apparent, at the end of three days, that her cousin had,according to her prophecy, lost his heart to their visitor, though hehad spent a good deal of time in her society. They strolled about thepark together and sat under the trees, and in the afternoon, when itwas delightful to float along the Thames, Miss Stackpole occupied aplace in the boat in which hitherto Ralph had had but a singlecompanion. Her presence proved somehow less irreducible to softparticles than Ralph had expected in the natural perturbation of hissense of the perfect solubility of that of his cousin; for thecorrespondent of the Interviewer prompted mirth in him, and he had longsince decided that the crescendo of mirth should be the flower of hisdeclining days. Henrietta, on her side, failed a little to justifyIsabel's declaration with regard to her indifference to masculineopinion; for poor Ralph appeared to have presented himself to her as anirritating problem, which it would be almost immoral not to work out.</p><p>"What does he do for a living?" she asked of Isabel the evening ofher arrival. "Does he go round all day with his hands in his pockets?"</p><p>"He does nothing," smiled Isabel; "he's a gentleman of large leisure."</p><p>"Well, I call that a shame--when I have to work like a car-conductor," Miss Stackpole replied. "I should like to show him up."</p><p>"He's in wretched health; he's quite unfit for work," Isabel urged.</p><p>"Pshaw! don't you believe it. I work when I'm sick," cried herfriend. Later, when she stepped into the boat on joining thewater-party, she remarked to Ralph that she supposed he hated her andwould like to drown her.</p><p>"Ah no," said Ralph, "I keep my victims for a slower torture. And you'd be such an interesting one!"</p><p>"Well, you do torture me; I may say that. But I shock all your prejudices; that's one comfort."</p><p>"My prejudices? I haven't a prejudice to bless myself with. There's intellectual poverty for you."</p><p>"The more shame to you; I've some delicious ones. Of course I spoilyour flirtation, or whatever it is you call it, with your cousin; but Idon't care for that, as I render her the service of drawing you out.She'll see how thin you are."</p><p>"Ah, do draw me out!" Ralph exclaimed. "So few people will take the trouble."</p><p>Miss Stackpole, in this undertaking, appeared to shrink from noeffort; resorting largely, whenever the opportunity offered, to thenatural expedient of interrogation. On the following day the weatherwas bad, and in the afternoon the young man, by way of providing indooramusement, offered to show her the pictures. Henrietta strolled throughthe long gallery in his society, while he pointed out its principalornaments and mentioned the painters and subjects. Miss Stackpolelooked at the pictures in perfect silence, committing herself to noopinion, and Ralph was gratified by the fact that she delivered herselfof none of the little ready-made ejaculations of delight of which thevisitors to Gardencourt were so frequently lavish. This young ladyindeed, to do her justice, was but little addicted to the use ofconventional terms; there was something earnest and inventive in hertone, which at times, in its strained deliberation, suggested a personof high culture speaking a foreign language. Ralph Touchettsubsequently learned that she had at one time officiated as art criticto a journal of the other world; but she appeared, in spite of thisfact, to carry in her pocket none of the small change of admiration.Suddenly, just after he had called her attention to a charmingConstable, she turned and looked at him as if he himself had been apicture.</p><p>"Do you always spend your time like this?" she demanded.</p><p>"I seldom spend it so agreeably."</p><p>"Well, you know what I mean--without any regular occupation."</p><p>"Ah," said Ralph, "I'm the idlest man living."</p><p>Miss Stackpole directed her gaze to the Constable again, and Ralphbespoke her attention for a small Lancret hanging near it, whichrepresented a gentleman in a pink doublet and hose and a ruff, leaningagainst the pedestal of the statue of a nymph in a garden and playingthe guitar to two ladies seated on the grass. "That's my ideal of aregular occupation," he said.</p><p>Miss Stackpole turned to him again, and, though her eyes had restedupon the picture, he saw she had missed the subject. She was thinkingof something much more serious. "I don't see how you can reconcile itto your conscience."</p><p>"My dear lady, I have no conscience!"</p><p>"Well, I advise you to cultivate one. You'll need it the next time you go to America."</p><p>"I shall probably never go again."</p><p>"Are you ashamed to show yourself?"</p><p>Ralph meditated with a mild smile. "I suppose that if one has no conscience one has no shame."</p><p>"Well, you've got plenty of assurance," Henrietta declared. "Do you consider it right to give up your country?"</p><p>"Ah, one doesn't give up one's country any more than one gives UPone's grandmother. They're both antecedent to choice--elements of one'scomposition that are not to be eliminated."</p><p>"I suppose that means that you've tried and been worsted. What do they think of you over here?"</p><p>"They delight in me."</p><p>"That's because you truckle to them."</p><p>"Ah, set it down a little to my natural charm!" Ralph sighed.</p><p>"I don't know anything about your natural charm. If you've got anycharm it's quite unnatural. It's wholly acquired--or at least you'vetried hard to acquire it, living over here. I don't say you'vesucceeded. It's a charm that I don't appreciate, anyway. Make yourselfuseful in some way, and then we'll talk about it." "Well, now, tell mewhat I shall do," said Ralph.</p><p>"Go right home, to begin with."</p><p>"Yes, I see. And then?"</p><p>"Take right hold of something."</p><p>"Well, now, what sort of thing?"</p><p>"Anything you please, so long as you take hold. Some new idea, some big work."</p><p>"Is it very difficult to take hold?" Ralph enquired.</p><p>"Not if you put your heart into it."</p><p>"Ah, my heart," said Ralph. "If it depends upon my heart--!"</p><p>"Haven't you got a heart?"</p><p>"I had one a few days ago, but I've lost it since."</p><p>"You're not serious," Miss Stackpole remarked; "that's what's thematter with you." But for all this, in a day or two, she againpermitted him to fix her attention and on the later occasion assigned adifferent cause to her mysterious perversity. "I know what's the matterwith you, Mr. Touchett," she said. "You think you're too good to getmarried."</p><p>"I thought so till I knew you, Miss Stackpole," Ralph answered; "and then I suddenly changed my mind."</p><p>"Oh pshaw!" Henrietta groaned.</p><p>"Then it seemed to me," said Ralph, "that I was not good enough."</p><p>"It would improve you. Besides, it's your duty."</p><p>"Ah," cried the young man, "one has so many duties! Is that a duty too?"</p><p>"Of course it is--did you never know that before? It's every one's duty to get married."</p><p>Ralph meditated a moment; he was disappointed. There was somethingin Miss Stackpole he had begun to like; it seemed to him that if shewas not a charming woman she was at least a very good "sort." She waswanting in distinction, but, as Isabel had said, she was brave: shewent into cages, she flourished lashes, like a spangled lion-tamer. Hehad not supposed her to be capable of vulgar arts, but these last wordsstruck him as a false note. When a marriageable young woman urgesmatrimony on an unencumbered young man the most obvious explanation ofher conduct is not the altruistic impulse.</p><p>"Ah, well now, there's a good deal to be said about that," Ralph rejoined.</p><p>"There may be, but that's the principal thing. I must say I think itlooks very exclusive, going round all alone, as if you thought no womanwas good enough for you. Do you think you're better than any one elsein the world? In America it's usual for people to marry."</p><p>"If it's my duty," Ralph asked, "is it not, by analogy, yours as well?"</p><p>Miss Stackpole's ocular surfaces unwinkingly caught the sun. "Haveyou the fond hope of finding a flaw in my reasoning? Of course I've asgood a right to marry as any one else."</p><p>"Well then," said Ralph, "I won't say it vexes me to see you single. It delights me rather."</p><p>"You're not serious yet. You never will be."</p><p>"Shall you not believe me to be so on the day I tell you I desire to give up the practice of going round alone?"</p><p>Miss Stackpole looked at him for a moment in a manner which seemedto announce a reply that might technically be called encouraging. Butto his great surprise this expression suddenly resolved itself into anappearance of alarm and even of resentment. "No, not even then," sheanswered dryly. After which she walked away.</p><p>"I've not conceived a passion for your friend," Ralph said thatevening to Isabel, "though we talked some time this morning about it."</p><p>"And you said something she didn't like," the girl replied.</p><p>Ralph stared. "Has she complained of me?"</p><p>"She told me she thinks there's something very low in the tone of Europeans towards women."</p><p>"Does she call me a European?"</p><p>"One of the worst. She told me you had said to her something that an American never would have said. But she didn't repeat it."</p><p>Ralph treated himself to a luxury of laughter. "She's an extraordinary combination. Did she think I was making love to her?"</p><p>"No; I believe even Americans do that. But she apparently thoughtyou mistook the intention of something she had said, and put an unkindconstruction on it."</p><p>"I thought she was proposing marriage to me and I accepted her. Was that unkind?"</p><p>Isabel smiled. "It was unkind to me. I don't want you to marry."</p><p>"My dear cousin, what's one to do among you all?" Ralph demanded."Miss Stackpole tells me it's my bounden duty, and that it's hers, ingeneral, to see I do mine!"</p><p>"She has a great sense of duty," said Isabel gravely. "She hasindeed, and it's the motive of everything she says. That's what I likeher for. She thinks it's unworthy of you to keep so many things toyourself. That's what she wanted to express. If you thought she wastrying to--to attract you, you were very wrong."</p><p>"It's true it was an odd way, but I did think she was trying to attract me. Forgive my depravity."</p><p>"You're very conceited. She had no interested views, and never supposed you would think she had."</p><p>"One must be very modest then to talk with such women," Ralph saidhumbly. "But it's a very strange type. She's too personal-- consideringthat she expects other people not to be. She walks in without knockingat the door."</p><p>"Yes," Isabel admitted, "she doesn't sufficiently recognise theexistence of knockers; and indeed I'm not sure that she doesn't thinkthem rather a pretentious ornament. She thinks one's door should standajar. But I persist in liking her."</p><p>"I persist in thinking her too familiar," Ralph rejoined, naturallysomewhat uncomfortable under the sense of having been doubly deceivedin Miss Stackpole.</p><p>"Well," said Isabel, smiling, "I'm afraid it's because she's rather vulgar that I like her."</p><p>"She would be flattered by your reason!"</p><p>"If I should tell her I wouldn't express it in that way. I should say it's because there's something of the 'people' in her."</p><p>"What do you know about the people? and what does she, for that matter?"</p><p>"She knows a great deal, and I know enough to feel that she's a kindof emanation of the great democracy--of the continent, the country, thenation. I don't say that she sums it all up, that would be too much toask of her. But she suggests it; she vividly figures it."</p><p>"You like her then for patriotic reasons. I'm afraid it is on those very grounds I object to her."</p><p>"Ah," said Isabel with a kind of joyous sigh, "I like so manythings! If a thing strikes me with a certain intensity I accept it. Idon't want to swagger, but I suppose I'm rather versatile. I likepeople to be totally different from Henrietta--in the style of LordWarburton's sisters for instance. So long as I look at the MissesMolyneux they seem to me to answer a kind of ideal. Then Henriettapresents herself, and I'm straightway convinced by her; not so much inrespect to herself as in respect to what masses behind her."</p><p>"Ah, you mean the back view of her," Ralph suggested.</p><p>"What she says is true," his cousin answered; "you'll never beserious. I like the great country stretching away beyond the rivers andacross the prairies, blooming and smiling and spreading till it stopsat the green Pacific! A strong, sweet, fresh odour seems to rise fromit, and Henrietta--pardon my simile--has something of that odour in hergarments."</p><p>Isabel blushed a little as she concluded this speech, and the blush,together with the momentary ardour she had thrown into it, was sobecoming to her that Ralph stood smiling at her for a moment after shehad ceased speaking. "I'm not sure the Pacific's so green as that," hesaid; "but you're a young woman of imagination. Henrietta, however,does smell of the Future--it almost knocks one down!"</p></span><span id = 960 ><p>He took a resolve after this not to misinterpret her words even whenMiss Stackpole appeared to strike the personal note most strongly. Hebethought himself that persons, in her view, were simple andhomogeneous organisms, and that he, for his own part, was too perverteda representative of the nature of man to have a right to deal with herin strict reciprocity. He carried out his resolve with a great deal oftact, and the young lady found in renewed contact with him no obstacleto the exercise of her genius for unshrinking enquiry, the generalapplication of her confidence. Her situation at Gardencourt therefore,appreciated as we have seen her to be by Isabel and full ofappreciation herself of that free play of intelligence which, to hersense, rendered Isabel's character a sister-spirit, and of the easyvenerableness of Mr. Touchett, whose noble tone, as she said, met withher full approval--her situation at Gardencourt would have beenperfectly comfortable had she not conceived an irresistible mistrust ofthe little lady for whom she had at first supposed herself obliged to"allow" as mistress of the house. She presently discovered, in truth,that this obligation was of the lightest and that Mrs. Touchett caredvery little how Miss Stackpole behaved. Mrs. Touchett had defined herto Isabel as both an adventuress and a bore--adventuresses usuallygiving one more of a thrill; she had expressed some surprise at herniece's having selected such a friend, yet had immediately added thatshe knew Isabel's friends were her own affair and that she had neverundertaken to like them all or to restrict the girl to those she liked.</p><p>"If you could see none but the people I like, my dear, you'd have avery small society," Mrs. Touchett frankly admitted; "and I don't thinkI like any man or woman well enough to recommend them to you. When itcomes to recommending it's a serious affair. I don't like MissStackpole--everything about her displeases me; she talks so much tooloud and looks at one as if one wanted to look at her--which onedoesn't. I'm sure she has lived all her life in a boarding-house, and Idetest the manners and the liberties of such places. If you ask me if Iprefer my own manners, which you doubtless think very bad, I'll tellyou that I prefer them immensely. Miss Stackpole knows I detestboarding-house civilisation, and she detests me for detesting it,because she thinks it the highest in the world. She'd like Gardencourta great deal better if it were a boarding-house. For me, I find italmost too much of one! We shall never get on together therefore, andthere's no use trying."</p><p>Mrs. Touchett was right in guessing that Henrietta disapproved ofher, but she had not quite put her finger on the reason. A day or twoafter Miss Stackpole's arrival she had made some invidious reflexionson American hotels, which excited a vein of counter-argument on thepart of the correspondent of the Interviewer, who in the exercise ofher profession had acquainted herself, in the western world, with everyform of caravansary. Henrietta expressed the opinion that Americanhotels were the best in the world, and Mrs. Touchett, fresh from arenewed struggle with them, recorded a conviction that they were theworst. Ralph, with his experimental geniality, suggested, by way ofhealing the breach, that the truth lay between the two extremes andthat the establishments in question ought to be described as fairmiddling. This contribution to the discussion, however, Miss Stackpolerejected with scorn. Middling indeed! If they were not the best in theworld they were the worst, but there was nothing middling about anAmerican hotel.</p><p>"We judge from different points of view, evidently," said Mrs.Touchett. "I like to be treated as an individual; you like to betreated as a 'party.'"</p><p>"I don't know what you mean," Henrietta replied. "I like to be treated as an American lady."</p><p>"Poor American ladies!" cried Mrs. Touchett with a laugh. "They're the slaves of slaves."</p><p>"They're the companions of freemen," Henrietta retorted.</p><p>"They're the companions of their servants--the Irish chambermaid and the negro waiter. They share their work."</p><p>"Do you call the domestics in an American household 'slaves'?" MissStackpole enquired. "If that's the way you desire to treat them, nowonder you don't like America."</p><p>"If you've not good servants you're miserable," Mrs. Touchettserenely said. "They're very bad in America, but I've five perfect onesin Florence."</p><p>"I don't see what you want with five," Henrietta couldn't helpobserving. "I don't think I should like to see five persons surroundingme in that menial position."</p><p>"I like them in that position better than in some others," proclaimed Mrs. Touchett with much meaning.</p><p>"Should you like me better if I were your butler, dear?" her husband asked.</p><p>"I don't think I should: you wouldn't at all have the tenue."</p><p>"The companions of freemen--I like that, Miss Stackpole," said Ralph. "It's a beautiful description."</p><p>"When I said freemen I didn't mean you, sir!"</p><p>And this was the only reward that Ralph got for his compliment. MissStackpole was baffled; she evidently thought there was somethingtreasonable in Mrs. Touchett's appreciation of a class which sheprivately judged to be a mysterious survival of feudalism. It wasperhaps because her mind was oppressed with this image that shesuffered some days to elapse before she took occasion to say to Isabel:"My dear friend, I wonder if you're growing faithless."</p><p>"Faithless? Faithless to you, Henrietta?"</p><p>"No, that would be a great pain; but it's not that."</p><p>"Faithless to my country then?"</p><p>"Ah, that I hope will never be. When I wrote to you from Liverpool Isaid I had something particular to tell you. You've never asked me whatit is. Is it because you've suspected?"</p><p>"Suspected what? As a rule I don't think I suspect," said Isabel.</p><p>"I remember now that phrase in your letter, but I confess I had forgotten it. What have you to tell me?"</p><p>Henrietta looked disappointed, and her steady gaze betrayed it. "Youdon't ask that right--as if you thought it important. You'rechanged--you're thinking of other things."</p><p>"Tell me what you mean, and I'll think of that."</p><p>"Will you really think of it? That's what I wish to be sure of."</p><p>"I've not much control of my thoughts, but I'll do my best," saidIsabel. Henrietta gazed at her, in silence, for a period which triedIsabel's patience, so that our heroine added at last: "Do you mean thatyou're going to be married?"</p><p>"Not till I've seen Europe!" said Miss Stackpole. "What are youlaughing at?" she went on. "What I mean is that Mr. Goodwood came outin the steamer with me."</p><p>"Ah!" Isabel responded.</p><p>"You say that right. I had a good deal of talk with him; he has come after you."</p><p>"Did he tell you so?"</p><p>"No, he told me nothing; that's how I knew it," said Henriettacleverly. "He said very little about you, but I spoke of you a gooddeal."</p><p>Isabel waited. At the mention of Mr. Goodwood's name she had turneda little pale. "I'm very sorry you did that," she observed at last.</p><p>"It was a pleasure to me, and I liked the way he listened. I couldhave talked a long time to such a listener; he was so quiet, sointense; he drank it all in."</p><p>"What did you say about me?" Isabel asked.</p><p>"I said you were on the whole the finest creature I know."</p><p>"I'm very sorry for that. He thinks too well of me already; he oughtn't to be encouraged."</p><p>"He's dying for a little encouragement. I see his face now, and hisearnest absorbed look while I talked. I never saw an ugly man look sohandsome."</p><p>"He's very simple-minded," said Isabel. "And he's not so ugly."</p><p>"There's nothing so simplifying as a grand passion."</p><p>"It's not a grand passion; I'm very sure it's not that."</p><p>"You don't say that as if you were sure."</p><p>Isabel gave rather a cold smile. "I shall say it better to Mr. Goodwood himself."</p><p>"He'll soon give you a chance," said Henrietta. Isabel offered noanswer to this assertion, which her companion made with an air of greatconfidence. "He'll find you changed," the latter pursued. "You've beenaffected by your new surroundings."</p><p>"Very likely. I'm affected by everything."</p><p>"By everything but Mr. Goodwood!" Miss Stackpole exclaimed with a slightly harsh hilarity.</p><p>Isabel failed even to smile back and in a moment she said: "Did he ask you to speak to me?"</p><p>"Not in so many words. But his eyes asked it--and his handshake, when he bade me good-bye."</p><p>"Thank you for doing so." And Isabel turned away.</p><p>"Yes, you're changed; you've got new ideas over here," her friend continued.</p><p>"I hope so," said Isabel; "one should get as many new ideas as possible."</p><p>"Yes; but they shouldn't interfere with the old ones when the old ones have been the right ones."</p><p>Isabel turned about again. "If you mean that I had any idea withregard to Mr. Goodwood--!" But she faltered before her friend'simplacable glitter.</p><p>"My dear child, you certainly encouraged him."</p><p>Isabel made for the moment as if to deny this charge; instead ofwhich, however, she presently answered: "It's very true. I didencourage him." And then she asked if her companion had learned fromMr. Goodwood what he intended to do. It was a concession to hercuriosity, for she disliked discussing the subject and found Henriettawanting in delicacy.</p><p>"I asked him, and he said he meant to do nothing," Miss Stackpoleanswered. "But I don't believe that; he's not a man to do nothing. Heis a man of high, bold action. Whatever happens to him he'll always dosomething, and whatever he does will always be right."</p><p>"I quite believe that." Henrietta might be wanting in delicacy, but it touched the girl, all the same, to hear this declaration.</p><p>"Ah, you do care for him!" her visitor rang out.</p><p>"Whatever he does will always be right," Isabel repeated. "When aman's of that infallible mould what does it matter to him what onefeels?"</p><p>"It may not matter to him, but it matters to one's self."</p><p>"Ah, what it matters to me--that's not what we're discussing," said Isabel with a cold smile.</p><p>This time her companion was grave. "Well, I don't care; you havechanged. You're not the girl you were a few short weeks ago, and Mr.Goodwood will see it. I expect him here any day."</p><p>"I hope he'll hate me then," said Isabel.</p><p>"I believe you hope it about as much as I believe him capable of it."</p><p>To this observation our heroine made no return; she was absorbed inthe alarm given her by Henrietta's intimation that Caspar Goodwoodwould present himself at Gardencourt. She pretended to herself,however, that she thought the event impossible, and, later, shecommunicated her disbelief to her friend. For the next forty-eighthours, nevertheless, she stood prepared to hear the young man's nameannounced. The feeling pressed upon her; it made the air sultry, as ifthere were to be a change of weather; and the weather, sociallyspeaking, had been so agreeable during Isabel's stay at Gardencourtthat any change would be for the worse. Her suspense indeed wasdissipated the second day. She had walked into the park in company withthe sociable Bunchie, and after strolling about for some time, in amanner at once listless and restless, had seated herself on agarden-bench, within sight of the house, beneath a spreading beech,where, in a white dress ornamented with black ribbons, she formed amongthe flickering shadows a graceful and harmonious image. She entertainedherself for some moments with talking to the little terrier, as to whomthe proposal of an ownership divided with her cousin had been appliedas impartially as possible--as impartially as Bunchie's own somewhatfickle and inconstant sympathies would allow. But she was notified forthe first time, on this occasion, of the finite character of Bunchie'sintellect; hitherto she had been mainly struck with its extent. Itseemed to her at last that she would do well to take a book; formerly,when heavy-hearted, she had been able, with the help of somewell-chosen volume, to transfer the seat of consciousness to the organof pure reason. Of late, it was not to be denied, literature had seemeda fading light, and even after she had reminded herself that heruncle's library was provided with a complete set of those authors whichno gentleman's collection should be without, she sat motionless andempty-handed, her eyes bent on the cool green turf of the lawn. Hermeditations were presently interrupted by the arrival of a servant whohanded her a letter. The letter bore the London postmark and wasaddressed in a hand she knew--that came into her vision, already soheld by him, with the vividness of the writer's voice or his face. Thisdocument proved short and may be given entire.</p><p>MY DEAR MISS ARCHER--I don't know whether you will have heard of mycoming to England, but even if you have not it will scarcely be asurprise to you. You will remember that when you gave me my dismissalat Albany, three months ago, I did not accept it. I protested againstit. You in fact appeared to accept my protest and to admit that I hadthe right on my side. I had come to see you with the hope that youwould let me bring you over to my conviction; my reasons forentertaining this hope had been of the best. But you disappointed it; Ifound you changed, and you were able to give me no reason for thechange. You admitted that you were unreasonable, and it was the onlyconcession you would make; but it was a very cheap one, because that'snot your character. No, you are not, and you never will be, arbitraryor capricious. Therefore it is that I believe you will let me see youagain. You told me that I'm not disagreeable to you, and I believe it;for I don't see why that should be. I shall always think of you; Ishall never think of any one else. I came to England simply because youare here; I couldn't stay at home after you had gone: I hated thecountry because you were not in it. If I like this country at presentit is only because it holds you. I have been to England before, buthave never enjoyed it much. May I not come and see you for half anhour? This at present is the dearest wish of yours faithfully</p><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>CASPAR GOODWOOD.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>Isabel read this missive with such deep attention that she had notperceived an approaching tread on the soft grass. Looking up, however,as she mechanically folded it she saw Lord Warburton standing beforeher.</p></span><span id = 961 ><p>She put the letter into her pocket and offered her visitor a smileof welcome, exhibiting no trace of discomposure and half surprised ather coolness.</p><p>"They told me you were out here," said Lord Warburton; "and as therewas no one in the drawing-room and it's really you that I wish to see,I came out with no more ado."</p><p>Isabel had got up; she felt a wish, for the moment, that he should not sit down beside her. "I was just going indoors."</p><p>"Please don't do that; it's much jollier here; I've ridden over fromLockleigh; it's a lovely day." His smile was peculiarly friendly andpleasing, and his whole person seemed to emit that radiance ofgood-feeling and good fare which had formed the charm of the girl'sfirst impression of him. It surrounded him like a zone of fine Juneweather.</p><p>"We'll walk about a little then," said Isabel, who could not divestherself of the sense of an intention on the part of her visitor and whowished both to elude the intention and to satisfy her curiosity aboutit. It had flashed upon her vision once before, and it had given her onthat occasion, as we know, a certain alarm. This alarm was composed ofseveral elements, not all of which were disagreeable; she had indeedspent some days in analysing them and had succeeded in separating thepleasant part of the idea of Lord Warburton's "making up" to her fromthe painful. It may appear to some readers that the young lady was bothprecipitate and unduly fastidious; but the latter of these facts, ifthe charge be true, may serve to exonerate her from the discredit ofthe former. She was not eager to convince herself that a territorialmagnate, as she had heard Lord Warburton called, was smitten with hercharms; the fact of a declaration from such a source carrying with itreally more questions than it would answer. She had received a strongimpression of his being a "personage," and she had occupied herself inexamining the image so conveyed. At the risk of adding to the evidenceof her self-sufficiency it must be said that there had been momentswhen this possibility of admiration by a personage represented to heran aggression almost to the degree of an affront, quite to the degreeof an inconvenience. She had never yet known a personage; there hadbeen no personages, in this sense, in her life; there were probablynone such at all in her native land. When she had thought of individualeminence she had thought of it on the basis of character and wit--ofwhat one might like in a gentleman's mind and in his talk. She herselfwas a character --she couldn't help being aware of that; and hithertoher visions of a completed consciousness had concerned themselveslargely with moral images--things as to which the question would bewhether they pleased her sublime soul. Lord Warburton loomed up beforeher, largely and brightly, as a collection of attributes and powerswhich were not to be measured by this simple rule, but which demanded adifferent sort of appreciation--an appreciation that the girl, with herhabit of judging quickly and freely, felt she lacked patience tobestow. He appeared to demand of her something that no one else, as itwere, had presumed to do. What she felt was that a territorial, apolitical, a social magnate had conceived the design of drawing herinto the system in which he rather invidiously lived and moved. Acertain instinct, not imperious, but persuasive, told her to resist--murmured to her that virtually she had a system and an orbit of herown. It told her other things besides--things which both contradictedand confirmed each other; that a girl might do much worse than trustherself to such a man and that it would be very interesting to seesomething of his system from his own point of view; that on the otherhand, however, there was evidently a great deal of it which she shouldregard only as a complication of every hour, and that even in the wholethere was something stiff and stupid which would make it a burden.Furthermore there was a young man lately come from America who had nosystem at all, but who had a character of which it was useless for herto try to persuade herself that the impression on her mind had beenlight. The letter she carried in her pocket all sufficiently remindedher of the contrary. Smile not, however, I venture to repeat, at thissimple young woman from Albany who debated whether she should accept anEnglish peer before he had offered himself and who was disposed tobelieve that on the whole she could do better. She was a person ofgreat good faith, and if there was a great deal of folly in her wisdomthose who judge her severely may have the satisfaction of finding that,later, she became consistently wise only at the cost of an amount offolly which will constitute almost a direct appeal to charity.</p><p>Lord Warburton seemed quite ready to walk, to sit or to do anythingthat Isabel should propose, and he gave her this assurance with hisusual air of being particularly pleased to exercise a social virtue.But he was, nevertheless, not in command of his emotions, and as hestrolled beside her for a moment, in silence, looking at her withoutletting her know it, there was something embarrassed in his glance andhis misdirected laughter. Yes, assuredly--as we have touched on thepoint, we may return to it for a moment again--the English are the mostromantic people in the world and Lord Warburton was about to give anexample of it. He was about to take a step which would astonish all hisfriends and displease a great many of them, and which had superficiallynothing to recommend it. The young lady who trod the turf beside himhad come from a queer country across the sea which he knew a good dealabout; her antecedents, her associations were very vague to his mindexcept in so far as they were generic, and in this sense they showed asdistinct and unimportant. Miss Archer had neither a fortune nor thesort of beauty that justifies a man to the multitude, and he calculatedthat he had spent about twenty-six hours in her company. He had summedup all this--the perversity of the impulse, which had declined to availitself of the most liberal opportunities to subside, and the judgementof mankind, as exemplified particularly in the more quickly-judginghalf of it: he had looked these things well in the face and then haddismissed them from his thoughts. He cared no more for them than forthe rosebud in his buttonhole. It is the good fortune of a man who forthe greater part of a lifetime has abstained without effort from makinghimself disagreeable to his friends, that when the need comes for sucha course it is not discredited by irritating associations.</p><p>"I hope you had a pleasant ride," said Isabel, who observed her companion's hesitancy.</p><p>"It would have been pleasant if for nothing else than that it brought me here."</p><p>"Are you so fond of Gardencourt?" the girl asked, more and more surethat he meant to make some appeal to her; wishing not to challenge himif he hesitated, and yet to keep all the quietness of her reason if heproceeded. It suddenly came upon her that her situation was one which afew weeks ago she would have deemed deeply romantic: the park of an oldEnglish country-house, with the foreground embellished by a "great" (asshe supposed) nobleman in the act of making love to a young lady who,on careful inspection, should be found to present remarkable analogieswith herself. But if she was now the heroine of the situation shesucceeded scarcely the less in looking at it from the outside.</p><p>"I care nothing for Gardencourt," said her companion. "I care only for you."</p><p>"You've known me too short a time to have a right to say that, and I can't believe you're serious."</p><p>These words of Isabel's were not perfectly sincere, for she had nodoubt whatever that he himself was. They were simply a tribute to thefact, of which she was perfectly aware, that those he had just utteredwould have excited surprise on the part of a vulgar world. And,moreover, if anything beside the sense she had already acquired thatLord Warburton was not a loose thinker had been needed to convince her,the tone in which he replied would quite have served the purpose.</p><p>"One's right in such a matter is not measured by the time, MissArcher; it's measured by the feeling itself. If I were to wait threemonths it would make no difference; I shall not be more sure of what Imean than I am to-day. Of course I've seen you very little, but myimpression dates from the very first hour we met. I lost no time, Ifell in love with you then. It was at first sight, as the novels say; Iknow now that's not a fancy-phrase, and I shall think better of novelsfor evermore. Those two days I spent here settled it; I don't knowwhether you suspected I was doing so, but I paid-mentally speaking Imean-- the greatest possible attention to you. Nothing you said,nothing you did, was lost upon me. When you came to Lockleigh the otherday--or rather when you went away--I was perfectly sure. Nevertheless Imade up my mind to think it over and to question myself narrowly. I'vedone so; all these days I've done nothing else. I don't make mistakesabout such things; I'm a very judicious animal. I don't go off easily,but when I'm touched, it's for life. It's for life, Miss Archer, it'sfor life," Lord Warburton repeated in the kindest, tenderest,pleasantest voice Isabel had ever heard, and looking at her with eyescharged with the light of a passion that had sifted itself clear of thebaser parts of emotion--the heat, the violence, the unreason--and thatburned as steadily as a lamp in a windless place.</p><p>By tacit consent, as he talked, they had walked more and moreslowly, and at last they stopped and he took her hand. "Ah, LordWarburton, how little you know me!" Isabel said very gently. Gently tooshe drew her hand away.</p><p>"Don't taunt me with that; that I don't know you better makes meunhappy enough already; it's all my loss. But that's what I want, andit seems to me I'm taking the best way. If you'll be my wife, then Ishall know you, and when I tell you all the good I think of you you'llnot be able to say it's from ignorance."</p><p>"If you know me little I know you even less," said Isabel.</p><p>"You mean that, unlike yourself, I may not improve on acquaintance?Ah, of course that's very possible. But think, to speak to you as I do,how determined I must be to try and give satisfaction! You do like merather, don't you?"</p><p>"I like you very much, Lord Warburton," she answered; and at this moment she liked him immensely.</p><p>"I thank you for saying that; it shows you don't regard me as astranger. I really believe I've filled all the other relations of lifevery creditably, and I don't see why I shouldn't fill this one--inwhich I offer myself to you--seeing that I care so much more about it.Ask the people who know me well; I've friends who'll speak for me."</p><p>"I don't need the recommendation of your friends," said Isabel.</p><p>"Ah now, that's delightful of you. You believe in me yourself."</p><p>"Completely," Isabel declared. She quite glowed there, inwardly, with the pleasure of feeling she did.</p><p>The light in her companion's eyes turned into a smile, and he gave along exhalation of joy. "If you're mistaken, Miss Archer, let me loseall I possess!"</p><p>She wondered whether he meant this for a reminder that he was rich,and, on the instant, felt sure that he didn't. He was thinking that, ashe would have said himself; and indeed he might safely leave it to thememory of any interlocutor, especially of one to whom he was offeringhis hand. Isabel had prayed that she might not be agitated, and hermind was tranquil enough, even while she listened and asked herselfwhat it was best she should say, to indulge in this incidentalcriticism. What she should say, had she asked herself? Her foremostwish was to say something if possible not less kind than what he hadsaid to her. His words had carried perfect conviction with them; shefelt she did, all so mysteriously, matter to him. "I thank you morethan I can say for your offer," she returned at last. "It does me greathonour."</p><p>"Ah, don't say that!" he broke out. "I was afraid you'd saysomething like that. I don't see what you've to do with that sort ofthing. I don't see why you should thank me--it's I who ought to thankyou for listening to me: a man you know so little coming down on youwith such a thumper! Of course it's a great question; I must tell youthat I'd rather ask it than have it to answer myself. But the wayyou've listened--or at least your having listened at all--gives me somehope."</p><p>"Don't hope too much," Isabel said.</p><p>"Oh Miss Archer!" her companion murmured, smiling again, in hisseriousness, as if such a warning might perhaps be taken but as theplay of high spirits, the exuberance of elation.</p><p>"Should you be greatly surprised if I were to beg you not to hope at all?" Isabel asked.</p><p>"Surprised? I don't know what you mean by surprise. It wouldn't be that; it would be a feeling very much worse."</p><p>Isabel walked on again; she was silent for some minutes. "I'm verysure that, highly as I already think of you, my opinion of you, if Ishould know you well, would only rise. But I'm by no means sure thatyou wouldn't be disappointed. And I say that not in the least out ofconventional modesty; it's perfectly sincere."</p><p>"I'm willing to risk it, Miss Archer," her companion replied.</p><p>"It's a great question, as you say. It's a very difficult question."</p><p>"I don't expect you of course to answer it outright. Think it overas long as may be necessary. If I can gain by waiting I'll gladly waita long time. Only remember that in the end my dearest happiness dependson your answer."</p><p>"I should be very sorry to keep you in suspense," said Isabel.</p><p>"Oh, don't mind. I'd much rather have a good answer six months hence than a bad one to-day."</p><p>"But it's very probable that even six months hence I shouldn't be able to give you one that you'd think good."</p><p>"Why not, since you really like me?"</p><p>"Ah, you must never doubt that," said Isabel.</p><p>"Well then, I don't see what more you ask!"</p><p>"It's not what I ask; it's what I can give. I don't think I should suit you; I really don't think I should."</p><p>"You needn't worry about that. That's my affair. You needn't be a better royalist than the king."</p><p>"It's not only that," said Isabel; "but I'm not sure I wish to marry any one."</p><p>"Very likely you don't. I've no doubt a great many women begin thatway," said his lordship, who, be it averred, did not in the leastbelieve in the axiom he thus beguiled his anxiety by uttering. "Butthey're frequently persuaded."</p><p>"Ah, that's because they want to be!" And Isabel lightly laughed.Her suitor's countenance fell, and he looked at her for a while insilence. "I'm afraid it's my being an Englishman that makes youhesitate," he said presently. "I know your uncle thinks you ought tomarry in your own country."</p><p>Isabel listened to this assertion with some interest; it had neveroccurred to her that Mr. Touchett was likely to discuss her matrimonialprospects with Lord Warburton. "Has he told you that?"</p><p>"I remember his making the remark. He spoke perhaps of Americans generally."</p><p>"He appears himself to have found it very pleasant to live inEngland." Isabel spoke in a manner that might have seemed a littleperverse, but which expressed both her constant perception of heruncle's outward felicity and her general disposition to elude anyobligation to take a restricted view.</p><p>It gave her companion hope, and he immediately cried with warmth:"Ah, my dear Miss Archer, old England's a very good sort of country,you know! And it will be still better when we've furbished it up alittle."</p><p>"Oh, don't furbish it, Lord Warburton--, leave it alone. I like it this way."</p><p>"Well then, if you like it, I'm more and more unable to see your objection to what I propose."</p><p>"I'm afraid I can't make you understand."</p><p>"You ought at least to try. I've a fair intelligence. Are youafraid--afraid of the climate? We can easily live elsewhere, you know.You can pick out your climate, the whole world over."</p><p>These words were uttered with a breadth of candour that was like theembrace of strong arms--that was like the fragrance straight in herface, and by his clean, breathing lips, of she knew not what strangegardens, what charged airs. She would have given her little finger atthat moment to feel strongly and simply the impulse to answer: "LordWarburton, it's impossible for me to do better in this wonderful world,I think, than commit myself, very gratefully, to your loyalty." Butthough she was lost in admiration of her opportunity she managed tomove back into the deepest shade of it, even as some wild, caughtcreature in a vast cage. The "splendid" security so offered her was notthe greatest she could conceive. What she finally bethought herself ofsaying was something very different--something that deferred the needof really facing her crisis. "Don't think me unkind if I ask you to sayno more about this to-day."</p><p>"Certainly, certainly!" her companion cried. "I wouldn't bore you for the world."</p><p>"You've given me a great deal to think about, and I promise you to do it justice."</p><p>"That's all I ask of you, of course--and that you'll remember how absolutely my happiness is in your hands."</p><p>Isabel listened with extreme respect to this admonition, but shesaid after a minute: "I must tell you that what I shall think about issome way of letting you know that what you ask is impossible--lettingyou know it without making you miserable."</p><p>"There's no way to do that, Miss Archer. I won't say that if yourefuse me you'll kill me; I shall not die of it. But I shall do worse;I shall live to no purpose."</p><p>"You'll live to marry a better woman than I."</p><p>"Don't say that, please," said Lord Warburton very gravely. "That's fair to neither of us."</p><p>"To marry a worse one then."</p><p>"If there are better women than you I prefer the bad ones. That'sall I can say," he went on with the same earnestness. "There's noaccounting for tastes."</p><p>His gravity made her feel equally grave, and she showed it by againrequesting him to drop the subject for the present. "I'll speak to youmyself--very soon. Perhaps I shall write to you."</p><p>"At your convenience, yes," he replied. "Whatever time you take, itmust seem to me long, and I suppose I must make the best of that."</p><p>"I shall not keep you in suspense; I only want to collect my mind a little."</p><p>He gave a melancholy sigh and stood looking at her a moment, withhis hands behind him, giving short nervous shakes to his hunting-crop."Do you know I'm very much afraid of it--of that remarkable mind ofyours?"</p><p>Our heroine's biographer can scarcely tell why, but the questionmade her start and brought a conscious blush to her cheek. She returnedhis look a moment, and then with a note in her voice that might almosthave appealed to his compassion, "So am I, my lord!" she oddlyexclaimed.</p><p>His compassion was not stirred, however; all he possessed of thefaculty of pity was needed at home. "Ah! be merciful, be merciful," hemurmured.</p><p>"I think you had better go," said Isabel. "I'll write to you."</p><p>"Very good; but whatever you write I'll come and see you, you know."And then he stood reflecting, his eyes fixed on the observantcountenance of Bunchie, who had the air of having understood all thathad been said and of pretending to carry off the indiscretion by asimulated fit of curiosity as to the roots of an ancient oak. "There'sone thing more," he went on. "You know, if you don't like Lockleigh--ifyou think it's damp or anything of that sort--you need never go withinfifty miles of it. It's not damp, by the way; I've had the housethoroughly examined; it's perfectly safe and right. But if youshouldn't fancy it you needn't dream of living in it. There's nodifficulty whatever about that; there are plenty of houses. I thoughtI'd just mention it; some people don't like a moat, you know. Good-bye."</p><p>"I adore a moat," said Isabel. "Good-bye."</p><p>He held out his hand, and she gave him hers a moment--a moment longenough for him to bend his handsome bared head and kiss it. Then, stillagitating, in his mastered emotion, his implement of the chase, hewalked rapidly away. He was evidently much upset.</p><p>Isabel herself was upset, but she had not been affected as she wouldhave imagined. What she felt was not a great responsibility, a greatdifficulty of choice; it appeared to her there had been no choice inthe question. She couldn't marry Lord Warburton; the idea failed tosupport any enlightened prejudice in favour of the free exploration oflife that she had hitherto entertained or was now capable ofentertaining. She must write this to him, she must convince him, andthat duty was comparatively simple. But what disturbed her, in thesense that it struck her with wonderment, was this very fact that itcost her so little to refuse a magnificent "chance." With whateverqualifications one would, Lord Warburton had offered her a greatopportunity; the situation might have discomforts, might containoppressive, might contain narrowing elements, might prove really but astupefying anodyne; but she did her sex no injustice in believing thatnineteen women out of twenty would have accommodated themselves to itwithout a pang. Why then upon her also should it not irresistiblyimpose itself? Who was she, what was she, that she should hold herselfsuperior? What view of life, what design upon fate, what conception ofhappiness, had she that pretended to be larger than these large thesefabulous occasions? If she wouldn't do such a thing as that then shemust do great things, she must do something greater. Poor Isabel foundground to remind herself from time to time that she must not be tooproud, and nothing could be more sincere than her prayer to bedelivered from such a danger: the isolation and loneliness of pride hadfor her mind the horror of a desert place. If it had been pride thatinterfered with her accepting Lord Warburton such a betise wassingularly misplaced; and she was so conscious of liking him that sheventured to assure herself it was the very softness, and the fineintelligence, of sympathy. She liked him too much to marry him, thatwas the truth; something assured her there was a fallacy somewhere inthe glowing logic of the proposition--as he saw it-- even though shemightn't put her very finest finger-point on it; and to inflict upon aman who offered so much a wife with a tendency to criticise would be apeculiarly discreditable act. She had promised him she would considerhis question, and when, after he had left her, she wandered back to thebench where he had found her and lost herself in meditation, it mighthave seemed that she was keeping her vow. But this was not the case;she was wondering if she were not a cold, hard, priggish person, and,on her at last getting up and going rather quickly back to the house,felt, as she had said to her friend, really frightened at herself.</p></span><span id = 962 >It was this feeling and not the wish to ask advice--she had no desire whatever for that--that led her to speak to her uncle of what had taken place. She wished to speak to some one; she should feel more natural, more human, and her uncle, for this purpose, presented himself in a more attractive light than either her aunt or her friend Henrietta. Her cousin of course was a possible confidant; but she would have had to do herself violence to air this special secret to Ralph. So the next day, after breakfast, she sought her occasion. Her uncle never left his apartment till the afternoon, but he received his cronies, as he said, in his dressing-room. Isabel had quite taken her place in the class so designated, which, for the rest, included the old man's son, his physician, his personal servant, and even Miss Stackpole. Mrs. Touchett did not figure in the list, and this was an obstacle the less to Isabel's finding her host alone. He sat in a complicated mechanical chair, at the open window of his room, looking westward over the park and the river, with his newspapers and letters piled up beside him, his toilet freshly and minutely made, and his smooth, speculative face composed to benevolent expectation.<br /><br />She approached her point directly. "I think I ought to let you know that Lord Warburton has asked me to marry him. I suppose I ought to tell my aunt; but it seems best to tell you first."<br /><br />The old man expressed no surprise, but thanked her for the confidence she showed him. "Do you mind telling me whether you accepted him?" he then enquired.<br /><br />"I've not answered him definitely yet; I've taken a little time to think of it, because that seems more respectful. But I shall not accept him."<br /><br />Mr. Touchett made no comment upon this; he had the air of thinking that, whatever interest he might take in the matter from the point of view of sociability, he had no active voice in it. "Well, I told you you'd be a success over here. Americans are highly appreciated."<br /><br />"Very highly indeed," said Isabel. "But at the cost of seeming both tasteless and ungrateful, I don't think I can marry Lord Warburton."<br /><br />"Well," her uncle went on, "of course an old man can't judge for a young lady. I'm glad you didn't ask me before you made up your mind. I suppose I ought to tell you," he added slowly, but as if it were not of much consequence, "that I've known all about it these three days."<br /><br />"About Lord Warburton's state of mind?"<br /><br />"About his intentions, as they say here. He wrote me a very pleasant letter, telling me all about them. Should you like to see his letter?" the old man obligingly asked.<br /><br />"Thank you; I don't think I care about that. But I'm glad he wrote to you; it was right that he should, and he would be certain to do what was right."<br /><br />"Ah well, I guess you do like him!" Mr. Touchett declared. "You needn't pretend you don't."<br /><br />"I like him extremely; I'm very free to admit that. But I don't wish to marry any one just now."<br /><br />"You think some one may come along whom you may like better. Well, that's very likely," said Mr. Touchett, who appeared to wish to show his kindness to the girl by easing off her decision, as it were, and finding cheerful reasons for it.<br /><br />"I don't care if I don't meet any one else. I like Lord Warburton quite well enough." she fell into that appearance of a sudden change of point of view with which she sometimes startled and even displeased her interlocutors.<br /><br />Her uncle, however, seemed proof against either of these impressions. "He's a very fine man," he resumed in a tone which might have passed for that of encouragement. "His letter was one of the pleasantest I've received for some weeks. I suppose one of the reasons I liked it was that it was all about you; that is all except the part that was about himself. I suppose he told you all that."<br /><br />"He would have told me everything I wished to ask him," Isabel said.<br /><br />"But you didn't feel curious?"<br /><br />"My curiosity would have been idle--once I had determined to decline his offer."<br /><br />"You didn't find it sufficiently attractive?" Mr. Touchett enquired.<br /><br />She was silent a little. "I suppose it was that," she presently admitted. "But I don't know why."<br /><br />"Fortunately ladies are not obliged to give reasons," said her uncle. "There's a great deal that's attractive about such an idea; but I don't see why the English should want to entice us away from our native land. I know that we try to attract them over there, but that's because our population is insufficient. Here, you know, they're rather crowded. However, I presume there's room for charming young ladies everywhere."<br /><br />"There seems to have been room here for you," said Isabel, whose eyes had been wandering over the large pleasure-spaces of the park.<br /><br />Mr. Touchett gave a shrewd, conscious smile. "There's room everywhere, my dear, if you'll pay for it. I sometimes think I've paid too much for this. Perhaps you also might have to pay too much."<br /><br />"Perhaps I might," the girl replied.<br /><br />That suggestion gave her something more definite to rest on than she had found in her own thoughts, and the fact of this association of her uncle's mild acuteness with her dilemma seemed to prove that she was concerned with the natural and reasonable emotions of life and not altogether a victim to intellectual eagerness and vague ambitions--ambitions reaching beyond Lord Warburton's beautiful appeal, reaching to something indefinable and possibly not commendable. In so far as the indefinable had an influence upon Isabel's behaviour at this juncture, it was not the conception, even unformulated, of a union with Caspar Goodwood; for however she might have resisted conquest at her English suitor's large quiet hands she was at least as far removed from the disposition to let the young man from Boston take positive possession of her. The sentiment in which She sought refuge after reading his letter was a critical view of his having come abroad; for it was part of the influence he had upon her that he seemed to deprive her of the sense of freedom. There was a disagreeably strong push, a kind of hardness of presence, in his way of rising before her. She had been haunted at moments by the image, by the danger, of his disapproval and had wondered--a consideration she had never paid in equal degree to any one else--whether he would like what she did. The difficulty was that more than any man she had ever known, more than poor Lord Warburton (she had begun now to give his lordship the benefit of this epithet), Caspar Goodwood expressed for her an energy--and she had already felt it as a power that was of his very nature. It was in no degree a matter of his "advantages"--it was a matter of the spirit that sat in his clear-burning eyes like some tireless watcher at a window. She might like it or not, but he insisted, ever, with his whole weight and force: even in one's usual contact with him one had to reckon with that. The idea of a diminished liberty was particularly disagreeable to her at present, since she had just given a sort of personal accent to her independence by looking so straight at Lord Warburton's big bribe and yet turning away from it. Sometimes Caspar Goodwood had seemed to range himself on the side of her destiny, to be the stubbornest fact she knew; she said to herself at such moments that she might evade him for a time, but that she must make terms with him at last--terms which would be certain to be favourable to himself. Her impulse had been to avail herself of the things that helped her to resist such an obligation; and this impulse had been much concerned in her eager acceptance of her aunt's invitation, which had come to her at an hour when she expected from day to day to see Mr. Goodwood and when she was glad to have an answer ready for something she was sure he would say to her. When she had told him at Albany, on the evening of Mrs. Touchett's visit, that she couldn't then discuss difficult questions, dazzled as she was by the great immediate opening of her aunt's offer of "Europe," he declared that this was no answer at all; and it was now to obtain a better one that he was following her across the sea. To say to herself that he was a kind of grim fate was well enough for a fanciful young woman who was able to take much for granted in him; but the reader has a right to a nearer and a clearer view.<br /><br />He was the son of a proprietor of well-known cotton-mills in Massachusetts--a gentleman who had accumulated a considerable fortune in the exercise of this industry. Caspar at present managed the works, and with a judgement and a temper which, in spite of keen competition and languid years, had kept their prosperity from dwindling. He had received the better part of his education at Harvard College, where, however, he had gained renown rather as a gymnast and an oarsman than as a gleaner of more dispersed knowledge. Later on he had learned that the finer intelligence too could vault and pull and strain--might even, breaking the record, treat itself to rare exploits. He had thus discovered in himself a sharp eye for the mystery of mechanics, and had invented an improvement in the cotton-spinning process which was now largely used and was known by his name. You might have seen it in the newspapers in connection with this fruitful contrivance; assurance of which he had given to Isabel by showing her in the columns of the New York Interviewer an exhaustive article on the Goodwood patent--an article not prepared by Miss Stackpole, friendly as she had proved herself to his more sentimental interests. There were intricate, bristling things he rejoiced in; he liked to organise, to contend, to administer; he could make people work his will, believe in him, march before him and justify him. This was the art, as they said, of managing men --which rested, in him, further, on a bold though brooding ambition. It struck those who knew him well that he might do greater things than carry on a cotton-factory; there was nothing cottony about Caspar Goodwood, and his friends took for granted that he would somehow and somewhere write himself in bigger letters. But it was as if something large and confused, something dark and ugly, would have to call upon him: he was not after all in harmony with mere smug peace and greed and gain, an order of things of which the vital breath was ubiquitous advertisement. It pleased Isabel to believe that he might have ridden, on a plunging steed, the whirlwind of a great war--a war like the Civil strife that had overdarkened her conscious childhood and his ripening youth.<br /><br />She liked at any rate this idea of his being by character and in fact a mover of men--liked it much better than some other points in his nature and aspect. She cared nothing for his cotton-mill-- the Goodwood patent left her imagination absolutely cold. She wished him no ounce less of his manhood, but she sometimes thought he would be rather nicer if he looked, for instance, a little differently. His jaw was too square and set and his figure too straight and stiff: these things suggested a want of easy consonance with the deeper rhythms of life. Then she viewed with reserve a habit he had of dressing always in the same manner; it was not apparently that he wore the same clothes continually, for, on the contrary, his garments had a way of looking rather too new. But they all seemed of the same piece; the figure, the stuff, was so drearily usual. She had reminded herself more than once that this was a frivolous objection to a person of his importance; and then she had amended the rebuke by saying that it would be a frivolous objection only if she were in love with him. She was not in love with him and therefore might criticise his small defects as well as his great--which latter consisted in the collective reproach of his being too serious, or, rather, not of his being so, since one could never be, but certainly of his seeming so. He showed his appetites and designs too simply and artlessly; when one was alone with him he talked too much about the same subject, and when other people were present he talked too little about anything. And yet he was of supremely strong, clean make--which was so much she saw the different fitted parts of him as she had seen, in museums and portraits, the different fitted parts of armoured warriors--in plates of steel handsomely inlaid with gold. It was very strange: where, ever, was any tangible link between her impression and her act? Caspar Goodwood had never corresponded to her idea of a delightful person, and she supposed that this was why he left her so harshly critical. When, however, Lord Warburton, who not only did correspond with it, but gave an extension to the term, appealed to her approval, she found herself still unsatisfied. It was certainly strange.<br /><br />The sense of her incoherence was not a help to answering Mr. Goodwood's letter, and Isabel determined to leave it a while unhonoured. If he had determined to persecute her he must take the consequences; foremost among which was his being left to perceive how little it charmed her that he should come down to Gardencourt. She was already liable to the incursions of one suitor at this place, and though it might be pleasant to be appreciated in opposite quarters there was a kind of grossness in entertaining two such passionate pleaders at once, even in a case where the entertainment should consist of dismissing them. She made no reply to Mr. Goodwood; but at the end of three days she wrote to Lord Warburton, and the letter belongs to our history.<br /><br />DEAR LORD WARBURTON--A great deal of earnest thought has not led me to change my mind about the suggestion you were so kind as to make me the other day. I am not, I am really and truly not, able to regard you in the light of a companion for life; or to think of your home--your various homes--as the settled seat of my existence. These things cannot be reasoned about, and I very earnestly entreat you not to return to the subject we discussed so exhaustively. We see our lives from our own point of view; that is the privilege of the weakest and humblest of us; and I shall never be able to see mine in the manner you proposed. Kindly let this suffice you, and do me the justice to believe that I have given your proposal the deeply respectful consideration it deserves. It is with this very great regard that I remain sincerely yours,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ISABEL ARCHER.<br /><br />While the author of this missive was making up her mind to dispatch it Henrietta Stackpole formed a resolve which was accompanied by no demur. She invited Ralph Touchett to take a walk with her in the garden, and when he had assented with that alacrity which seemed constantly to testify to his high expectations, she informed him that she had a favour to ask of him. It may be admitted that at this information the young man flinched; for we know that Miss Stackpole had struck him as apt to push an advantage. The alarm was unreasoned, however; for he was clear about the area of her indiscretion as little as advised of its vertical depth, and he made a very civil profession of the desire to serve her. He was afraid of her and presently told her so. "When you look at me in a certain way my knees knock together, my faculties desert me; I'm filled with trepidation and I ask only for strength to execute your commands. You've an address that I've never encountered in any woman."<br /><br />"Well," Henrietta replied good-humouredly, "if I had not known before that you were trying somehow to abash me I should know it now. Of course I'm easy game--I was brought up with such different customs and ideas. I'm not used to your arbitrary standards, and I've never been spoken to in America as you have spoken to me. If a gentleman conversing with me over there were to speak to me like that I shouldn't know what to make of it. We take everything more naturally over there, and, after all, we're a great deal more simple. I admit that; I'm very simple myself. Of course if you choose to laugh at me for it you're very welcome; but I think on the whole I would rather be myself than you. I'm quite content to be myself; I don't want to change. There are plenty of people that appreciate me just as I am. It's true they're nice fresh free-born Americans!" Henrietta had lately taken up the tone of helpless innocence and large concession. "I want you to assist me a little," she went on. "I don't care in the least whether I amuse you while you do so; or, rather, I'm perfectly willing your amusement should be your reward. I want you to help me about Isabel."<br /><br />"Has she injured you?" Ralph asked.<br /><br />"If she had I shouldn't mind, and I should never tell you. What I'm afraid of is that she'll injure herself."<br /><br />"I think that's very possible," said Ralph.<br /><br />His companion stopped in the garden-walk, fixing on him perhaps the very gaze that unnerved him. "That too would amuse you, I suppose. The way you do say things! I never heard any one so indifferent."<br /><br />"To Isabel? Ah, not that!"<br /><br />"Well, you're not in love with her, I hope."<br /><br />"How can that be, when I'm in love with Another?"<br /><br />"You're in love with yourself, that's the Other!" Miss Stackpole declared. "Much good may it do you! But if you wish to be serious once in your life here's a chance; and if you really care for your cousin here's an opportunity to prove it. I don't expect you to understand her; that's too much to ask. But you needn't do that to grant my favour. I'll supply the necessary intelligence."<br /><br />"I shall enjoy that immensely!" Ralph exclaimed. "I'll be Caliban and you shall be Ariel."<br /><br />"You're not at all like Caliban, because you're sophisticated, and Caliban was not. But I'm not talking about imaginary characters; I'm talking about Isabel. Isabel's intensely real. What I wish to tell you is that I find her fearfully changed."<br /><br />"Since you came, do you mean?"<br /><br />"Since I came and before I came. She's not the same as she once so beautifully was."<br /><br />"As she was in America?"<br /><br />"Yes, in America. I suppose you know she comes from there. She can't help it, but she does."<br /><br />"Do you want to change her back again?"<br /><br />"Of course I do, and I want you to help me."<br /><br />"Ah," said Ralph, "I'm only Caliban; I'm not Prospero."<br /><br />"You were Prospero enough to make her what she has become. You've acted on Isabel Archer since she came here, Mr. Touchett."<br /><br />"I, my dear Miss Stackpole? Never in the world. Isabel Archer has acted on me--yes; she acts on every one. But I've been absolutely passive."<br /><br />"You're too passive then. You had better stir yourself and be careful. Isabel's changing every day; she's drifting away-- right out to sea. I've watched her and I can see it. She's not the bright American girl she was. She's taking different views, a different colour, and turning away from her old ideals. I want to save those ideals, Mr. Touchett, and that's where you come in."<br /><br />"Not surely as an ideal?"<br /><br />"Well, I hope not," Henrietta replied promptly. "I've got a fear in my heart that she's going to marry one of these fell Europeans, and I want to prevent it.<br /><br />"Ah, I see," cried Ralph; "and to prevent it you want me to step in and marry her?"<br /><br />"Not quite; that remedy would be as bad as the disease, for you're the typical, the fell European from whom I wish to rescue her. No; I wish you to take an interest in another person-- a young man to whom she once gave great encouragement and whom she now doesn't seem to think good enough. He's a thoroughly grand man and a very dear friend of mine, and I wish very much you would invite him to pay a visit here."<br /><br />Ralph was much puzzled by this appeal, and it is perhaps not to the credit of his purity of mind that he failed to look at it at first in the simplest light. It wore, to his eyes, a tortuous air, and his fault was that he was not quite sure that anything in the world could really be as candid as this request of Miss Stackpole's appeared. That a young woman should demand that a gentleman whom she described as her very dear friend should be furnished with an opportunity to make himself agreeable to another young woman, a young woman whose attention had wandered and whose charms were greater--this was an anomaly which for the moment challenged all his ingenuity of interpretation. To read between the lines was easier than to follow the text, and to suppose that Miss Stackpole wished the gentleman invited to Gardencourt on her own account was the sign not so much of a vulgar as of an embarrassed mind. Even from this venial act of vulgarity, however, Ralph was saved, and saved by a force that I can only speak of as inspiration. With no more outward light on the subject than he already possessed he suddenly acquired the conviction that it would be a sovereign injustice to the correspondent of the Interviewer to assign a dishonourable motive to any act of hers. This conviction passed into his mind with extreme rapidity; it was perhaps kindled by the pure radiance of the young lady's imperturbable gaze. He returned this challenge a moment, consciously, resisting an inclination to frown as one frowns in the presence of larger luminaries. "Who's the gentleman you speak of?"<br /><br />"Mr. Caspar Goodwood--of Boston. He has been extremely attentive to Isabel--just as devoted to her as he can live. He has followed her out here and he's at present in London. I don't know his address, but I guess I can obtain it."<br /><br />"I've never heard of him," said Ralph.<br /><br />"Well, I suppose you haven't heard of every one. I don't believe he has ever heard of you; but that's no reason why Isabel shouldn't marry him."<br /><br />Ralph gave a mild ambiguous laugh. "What a rage you have for marrying people! Do you remember how you wanted to marry me the other day?"<br /><br />"I've got over that. You don't know how to take such ideas. Mr. Goodwood does, however; and that's what I like about him. He's a splendid man and a perfect gentleman, and Isabel knows it."<br /><br />"Is she very fond of him?"<br /><br />"If she isn't she ought to be. He's simply wrapped up in her."<br /><br />"And you wish me to ask him here," said Ralph reflectively.<br /><br />"It would be an act of true hospitality."<br /><br />"Caspar Goodwood," Ralph continued--"it's rather a striking name."<br /><br />"I don't care anything about his name. It might be Ezekiel Jenkins, and I should say the same. He's the only man I have ever seen whom I think worthy of Isabel."<br /><br />"You're a very devoted friend," said Ralph.<br /><br />"Of course I am. If you say that to pour scorn on me I don't care."<br /><br />"I don't say it to pour scorn on you; I'm very much struck with it."<br /><br />"You're more satiric than ever, but I advise you not to laugh at Mr. Goodwood."<br /><br />"I assure you I'm very serious; you ought to understand that," said Ralph.<br /><br />In a moment his companion understood it. "I believe you are; now you're too serious."<br /><br />"You're difficult to please."<br /><br />"Oh, you're very serious indeed. You won't invite Mr. Goodwood."<br /><br />"I don't know," said Ralph. "I'm capable of strange things. Tell me a little about Mr. Goodwood. What's he like?"<br /><br />"He's just the opposite of you. He's at the head of a cotton-factory; a very fine one."<br /><br />"Has he pleasant manners?" asked Ralph.<br /><br />"Splendid manners--in the American style."<br /><br />"Would he be an agreeable member of our little circle?"<br /><br />"I don't think he'd care much about our little circle. He'd concentrate on Isabel."<br /><br />"And how would my cousin like that?"<br /><br />"Very possibly not at all. But it will be good for her. It will call back her thoughts."<br /><br />"Call them back--from where?"<br /><br />"From foreign parts and other unnatural places. Three months ago she gave Mr. Goodwood every reason to suppose he was acceptable to her, and it's not worthy of Isabel to go back on a real friend simply because she has changed the scene. I've changed the scene too, and the effect of it has been to make me care more for my old associations than ever. It's my belief that the sooner Isabel changes it back again the better. I know her well enough to know that she would never be truly happy over here, and I wish her to form some strong American tie that will act as a preservative."<br /><br />"Aren't you perhaps a little too much in a hurry?" Ralph enquired. "Don't you think you ought to give her more of a chance in poor old England?"<br /><br />"A chance to ruin her bright young life? One's never too much in a hurry to save a precious human creature from drowning."<br /><br />"As I understand it then," said Ralph, "you wish me to push Mr. Goodwood overboard after her. Do you know," he added, "that I've never heard her mention his name?"<br /><br />Henrietta gave a brilliant smile. "I'm delighted to hear that; it proves how much she thinks of him."<br /><br />Ralph appeared to allow that there was a good deal in this, and he surrendered to thought while his companion watched him askance. "If I should invite Mr. Goodwood," he finally said, "it would be to quarrel with him."<br /><br />"Don't do that; he'd prove the better man."<br /><br />"You certainly are doing your best to make me hate him! I really don't think I can ask him. I should be afraid of being rude to him."<br /><br />"It's just as you please," Henrietta returned. "I had no idea you were in love with her yourself."<br /><br />"Do you really believe that?" the young man asked with lifted eyebrows.<br /><br />"That's the most natural speech I've ever heard you make! Of course I believe it," Miss Stackpole ingeniously said.<br /><br />"Well," Ralph concluded, "to prove to you that you're wrong I'll invite him. It must be of course as a friend of yours."<br /><br />"It will not be as a friend of mine that he'll come; and it will not be to prove to me that I'm wrong that you'll ask him--but to prove it to yourself!"<br /><br />These last words of Miss Stackpole's (on which the two presently separated) contained an amount of truth which Ralph Touchett was obliged to recognise; but it so far took the edge from too sharp a recognition that, in spite of his suspecting it would be rather more indiscreet to keep than to break his promise, he wrote Mr. Goodwood a note of six lines, expressing the pleasure it would give Mr. Touchett the elder that he should join a little party at Gardencourt, of which Miss Stackpole was a valued member. Having sent his letter (to the care of a banker whom Henrietta suggested) he waited in some suspense. He had heard this fresh formidable figure named for the first time; for when his mother had mentioned on her arrival that there was a story about the girl's having an "admirer" at home, the idea had seemed deficient in reality and he had taken no pains to ask questions the answers to which would involve only the vague or the disagreeable. Now, however, the native admiration of which his cousin was the object had become more concrete; it took the form of a young man who had followed her to London, who was interested in a cotton-mill and had manners in the most splendid of the American styles. Ralph had two theories about this intervenes. Either his passion was a sentimental fiction of Miss Stackpole's (there was always a sort of tacit understanding among women, born of the solidarity of the sex, that they should discover or invent lovers for each other), in which case he was not to be feared and would probably not accept the invitation; or else he would accept the invitation and in this event prove himself a creature too irrational to demand further consideration. The latter clause of Ralph's argument might have seemed incoherent; but it embodied his conviction that if Mr. Goodwood were interested in Isabel in the serious manner described by Miss Stackpole he would not care to present himself at Gardencourt on a summons from the latter lady. "On this supposition," said Ralph, "he must regard her as a thorn on the stem of his rose; as an intercessor he must find her wanting in tact."<br /><br />Two days after he had sent his invitation he received a very short note from Caspar Goodwood, thanking him for it, regretting that other engagements made a visit to Gardencourt impossible and presenting many compliments to Miss Stackpole. Ralph handed the note to Henrietta, who, when she had read it, exclaimed: "Well, I never have heard of anything so stiff!"<br /><br />"I'm afraid he doesn't care so much about my cousin as you suppose," Ralph observed.<br /><br />"No, it's not that; it's some subtler motive. His nature's very deep. But I'm determined to fathom it, and I shall write to him to know what he means."<br /><br />His refusal of Ralph's overtures was vaguely disconcerting; from the moment he declined to come to Gardencourt our friend began to think him of importance. He asked himself what it signified to him whether Isabel's admirers should be desperadoes or laggards; they were not rivals of his and were perfectly welcome to act out their genius. Nevertheless he felt much curiosity as to the result of Miss Stackpole's promised enquiry into the causes of Mr. Goodwood's stiffness--a curiosity for the present ungratified, inasmuch as when he asked her three days later if she had written to London she was obliged to confess she had written in vain. Mr. Goodwood had not replied.<br /><br />"I suppose he's thinking it over," she said; "he thinks everything over; he's not really at all impetuous. But I'm accustomed to having my letters answered the same day." She presently proposed to Isabel, at all events, that they should make an excursion to London together. "If I must tell the truth," she observed, "I'm not seeing much at this place, and I shouldn't think you were either. I've not even seen that aristocrat-- what's his name?--Lord Washburton. He seems to let you severely alone."<br /><br />"Lord Warburton's coming to-morrow, I happen to know," replied her friend, who had received a note from the master of Lockleigh in answer to her own letter. "You'll have every opportunity of turning him inside out."<br /><br />"Well, he may do for one letter, but what's one letter when you want to write fifty? I've described all the scenery in this vicinity and raved about all the old women and donkeys. You may say what you please, scenery doesn't make a vital letter. I must go back to London and get some impressions of real life. I was there but three days before I came away, and that's hardly time to get in touch."<br /><br />As Isabel, on her journey from New York to Gardencourt, had seen even less of the British capital than this, it appeared a happy suggestion of Henrietta's that the two should go thither on a visit of pleasure. The idea struck Isabel as charming; he was curious of the thick detail of London, which had always loomed large and rich to her. They turned over their schemes together and indulged in visions of romantic hours. They would stay at some picturesque old inn--one of the inns described by Dickens-- and drive over the town in those delightful hansoms. Henrietta was a literary woman, and the great advantage of being a literary woman was that you could go everywhere and do everything. They would dine at a coffee-house and go afterwards to the play; they would frequent the Abbey and the British Museum and find out where Doctor Johnson had lived, and Goldsmith and Addison. Isabel grew eager and presently unveiled the bright vision to Ralph, who burst into a fit of laughter which scarce expressed the sympathy she had desired.<br /><br />"It's a delightful plan," he said. "I advise you to go to the Duke's Head in Covent Garden, an easy, informal, old-fashioned place, and I'll have you put down at my club."<br /><br />"Do you mean it's improper?" Isabel asked. "Dear me, isn't anything proper here? With Henrietta surely I may go anywhere; she isn't hampered in that way. She has travelled over the whole American continent and can at least find her way about this minute island."<br /><br />"Ah then," said Ralph, "let me take advantage of her protection to go up to town as well. I may never have a chance to travel so safely!"<br /><br /></span><span id = 963 >Miss Stackpole would have prepared to start immediately; but Isabel, as we have seen, had been notified that Lord Warburton would come again to Gardencourt, and she believed it her duty to remain there and see him. For four or five days he had made no response to her letter; then he had written, very briefly, to say he would come to luncheon two days later. There was something in these delays and postponements that touched the girl and renewed her sense of his desire to be considerate and patient, not to appear to urge her too grossly; a consideration the more studied that she was so sure he "really liked" her. Isabel told her uncle she had written to him, mentioning also his intention of coming; and the old man, in consequence, left his room earlier than usual and made his appearance at the two o'clock repast. This was by no means an act of vigilance on his part, but the fruit of a benevolent belief that his being of the company might help to cover any conjoined straying away in case Isabel should give their noble visitor another hearing. That personage drove over from Lockleigh and brought the elder of his sisters with him, a measure presumably dictated by reflexions of the same order as Mr. Touchett's. The two visitors were introduced to Miss Stackpole, who, at luncheon, occupied a seat adjoining Lord Warburton's. Isabel, who was nervous and had no relish for the prospect of again arguing the question he had so prematurely opened, could not help admiring his good-humoured self-possession, which quite disguised the symptoms of that preoccupation with her presence it was natural she should suppose him to feel. He neither looked at her nor spoke to her, and the only sign of his emotion was that he avoided meeting her eyes. He had plenty of talk for the others, however, and he appeared to eat his luncheon with discrimination and appetite. Miss Molyneux, who had a smooth, nun-like forehead and wore a large silver cross suspended from her neck, was evidently preoccupied with Henrietta Stackpole, upon whom her eyes constantly rested in a manner suggesting a conflict between deep alienation and yearning wonder. Of the two ladies from Lockleigh she was the one Isabel had liked best; there was such a world of hereditary quiet in her. Isabel was sure moreover that her mild forehead and silver cross referred to some weird Anglican mystery--some delightful reinstitution perhaps of the quaint office of the canoness. She wondered what Miss Molyneux would think of her if she knew Miss Archer had refused her brother; and then she felt sure that Miss Molyneux would never know--that Lord Warburton never told her such things. He was fond of her and kind to her, but on the whole he told her little. Such, at least, was Isabel's theory; when, at table, she was not occupied in conversation she was usually occupied in forming theories about her neighbours. According to Isabel, if Miss Molyneux should ever learn what had passed between Miss Archer and Lord Warburton she would probably be shocked at such a girl's failure to rise; or no, rather (this was our heroine's last position) she would impute to the young American but a due consciousness of inequality.<br /><br />Whatever Isabel might have made of her opportunities, at all events, Henrietta Stackpole was by no means disposed to neglect those in which she now found herself immersed. "Do you know you're the first lord I've ever seen?" she said very promptly to her neighbour. "I suppose you think I'm awfully benighted."<br /><br />"You've escaped seeing some very ugly men," Lord Warburton answered, looking a trifle absently about the table.<br /><br />"Are they very ugly? They try to make us believe in America that they're all handsome and magnificent and that they wear wonderful robes and crowns."<br /><br />"Ah, the robes and crowns are gone out of fashion," said Lord Warburton, "like your tomahawks and revolvers."<br /><br />"I'm sorry for that; I think an aristocracy ought to be splendid," Henrietta declared. "If it's not that, what is it?"<br /><br />"Oh, you know, it isn't much, at the best," her neighbour allowed. "Won't you have a potato?"<br /><br />"I don't care much for these European potatoes. I shouldn't know you from an ordinary American gentleman."<br /><br />"Do talk to me as if I were one," said Lord Warburton. "I don't see how you manage to get on without potatoes; you must find so few things to eat over here."<br /><br />Henrietta was silent a little; there was a chance he was not sincere. "I've had hardly any appetite since I've been here," she went on at last; "so it doesn't much matter. I don't approve of you, you know; I feel as if I ought to tell you that."<br /><br />"Don't approve of me?"<br /><br />"Yes; I don't suppose any one ever said such a thing to you before, did they? I don't approve of lords as an institution. I think the world has got beyond them--far beyond."<br /><br />"Oh, so do I. I don't approve of myself in the least. Sometimes it comes over me--how I should object to myself if I were not myself, don't you know? But that's rather good, by the way--not to be vainglorious."<br /><br />"Why don't you give it up then?" Miss Stackpole enquired.<br /><br />"Give up--a--?" asked Lord Warburton, meeting her harsh inflexion with a very mellow one.<br /><br />"Give up being a lord."<br /><br />"Oh, I'm so little of one! One would really forget all about it if you wretched Americans were not constantly reminding one. However, I do think of giving it up, the little there is left of it, one of these days."<br /><br />"I should like to see you do it!" Henrietta exclaimed rather grimly.<br /><br />"I'll invite you to the ceremony; we'll have a supper and a dance."<br /><br />"Well," said Miss Stackpole, "I like to see all sides. I don't approve of a privileged class, but I like to hear what they have to say for themselves."<br /><br />"Mighty little, as you see!"<br /><br />"I should like to draw you out a little more," Henrietta continued. "But you're always looking away. You're afraid of meeting my eye. I see you want to escape me."<br /><br />"No, I'm only looking for those despised potatoes."<br /><br />"Please explain about that young lady--your sister--then. I don't understand about her. Is she a Lady?"<br /><br />"She's a capital good girl."<br /><br />"I don't like the way you say that--as if you wanted to change the subject. Is her position inferior to yours?"<br /><br />"We neither of us have any position to speak of; but she's better off than I, because she has none of the bother."<br /><br />"Yes, she doesn't look as if she had much bother. I wish I had as little bother as that. You do produce quiet people over here, whatever else you may do."<br /><br />"Ah, you see one takes life easily, on the whole," said Lord Warburton. "And then you know we're very dull. Ah, we can be dull when we try!"<br /><br />"I should advise you to try something else. I shouldn't know what to talk to your sister about; she looks so different. Is that silver cross a badge?"<br /><br />"A badge?"<br /><br />"A sign of rank."<br /><br />Lord Warburton's glance had wandered a good deal, but at this it met the gaze of his neighbour. "Oh yes," he answered in a moment; "the women go in for those things. The silver cross is worn by the eldest daughters of Viscounts." Which was his harmless revenge for having occasionally had his credulity too easily engaged in America. After luncheon he proposed to Isabel to come into the gallery and look at the pictures; and though she knew he had seen the pictures twenty times she complied without criticising this pretext. Her conscience now was very easy; ever since she sent him her letter she had felt particularly light of spirit. He walked slowly to the end of the gallery, staring at its contents and saying nothing; and then he suddenly broke out: "I hoped you wouldn't write to me that way."<br /><br />"It was the only way, Lord Warburton," said the girl. "Do try and believe that."<br /><br />"If I could believe it of course I should let you alone. But we can't believe by willing it; and I confess I don't understand. I could understand your disliking me; that I could understand well. But that you should admit you do--"<br /><br />"What have I admitted?" Isabel interrupted, turning slightly pale.<br /><br />"That you think me a good fellow; isn't that it?" She said nothing, and he went on: "You don't seem to have any reason, and that gives me a sense of injustice."<br /><br />"I have a reason, Lord Warburton." She said it in a tone that made his heart contract.<br /><br />"I should like very much to know it."<br /><br />"I'll tell you some day when there's more to show for it."<br /><br />"Excuse my saying that in the mean time I must doubt of it."<br /><br />"You make me very unhappy," said Isabel.<br /><br />"I'm not sorry for that; it may help you to know how I feel. Will you kindly answer me a question?" Isabel made no audible assent, but he apparently saw in her eyes something that gave him courage to go on. "Do you prefer some one else?"<br /><br />"That's a question I'd rather not answer."<br /><br />"Ah, you do then!" her suitor murmured with bitterness.<br /><br />The bitterness touched her, and she cried out: "You're mistaken! I don't."<br /><br />He sat down on a bench, unceremoniously, doggedly, like a man in trouble; leaning his elbows on his knees and staring at the floor. "I can't even be glad of that," he said at last, throwing himself back against the wall; "for that would be an excuse."<br /><br />She raised her eyebrows in surprise. "An excuse? Must I excuse myself?"<br /><br />He paid, however, no answer to the question. Another idea had come into his head. "Is it my political opinions? Do you think I go too far?"<br /><br />"I can't object to your political opinions, because I don't understand them."<br /><br />"You don't care what I think!" he cried, getting up. "It's all the same to you."<br /><br />Isabel walked to the other side of the gallery and stood there showing him her charming back, her light slim figure, the length of her white neck as she bent her head, and the density of her dark braids. She stopped in front of a small picture as if for the purpose of examining it; and there was something so young and free in her movement that her very pliancy seemed to mock at him. Her eyes, however, saw nothing; they had suddenly been suffused with tears. In a moment he followed her, and by this time she had brushed her tears away; but when she turned round her face was pale and the expression of her eyes strange. "That reason that I wouldn't tell you--I'll tell it you after all. It's that I can't escape my fate."<br /><br />"Your fate?"<br /><br />"I should try to escape it if I were to marry you."<br /><br />"I don't understand. Why should not that be your fate as well as anything else?"<br /><br />"Because it's not," said Isabel femininely. "I know it's not. It's not my fate to give up--I know it can't be."<br /><br />Poor Lord Warburton stared, an interrogative point in either eye. "Do you call marrying me giving up?"<br /><br />"Not in the usual sense. It's getting--getting--getting a great deal. But it's giving up other chances."<br /><br />"Other chances for what?"<br /><br />"I don't mean chances to marry," said Isabel, her colour quickly coming back to her. And then she stopped, looking down with a deep frown, as if it were hopeless to attempt to make her meaning clear.<br /><br />"I don't think it presumptuous in me to suggest that you'll gain more than you'll lose," her companion observed.<br /><br />"I can't escape unhappiness," said Isabel. "In marrying you I shall be trying to."<br /><br />"I don't know whether you'd try to, but you certainly would: that I must in candour admit!" he exclaimed with an anxious laugh.<br /><br />"I mustn't--I can't!" cried the girl.<br /><br />"Well, if you're bent on being miserable I don't see why you should make me so. Whatever charms a life of misery may have for you, it has none for me."<br /><br />"I'm not bent on a life of misery," said Isabel. "I've always been intensely determined to be happy, and I've often believed I should be. I've told people that; you can ask them. But it comes over me every now and then that I can never be happy in any extraordinary way; not by turning away, by separating myself."<br /><br />"By separating yourself from what?"<br /><br />"From life. From the usual chances and dangers, from what most people know and suffer."<br /><br />Lord Warburton broke into a smile that almost denoted hope. "Why, my dear Miss Archer," he began to explain with the most considerate eagerness, "I don't offer you any exoneration from life or from any chances or dangers whatever. I wish I could; depend upon it I would! For what do you take me, pray? Heaven help me, I'm not the Emperor of China! All I offer you is the chance of taking the common lot in a comfortable sort of way. The common lot? Why, I'm devoted to the common lot! Strike an alliance with me, and I promise you that you shall have plenty of it. You shall separate from nothing whatever--not even from your friend Miss Stackpole."<br /><br />"She'd never approve of it," said Isabel, trying to smile and take advantage of this side-issue; despising herself too, not a little, for doing so.<br /><br />"Are we speaking of Miss Stackpole?" his lordship asked impatiently. "I never saw a person judge things on such theoretic grounds."<br /><br />"Now I suppose you're speaking of me," said Isabel with humility; and she turned away again, for she saw Miss Molyneux enter the gallery, accompanied by Henrietta and by Ralph.<br /><br />Lord Warburton's sister addressed him with a certain timidity and reminded him she ought to return home in time for tea, as she was expecting company to partake of it. He made no answer--apparently not having heard her; he was preoccupied, and with good reason. Miss Molyneux--as if he had been Royalty--stood like a lady-in-waiting.<br /><br />"Well, I never, Miss Molyneux!" said Henrietta Stackpole. "If I wanted to go he'd have to go. If I wanted my brother to do a thing he'd have to do it."<br /><br />"Oh, Warburton does everything one wants," Miss Molyneux answered with a quick, shy laugh. "How very many pictures you have!" she went on, turning to Ralph.<br /><br />"They look a good many, because they're all put together," said Ralph. "But it's really a bad way."<br /><br />"Oh, I think it's so nice. I wish we had a gallery at Lockleigh. I'm so very fond of pictures," Miss Molyneux went on, persistently, to Ralph, as if she were afraid Miss Stackpole would address her again. Henrietta appeared at once to fascinate and to frighten her.<br /><br />"Ah yes, pictures are very convenient," said Ralph, who appeared to know better what style of reflexion was acceptable to her.<br /><br />"They're so very pleasant when it rains," the young lady continued. "It has rained of late so very often."<br /><br />"I'm sorry you're going away, Lord Warburton," said Henrietta. "I wanted to get a great deal more out of you."<br /><br />"I'm not going away," Lord Warburton answered.<br /><br />"Your sister says you must. In America the gentlemen obey the ladies."<br /><br />"I'm afraid we have some people to tea," said Miss Molyneux, looking at her brother.<br /><br />"Very good, my dear. We'll go."<br /><br />"I hoped you would resist!" Henrietta exclaimed. "I wanted to see what Miss Molyneux would do."<br /><br />"I never do anything," said this young lady.<br /><br />"I suppose in your position it's sufficient for you to exist!" Miss Stackpole returned. "I should like very much to see you at home."<br /><br />"You must come to Lockleigh again," said Miss Molyneux, very sweetly, to Isabel, ignoring this remark of Isabel's friend. Isabel looked into her quiet eyes a moment, and for that moment seemed to see in their grey depths the reflexion of everything she had rejected in rejecting Lord Warburton--the peace, the kindness, the honour, the possessions, a deep security and a great exclusion. She kissed Miss Molyneux and then she said: "I'm afraid I can never come again."<br /><br />"Never again?"<br /><br />"I'm afraid I'm going away."<br /><br />"Oh, I'm so very sorry," said Miss Molyneux. "I think that's so very wrong of you."<br /><br />Lord Warburton watched this little passage; then he turned away and stared at a picture. Ralph, leaning against the rail before the picture with his hands in his pockets, had for the moment been watching him.<br /><br />"I should like to see you at home," said Henrietta, whom Lord Warburton found beside him. "I should like an hour's talk with you; there are a great many questions I wish to ask you."<br /><br />"I shall be delighted to see you," the proprietor of Lockleigh answered; "but I'm certain not to be able to answer many of your questions. When will you come?"<br /><br />"Whenever Miss Archer will take me. We're thinking of going to London, but we'll go and see you first. I'm determined to get some satisfaction out of you."<br /><br />"If it depends upon Miss Archer I'm afraid you won't get much. She won't come to Lockleigh; she doesn't like the place."<br /><br />"She told me it was lovely!" said Henrietta.<br /><br />Lord Warburton hesitated. "She won't come, all the same. You had better come alone," he added.<br /><br />Henrietta straightened herself, and her large eyes expanded. "Would you make that remark to an English lady?" she enquired with soft asperity.<br /><br />Lord Warburton stared. "Yes, if I liked her enough."<br /><br />"You'd be careful not to like her enough. If Miss Archer won't visit your place again it's because she doesn't want to take me. I know what she thinks of me, and I suppose you think the same-- that I oughtn't to bring in individuals." Lord Warburton was at a loss; he had not been made acquainted with Miss Stackpole's professional character and failed to catch her allusion. "Miss Archer has been warning you!" she therefore went on.<br /><br />"Warning me?"<br /><br />"Isn't that why she came off alone with you here--to put you on your guard?"<br /><br />"Oh dear, no," said Lord Warburton brazenly; "our talk had no such solemn character as that."<br /><br />"Well, you've been on your guard--intensely. I suppose it's natural to you; that's just what I wanted to observe. And so, too, Miss Molyneux--she wouldn't commit herself. You have been warned, anyway," Henrietta continued, addressing this young lady; "but for you it wasn't necessary."<br /><br />"I hope not," said Miss Molyneux vaguely.<br /><br />"Miss Stackpole takes notes," Ralph soothingly explained. "She's a great satirist; she sees through us all and she works us up."<br /><br />"Well, I must say I never have had such a collection of bad material!" Henrietta declared, looking from Isabel to Lord Warburton and from this nobleman to his sister and to Ralph. "There's something the matter with you all; you're as dismal as if you had got a bad cable."<br /><br />"You do see through us, Miss Stackpole," said Ralph in a low tone, giving her a little intelligent nod as he led the party out of the gallery. "There's something the matter with us all."<br /><br />Isabel came behind these two; Miss Molyneux, who decidedly liked her immensely, had taken her arm, to walk beside her over the polished floor. Lord Warburton strolled on the other side with his hands behind him and his eyes lowered. For some moments he said nothing; and then, "Is it true you're going to London?" he asked.<br /><br />"I believe it has been arranged."<br /><br />"And when shall you come back?"<br /><br />"In a few days; but probably for a very short time. I'm going to Paris with my aunt."<br /><br />"When, then, shall I see you again?"<br /><br />"Not for a good while," said Isabel. "But some day or other, I hope."<br /><br />"Do you really hope it?"<br /><br />"Very much."<br /><br />He went a few steps in silence; then he stopped and put out his hand. "Good-bye."<br /><br />"Good-bye," said Isabel.<br /><br />Miss Molyneux kissed her again, and she let the two depart. After it, without rejoining Henrietta and Ralph, she retreated to her own room; in which apartment, before dinner, she was found by Mrs. Touchett, who had stopped on her way to the salon. "I may as well tell you," said that lady, "that your uncle has informed me of your relations with Lord Warburton."<br /><br />Isabel considered. "Relations? They're hardly relations. That's the strange part of it: he has seen me but three or four times."<br /><br />"Why did you tell your uncle rather than me?" Mrs. Touchett dispassionately asked.<br /><br />Again the girl hesitated. "Because he knows Lord Warburton better."<br /><br />"Yes, but I know you better."<br /><br />"I'm not sure of that," said Isabel, smiling.<br /><br />"Neither am I, after all; especially when you give me that rather conceited look. One would think you were awfully pleased with yourself and had carried off a prize! I suppose that when you refuse an offer like Lord Warburton's it's because you expect to do something better."<br /><br />"Ah, my uncle didn't say that!" cried Isabel, smiling still.<br /><br /></span><span id = 964 >It had been arranged that the two young ladies should proceed to London under Ralph's escort, though Mrs. Touchett looked with little favour on the plan. It was just the sort of plan, she said, that Miss Stackpole would be sure to suggest, and she enquired if the correspondent of the Interviewer was to take the party to stay at her favourite boarding-house.<br /><br />"I don't care where she takes us to stay, so long as there's local colour," said Isabel. "That's what we're going to London for."<br /><br />"I suppose that after a girl has refused an English lord she may do anything," her aunt rejoined. "After that one needn't stand on trifles."<br /><br />"Should you have liked me to marry Lord Warburton?" Isabel enquired.<br /><br />"Of course I should."<br /><br />"I thought you disliked the English so much."<br /><br />"So I do; but it's all the greater reason for making use of them."<br /><br />"Is that your idea of marriage?" And Isabel ventured to add that her aunt appeared to her to have made very little use of Mr. Touchett.<br /><br />"Your uncle's not an English nobleman," said Mrs. Touchett, "though even if he had been I should still probably have taken up my residence in Florence."<br /><br />"Do you think Lord Warburton could make me any better than I am?" the girl asked with some animation. "I don't mean I'm too good to improve. I mean that I don't love Lord Warburton enough to marry him."<br /><br />"You did right to refuse him then," said Mrs. Touchett in her smallest, sparest voice. "Only, the next great offer you get, I hope you'll manage to come up to your standard."<br /><br />"We had better wait till the offer comes before we talk about it. I hope very much I may have no more offers for the present. They upset me completely."<br /><br />"You probably won't be troubled with them if you adopt permanently the Bohemian manner of life. However, I've promised Ralph not to criticise."<br /><br />"I'll do whatever Ralph says is right," Isabel returned. "I've unbounded confidence in Ralph."<br /><br />"His mother's much obliged to you!" this lady dryly laughed.<br /><br />"It seems to me indeed she ought to feel it!" Isabel irrepressibly answered.<br /><br />Ralph had assured her that there would be no violation of decency in their paying a visit--the little party of three--to the sights of the metropolis; but Mrs. Touchett took a different view. Like many ladies of her country who had lived a long time in Europe, she had completely lost her native tact on such points, and in her reaction, not in itself deplorable, against the liberty allowed to young persons beyond the seas, had fallen into gratuitous and exaggerated scruples. Ralph accompanied their visitors to town and established them at a quiet inn in a street that ran at right angles to Piccadilly. His first idea had been to take them to his father's house in Winchester Square, a large, dull mansion which at this period of the year was shrouded in silence and brown holland; but he bethought himself that, the cook being at Gardencourt, there was no one in the house to get them their meals, and Pratt's Hotel accordingly became their resting-place. Ralph, on his side, found quarters in Winchester Square, having a "den" there of which he was very fond and being familiar with deeper fears than that of a cold kitchen. He availed himself largely indeed of the resources of Pratt's Hotel, beginning his day with an early visit to his fellow travellers, who had Mr. Pratt in person, in a large bulging white waistcoat, to remove their dish-covers. Ralph turned up, as he said, after breakfast, and the little party made out a scheme of entertainment for the day. As London wears in the month of September a face blank but for its smears of prior service, the young man, who occasionally took an apologetic tone, was obliged to remind his companion, to Miss Stackpole's high derision, that there wasn't a creature in town.<br /><br />"I suppose you mean the aristocracy are absent," Henrietta answered; "but I don't think you could have a better proof that if they were absent altogether they wouldn't be missed. It seems to me the place is about as full as it can be. There's no one here, of course, but three or four millions of people. What is it you call them--the lower-middle class? They're only the population of London, and that's of no consequence."<br /><br />Ralph declared that for him the aristocracy left no void that Miss Stackpole herself didn't fill, and that a more contented man was nowhere at that moment to be found. In this he spoke the truth, for the stale September days, in the huge half-empty town, had a charm wrapped in them as a coloured gem might be wrapped in a dusty cloth. When he went home at night to the empty house in Winchester Square, after a chain of hours with his comparatively ardent friends, he wandered into the big dusky dining-room, where the candle he took from the hall-table, after letting himself in, constituted the only illumination. The square was still, the house was still; when he raised one of the windows of the dining-room to let in the air he heard the slow creak of the boots of a lone constable. His own step, in the empty place, seemed loud and sonorous; some of the carpets had been raised, and whenever he moved he roused a melancholy echo. He sat down in one of the armchairs; the big dark dining table twinkled here and there in the small candle-light; the pictures on the wall, all of them very brown, looked vague and incoherent. There was a ghostly presence as of dinners long since digested, of table-talk that had lost its actuality. This hint of the supernatural perhaps had something to do with the fact that his imagination took a flight and that he remained in his chair a long time beyond the hour at which he should have been in bed; doing nothing, not even reading the evening paper. I say he did nothing, and I maintain the phrase in the face of the fact that he thought at these moments of Isabel. To think of Isabel could only be for him an idle pursuit, leading to nothing and profiting little to any one. His cousin had not yet seemed to him so charming as during these days spent in sounding, tourist-fashion, the deeps and shallows of the metropolitan element. Isabel was full of premises, conclusions, emotions; if she had come in search of local colour she found it everywhere. She asked more questions than he could answer, and launched brave theories, as to historic cause and social effect, that he was equally unable to accept or to refute. The party went more than once to the British Museum and to that brighter palace of art which reclaims for antique variety so large an area of a monotonous suburb; they spent a morning in the Abbey and went on a penny-steamer to the Tower; they looked at pictures both in public and private collections and sat on various occasions beneath the great trees in Kensington Gardens. Henrietta proved an indestructible sight-seer and a more lenient judge than Ralph had ventured to hope. She had indeed many disappointments, and London at large suffered from her vivid remembrance of the strong points of the American civic idea; but she made the best of its dingy dignities and only heaved an occasional sigh and uttered a desultory "Well!" which led no further and lost itself in retrospect. The truth was that, as she said herself, she was not in her element. "I've not a sympathy with inanimate objects," she remarked to Isabel at the National Gallery; and she continued to suffer from the meagreness of the glimpse that had as yet been vouchsafed to her of the inner life. Landscapes by Turner and Assyrian bulls were a poor substitute for the literary dinner-parties at which she had hoped to meet the genius and renown of Great Britain.<br /><br />"Where are your public men, where are your men and women of intellect?" she enquired of Ralph, standing in the middle of Trafalgar Square as if she had supposed this to be a place where she would naturally meet a few. "That's one of them on the top of the column, you say--Lord Nelson. Was he a lord too? Wasn't he high enough, that they had to stick him a hundred feet in the air? That's the past--I don't care about the past; I want to see some of the leading minds of the present. I won't say of the future, because I don't believe much in your future." Poor Ralph had few leading minds among his acquaintance and rarely enjoyed the pleasure of buttonholing a celebrity; a state of things which appeared to Miss Stackpole to indicate a deplorable want of enterprise. "If I were on the other side I should call," she said, "and tell the gentleman, whoever he might be, that I had heard a great deal about him and had come to see for myself. But I gather from what you say that this is not the custom here. You seem to have plenty of meaningless customs, but none of those that would help along. We are in advance, certainly. I suppose I shall have to give up the social side altogether;" and Henrietta, though she went about with her guidebook and pencil and wrote a letter to the Interviewer about the Tower (in which she described the execution of Lady Jane Grey), had a sad sense of falling below her mission.<br /><br />The incident that had preceded Isabel's departure from Gardencourt left a painful trace in our young woman's mind: when she felt again in her face, as from a recurrent wave, the cold breath of her last suitor's surprise, she could only muffle her head till the air cleared. She could not have done less than what she did; this was certainly true. But her necessity, all the same, had been as graceless as some physical act in a strained attitude, and she felt no desire to take credit for her conduct. Mixed with this imperfect pride, nevertheless, was a feeling of freedom which in itself was sweet and which, as she wandered through the great city with her ill-matched companions, occasionally throbbed into odd demonstrations. When she walked in Kensington Gardens she stopped the children (mainly of the poorer sort) whom she saw playing on the grass; she asked them their names and gave them sixpence and, when they were pretty, kissed them. Ralph noticed these quaint charities; he noticed everything she did. One afternoon, that his companions might pass the time, he invited them to tea in Winchester Square, and he had the house set in order as much as possible for their visit. There was another guest to meet them, an amiable bachelor, an old friend of Ralph's who happened to be in town and for whom prompt commerce with Miss Stackpole appeared to have neither difficulty nor dread. Mr. Bantling, a stout, sleek, smiling man of forty, wonderfully dressed, universally informed and incoherently amused, laughed immoderately at everything Henrietta said, gave her several cups of tea, examined in her society the bric-a-brac, of which Ralph had a considerable collection, and afterwards, when the host proposed they should go out into the square and pretend it was a fete-champetre, walked round the limited enclosure several times with her and, at a dozen turns of their talk, bounded responsive--as with a positive passion for argument--to her remarks upon the inner life.<br /><br />"Oh, I see; I dare say you found it very quiet at Gardencourt. Naturally there's not much going on there when there's such a lot of illness about. Touchett's very bad, you know; the doctors have forbidden his being in England at all, and he has only come back to take care of his father. The old man, I believe, has half a dozen things the matter with him. They call it gout, but to my certain knowledge he has organic disease so developed that you may depend upon it he'll go, some day soon, quite quickly. Of course that sort of thing makes a dreadfully dull house; I wonder they have people when they can do so little for them. Then I believe Mr. Touchett's always squabbling with his wife; she lives away from her husband, you know, in that extraordinary American way of yours. If you want a house where there's always something going on, I recommend you to go down and stay with my sister, Lady Pensil, in Bedfordshire. I'll write to her to-morrow and I'm sure she'll be delighted to ask you. I know just what you want-- you want a house where they go in for theatricals and picnics and that sort of thing. My sister's just that sort of woman; she's always getting up something or other and she's always glad to have the sort of people who help her. I'm sure she'll ask you down by return of post: she's tremendously fond of distinguished people and writers. She writes herself, you know; but I haven't read everything she has written. It's usually poetry, and I don't go in much for poetry--unless it's Byron. I suppose you think a great deal of Byron in America," Mr. Bantling continued, expanding in the stimulating air of Miss Stackpole's attention, bringing up his sequences promptly and changing his topic with an easy turn of hand. Yet he none the less gracefully kept in sight of the idea, dazzling to Henrietta, of her going to stay with Lady Pensil in Bedfordshire. "I understand what you want; you want to see some genuine English sport. The Touchetts aren't English at all, you know; they have their own habits, their own language, their own food--some odd religion even, I believe, of their own. The old man thinks it's wicked to hunt, I'm told. You must get down to my sister's in time for the theatricals, and I'm sure she'll be glad to give you a part. I'm sure you act well; I know you're very clever. My sister's forty years old and has seven children, but she's going to play the principal part. Plain as she is she makes up awfully well--I will say for her. Of course you needn't act if you don't want to."<br /><br />In this manner Mr. Bantling delivered himself while they strolled over the grass in Winchester Square, which, although it had been peppered by the London soot, invited the tread to linger. Henrietta thought her blooming, easy-voiced bachelor, with his impressibility to feminine merit and his splendid range of suggestion, a very agreeable man, and she valued the opportunity he offered her. "I don't know but I would go, if your sister should ask me. I think it would be my duty. What do you call her name?"<br /><br />"Pensil. It's an odd name, but it isn't a bad one."<br /><br />"I think one name's as good as another. But what's her rank?".<br /><br />"Oh, she's a baron's wife; a convenient sort of rank. You're fine enough and you're not too fine."<br /><br />"I don't know but what she'd be too fine for me. What do you call the place she lives in--Bedfordshire?"<br /><br />"She lives away in the northern corner of it. It's a tiresome country, but I dare say you won't mind it. I'll try and run down while you're there."<br /><br />All this was very pleasant to Miss Stackpole, and she was sorry to be obliged to separate from Lady Pensil's obliging brother. But it happened that she had met the day before, in Piccadilly, some friends whom she had not seen for a year: the Miss Climbers, two ladies from Wilmington, Delaware, who had been travelling on the Continent and were now preparing to re-embark. Henrietta had had a long interview with them on the Piccadilly pavement, and though the three ladies all talked at once they had not exhausted their store. It had been agreed therefore that Henrietta should come and dine with them in their lodgings in Jermyn Street at six o'clock on the morrow, and she now bethought herself of this engagement. She prepared to start for Jermyn Street, taking leave first of Ralph Touchett and Isabel, who, seated on garden chairs in another part of the enclosure, were occupied--if the term may be used--with an exchange of amenities less pointed than the practical colloquy of Miss Stackpole and Mr. Bantling. When it had been settled between Isabel and her friend that they should be reunited at some reputable hour at Pratt's Hotel, Ralph remarked that the latter must have a cab. She couldn't walk all the way to Jermyn Street.<br /><br />"I suppose you mean it's improper for me to walk alone!" Henrietta exclaimed. "Merciful powers, have I come to this?"<br /><br />"There's not the slightest need of your walking alone," Mr. Bantling gaily interposed. "I should be greatly pleased to go with you."<br /><br />"I simply meant that you'd be late for dinner," Ralph returned. "Those poor ladies may easily believe that we refuse, at the last, to spare you."<br /><br />"You had better have a hansom, Henrietta," said Isabel.<br /><br />"I'll get you a hansom if you'll trust me," Mr. Bantling went on.<br /><br />"We might walk a little till we meet one."<br /><br />"I don't see why I shouldn't trust him, do you?" Henrietta enquired of Isabel.<br /><br />"I don't see what Mr. Bantling could do to you," Isabel obligingly answered; "but, if you like, we'll walk with you till you find your cab."<br /><br />"Never mind; we'll go alone. Come on, Mr. Bantling, and take care you get me a good one."<br /><br />Mr. Bantling promised to do his best, and the two took their departure, leaving the girl and her cousin together in the square, over which a clear September twilight had now begun to gather. It was perfectly still; the wide quadrangle of dusky houses showed lights in none of the windows, where the shutters and blinds were closed; the pavements were a vacant expanse, and, putting aside two small children from a neighbouring slum, who, attracted by symptoms of abnormal animation in the interior, poked their faces between the rusty rails of the enclosure, the most vivid object within sight was the big red pillar-post on the southeast corner.<br /><br />"Henrietta will ask him to get into the cab and go with her to Jermyn Street," Ralph observed. He always spoke of Miss Stackpole as Henrietta.<br /><br />"Very possibly," said his companion.<br /><br />"Or rather, no, she won't," he went on. "But Bantling will ask leave to get in."<br /><br />"Very likely again. I'm glad very they're such good friends."<br /><br />"She has made a conquest. He thinks her a brilliant woman. It may go far," said Ralph.<br /><br />Isabel was briefly silent. "I call Henrietta a very brilliant woman, but I don't think it will go far. They would never really know each other. He has not the least idea what she really is, and she has no just comprehension of Mr. Bantling."<br /><br />"There's no more usual basis of union than a mutual misunderstanding. But it ought not to be so difficult to understand Bob Bantling," Ralph added. "He is a very simple organism."<br /><br />"Yes, but Henrietta's a simpler one still. And, pray, what am I to do?" Isabel asked, looking about her through the fading light, in which the limited landscape-gardening of the square took on a large and effective appearance. "I don't imagine that you'll propose that you and I, for our amusement, shall drive about London in a hansom."<br /><br />"There's no reason we shouldn't stay here--if you don't dislike it. It's very warm; there will he half an hour yet before dark; and if you permit it I'll light a cigarette."<br /><br />"You may do what you please," said Isabel, "if you'll amuse me till seven o'clock. I propose at that hour to go back and partake of a simple and solitary repast--two poached eggs and a muffin-- at Pratt's Hotel."<br /><br />"Mayn't I dine with you?" Ralph asked.<br /><br />"No, you'll dine at your club."<br /><br />They had wandered back to their chairs in the centre of the square again, and Ralph had lighted his cigarette. It would have given him extreme pleasure to be present in person at the modest little feast she had sketched; but in default of this he liked even being forbidden. For the moment, however, he liked immensely being alone with her, in the thickening dusk, in the centre of the multitudinous town; it made her seem to depend upon him and to be in his power. This power he could exert but vaguely; the best exercise of it was to accept her decisions submissively which indeed there was already an emotion in doing. "Why won't you let me dine with you?" he demanded after a pause.<br /><br />"Because I don't care for it."<br /><br />"I suppose you're tired of me."<br /><br />"I shall be an hour hence. You see I have the gift of foreknowledge."<br /><br />"Oh, I shall be delightful meanwhile," said Ralph.<br /><br />But he said nothing more, and as she made no rejoinder they sat some time in a stillness which seemed to contradict his promise of entertainment. It seemed to him she was preoccupied, and he wondered what she was thinking about; there were two or three very possible subjects. At last he spoke again. "Is your objection to my society this evening caused by your expectation of another visitor?"<br /><br />She turned her head with a glance of her clear, fair eyes. "Another visitor? What visitor should I have?"<br /><br />He had none to suggest; which made his question seem to himself silly as well as brutal. "You've a great many friends that I don't know. You've a whole past from which I was perversely excluded."<br /><br />"You were reserved for my future. You must remember that my past is over there across the water. There's none of it here in London."<br /><br />"Very good, then, since your future is seated beside you. Capital thing to have your future so handy." And Ralph lighted another cigarette and reflected that Isabel probably meant she had received news that Mr. Caspar Goodwood had crossed to Paris. After he had lighted his cigarette he puffed it a while, and then he resumed. "I promised just now to be very amusing; but you see I don't come up to the mark, and the fact is there's a good deal of temerity in one's undertaking to amuse a person like you. What do you care for my feeble attempts? You've grand ideas--you've a high standard in such matters. I ought at least to bring in a band of music or a company of mountebanks."<br /><br />"One mountebank's enough, and you do very well. Pray go on, and in another ten minutes I shall begin to laugh."<br /><br />"I assure you I'm very serious," said Ralph. "You do really ask a great deal."<br /><br />"I don't know what you mean. I ask nothing."<br /><br />"You accept nothing," said Ralph. She coloured, and now suddenly it seemed to her that she guessed his meaning. But why should he speak to her of such things? He hesitated a little and then he continued: "There's something I should like very much to say to you. It's a question I wish to ask. It seems to me I've a right to ask it, because I've a kind of interest in the answer."<br /><br />"Ask what you will," Isabel replied gently, "and I'll try to satisfy you."<br /><br />"Well then, I hope you won't mind my saying that Warburton has told me of something that has passed between you."<br /><br />Isabel suppressed a start; she sat looking at her open fan. "Very good; I suppose it was natural he should tell you."<br /><br />"I have his leave to let you know he has done so. He has some hope still," said Ralph.<br /><br />"Still?"<br /><br />"He had it a few days ago."<br /><br />"I don't believe he has any now," said the girl.<br /><br />"I'm very sorry for him then; he's such an honest man."<br /><br />"Pray, did he ask you to talk to me?"<br /><br />"No, not that. But he told me because he couldn't help it. We're old friends, and he was greatly disappointed. He sent me a line asking me to come and see him, and I drove over to Lockleigh the day before he and his sister lunched with us. He was very heavy-hearted; he had just got a letter from you."<br /><br />"Did he show you the letter?" asked Isabel with momentary loftiness.<br /><br />"By no means. But he told me it was a neat refusal. I was very sorry for him," Ralph repeated.<br /><br />For some moments Isabel said nothing; then at last, "Do you know how often he had seen me?" she enquired. "Five or six times."<br /><br />"That's to your glory."<br /><br />"It's not for that I say it."<br /><br />"What then do you say it for. Not to prove that poor Warburton's state of mind's superficial, because I'm pretty sure you don't think that."<br /><br />Isabel certainly was unable to say she thought it; but presently she said something else. "If you've not been requested by Lord Warburton to argue with me, then you're doing it disinterestedly --or for the love of argument."<br /><br />"I've no wish to argue with you at all. I only wish to leave you alone. I'm simply greatly interested in your own sentiments."<br /><br />"I'm greatly obliged to you!" cried Isabel with a slightly nervous laugh.<br /><br />"Of course you mean that I'm meddling in what doesn't concern me. But why shouldn't I speak to you of this matter without annoying you or embarrassing myself? What's the use of being your cousin if I can't have a few privileges? What's the use of adoring you without hope of a reward if I can't have a few compensations? What's the use of being ill and disabled and restricted to mere spectatorship at the game of life if I really can't see the show when I've paid so much for my ticket? Tell me this," Ralph went on while she listened to him with quickened attention. "What had you in mind when you refused Lord Warburton?"<br /><br />"What had I in mind?"<br /><br />"What was the logic--the view of your situation--that dictated so remarkable an act?"<br /><br />"I didn't wish to marry him--if that's logic."<br /><br />"No, that's not logic--and I knew that before. It's really nothing, you know. What was it you said to yourself? You certainly said more than that."<br /><br />Isabel reflected a moment, then answered with a question of her own. "Why do you call it a remarkable act? That's what your mother thinks too."<br /><br />"Warburton's such a thorough good sort; as a man, I consider he has hardly a fault. And then he's what they call here no end of a swell. He has immense possessions, and his wife would be thought a superior being. He unites the intrinsic and the extrinsic advantages."<br /><br />Isabel watched her cousin as to see how far he would go. "I refused him because he was too perfect then. I'm not perfect myself, and he's too good for me. Besides, his perfection would irritate me."<br /><br />"That's ingenious rather than candid," said Ralph. "As a fact you think nothing in the world too perfect for you."<br /><br />"Do you think I'm so good?"<br /><br />"No, but you're exacting, all the same, without the excuse of thinking yourself good. Nineteen women out of twenty, however, even of the most exacting sort, would have managed to do with Warburton. Perhaps you don't know how he has been stalked."<br /><br />"I don't wish to know. But it seems to me," said Isabel, "that one day when we talked of him you mentioned odd things in him." Ralph smokingly considered. "I hope that what I said then had no weight with you; for they were not faults, the things I spoke of: they were simply peculiarities of his position. If I had known he wished to marry you I'd never have alluded to them. I think I said that as regards that position he was rather a sceptic. It would have been in your power to make him a believer."<br /><br />"I think not. I don't understand the matter, and I'm not conscious of any mission of that sort. You're evidently disappointed," Isabel added, looking at her cousin with rueful gentleness. "You'd have liked me to make such a marriage."<br /><br />"Not in the least. I'm absolutely without a wish on the subject. I don't pretend to advise you, and I content myself with watching you--with the deepest interest."<br /><br />She gave rather a conscious sigh. "I wish I could be as interesting to myself as I am to you!"<br /><br />"There you're not candid again; you're extremely interesting to yourself. Do you know, however," said Ralph, "that if you've really given Warburton his final answer I'm rather glad it has been what it was. I don't mean I'm glad for you, and still less of course for him. I'm glad for myself."<br /><br />"Are you thinking of proposing to me?"<br /><br />"By no means. From the point of view I speak of that would be fatal; I should kill the goose that supplies me with the material of my inimitable omelettes. I use that animal as the symbol of my insane illusions. What I mean is that I shall have the thrill of seeing what a young lady does who won't marry Lord Warburton."<br /><br />"That's what your mother counts upon too," said Isabel.<br /><br />"Ah, there will be plenty of spectators! We shall hang on the rest of your career. I shall not see all of it, but I shall probably see the most interesting years. Of course if you were to marry our friend you'd still have a career--a very decent, in fact a very brilliant one. But relatively speaking it would be a little prosaic. It would be definitely marked out in advance; it would be wanting in the unexpected. You know I'm extremely fond of the unexpected, and now that you've kept the game in your hands I depend on your giving us some grand example of it."<br /><br />"I don't understand you very well," said Isabel, "but I do so well enough to be able to say that if you look for grand examples of anything from me I shall disappoint you."<br /><br />"You'll do so only by disappointing yourself and that will go hard with you!"<br /><br />To this she made no direct reply; there was an amount of truth in it that would bear consideration. At last she said abruptly: "I don't see what harm there is in my wishing not to tie myself. I don't want to begin life by marrying. There are other things a woman can do."<br /><br />"There's nothing she can do so well. But you're of course so many-sided."<br /><br />"If one's two-sided it's enough," said Isabel.<br /><br />"You're the most charming of polygons!" her companion broke out. At a glance from his companion, however, he became grave, and to prove it went on: "You want to see life--you'll be hanged if you don't, as the young men say."<br /><br />"I don't think I want to see it as the young men want to see it. But I do want to look about me."<br /><br />"You want to drain the cup of experience."<br /><br />"No, I don't wish to touch the cup of experience. It's a poisoned drink! I only want to see for myself."<br /><br />"You want to see, but not to feel," Ralph remarked.<br /><br />"I don't think that if one's a sentient being one can make the distinction. I'm a good deal like Henrietta. The other day when I asked her if she wished to marry she said: 'Not till I've seen Europe!' I too don't wish to marry till I've seen Europe."<br /><br />"You evidently expect a crowned head will be struck with you."<br /><br />"No, that would be worse than marrying Lord Warburton. But it's getting very dark," Isabel continued, "and I must go home." She rose from her place, but Ralph only sat still and looked at her. As he remained there she stopped, and they exchanged a gaze that was full on either side, but especially on Ralph's, of utterances too vague for words.<br /><br />"You've answered my question," he said at last. "You've told me what I wanted. I'm greatly obliged to you."<br /><br />"It seems to me I've told you very little."<br /><br />"You've told me the great thing: that the world interests you and that you want to throw yourself into it."<br /><br />Her silvery eyes shone a moment in the dusk. "I never said that." "I think you meant it. Don't repudiate it. It's so fine!"<br /><br />"I don't know what you're trying to fasten upon me, for I'm not in the least an adventurous spirit. Women are not like men."<br /><br />Ralph slowly rose from his seat and they walked together to the gate of the square. "No," he said; "women rarely boast of their courage. Men do so with a certain frequency."<br /><br />"Men have it to boast of!"<br /><br />"Women have it too. You've a great deal."<br /><br />"Enough to go home in a cab to Pratt's Hotel, but not more."<br /><br />Ralph unlocked the gate, and after they had passed out he fastened it. "We'll find your cab," he said; and as they turned toward a neighbouring street in which this quest might avail he asked her again if he mightn't see her safely to the inn.<br /><br />"By no means," she answered; "you're very tired; you must go home and go to bed."<br /><br />The cab was found, and he helped her into it, standing a moment at the door. "When people forget I'm a poor creature I'm often incommoded," he said. "But it's worse when they remember it!"<br /><br /></span><span id = 965 >She had had no hidden motive in wishing him not to take her home; it simply struck her that for some days past she had consumed an inordinate quantity of his time, and the independent spirit of the American girl whom extravagance of aid places in an attitude that she ends by finding "affected" had made her decide that for these few hours she must suffice to herself. She had moreover a great fondness for intervals of solitude, which since her arrival in England had been but meagrely met. It was a luxury she could always command at home and she had wittingly missed it. That evening, however, an incident occurred which--had there been a critic to note it--would have taken all colour from the theory that the wish to be quite by herself had caused her to dispense with her cousin's attendance. Seated toward nine o'clock in the dim illumination of Pratt's Hotel and trying with the aid of two tall candles to lose herself in a volume she had brought from Gardencourt, she succeeded only to the extent of reading other words than those printed on the page--words that Ralph had spoken to her that afternoon. Suddenly the well-muffed knuckle of the waiter was applied to the door, which presently gave way to his exhibition, even as a glorious trophy, of the card of a visitor. When this memento had offered to her fixed sight the name of Mr. Caspar Goodwood she let the man stand before her without signifying her wishes.<br /><br />"Shall I show the gentleman up, ma'am?" he asked with a slightly encouraging inflexion.<br /><br />Isabel hesitated still and while she hesitated glanced at the mirror. "He may come in," she said at last; and waited for him not so much smoothing her hair as girding her spirit.<br /><br />Caspar Goodwood was accordingly the next moment shaking hands with her, but saying nothing till the servant had left the room. "Why didn't you answer my letter?" he then asked in a quick, full, slightly peremptory tone--the tone of a man whose questions were habitually pointed and who was capable of much insistence.<br /><br />She answered by a ready question, "How did you know I was here?"<br /><br />"Miss Stackpole let me know," said Caspar Goodwood. "She told me you would probably be at home alone this evening and would be willing to see me."<br /><br />"Where did she see you--to tell you that?"<br /><br />"She didn't see me; she wrote to me."<br /><br />Isabel was silent; neither had sat down; they stood there with an air of defiance, or at least of contention. "Henrietta never told me she was writing to you," she said at last. "This is not kind of her."<br /><br />"Is it so disagreeable to you to see me?" asked the young man.<br /><br />"I didn't expect it. I don't like such surprises."<br /><br />"But you knew I was in town; it was natural we should meet."<br /><br />"Do you call this meeting? I hoped I shouldn't see you. In so big a place as London it seemed very possible."<br /><br />"It was apparently repugnant to you even to write to me," her visitor went on.<br /><br />Isabel made no reply; the sense of Henrietta Stackpole's treachery, as she momentarily qualified it, was strong within her. "Henrietta's certainly not a model of all the delicacies!" she exclaimed with bitterness. "It was a great liberty to take."<br /><br />"I suppose I'm not a model either--of those virtues or of any others. The fault's mine as much as hers."<br /><br />As Isabel looked at him it seemed to her that his jaw had never been more square. This might have displeased her, but she took a different turn. "No, it's not your fault so much as hers. What you've done was inevitable, I suppose, for you."<br /><br />"It was indeed!" cried Caspar Goodwood with a voluntary laugh.<br /><br />"And now that I've come, at any rate, mayn't I stay?"<br /><br />"You may sit down, certainly."<br /><br />She went back to her chair again, while her visitor took the first place that offered, in the manner of a man accustomed to pay little thought to that sort of furtherance. "I've been hoping every day for an answer to my letter. You might have written me a few lines."<br /><br />"It wasn't the trouble of writing that prevented me; I could as easily have written you four pages as one. But my silence was an intention," Isabel said. "I thought it the best thing."<br /><br />He sat with his eyes fixed on hers while she spoke; then he lowered them and attached them to a spot in the carpet as if he were making a strong effort to say nothing but what he ought. He was a strong man in the wrong, and he was acute enough to see that an uncompromising exhibition of his strength would only throw the falsity of his position into relief. Isabel was not incapable of tasting any advantage of position over a person of this quality, and though little desirous to flaunt it in his face she could enjoy being able to say "You know you oughtn't to have written to me yourself!" and to say it with an air of triumph.<br /><br />Caspar Goodwood raised his eyes to her own again; they seemed to shine through the vizard of a helmet. He had a strong sense of justice and was ready any day in the year--over and above this-- to argue the question of his rights. "You said you hoped never to hear from me again; I know that. But I never accepted any such rule as my own. I warned you that you should hear very soon."<br /><br />"I didn't say I hoped NEVER to hear from you," said Isabel.<br /><br />"Not for five years then; for ten years; twenty years. It's the same thing."<br /><br />"Do you find it so? It seems to me there's a great difference. I can imagine that at the end of ten years we might have a very pleasant correspondence. I shall have matured my epistolary style."<br /><br />She looked away while she spoke these words, knowing them of so much less earnest a cast than the countenance of her listener. Her eyes, however, at last came back to him, just as he said very irrelevantly; "Are you enjoying your visit to your uncle?"<br /><br />"Very much indeed." She dropped, but then she broke out. "What good do you expect to get by insisting?"<br /><br />"The good of not losing you."<br /><br />"You've no right to talk of losing what's not yours. And even from your own point of view," Isabel added, "you ought to know when to let one alone."<br /><br />"I disgust you very much," said Caspar Goodwood gloomily; not as if to provoke her to compassion for a man conscious of this blighting fact, but as if to set it well before himself, so that he might endeavour to act with his eyes on it.<br /><br />"Yes, you don't at all delight me, you don't fit in, not in any way, just now, and the worst is that your putting it to the proof in this manner is quite unnecessary." It wasn't certainly as if his nature had been soft, so that pin-pricks would draw blood from it; and from the first of her acquaintance with him, and of her having to defend herself against a certain air that he had of knowing better what was good for her than she knew herself, she had recognised the fact that perfect frankness was her best weapon. To attempt to spare his sensibility or to escape from him edgewise, as one might do from a man who had barred the way less sturdily--this, in dealing with Caspar Goodwood, who would grasp at everything of every sort that one might give him, was wasted agility. It was not that he had not susceptibilities, but his passive surface, as well as his active, was large and hard, and he might always be trusted to dress his wounds, so far as they required it, himself. She came back, even for her measure of possible pangs and aches in him, to her old sense that he was naturally plated and steeled, armed essentially for aggression.<br /><br />"I can't reconcile myself to that," he simply said. There was a dangerous liberality about it; for she felt how open it was to him to make the point that he had not always disgusted her.<br /><br />"I can't reconcile myself to it either, and it's not the state of things that ought to exist between us. If you'd only try to banish me from your mind for a few months we should be on good terms again."<br /><br />"I see. If I should cease to think of you at all for a prescribed time, I should find I could keep it up indefinitely."<br /><br />"Indefinitely is more than I ask. It's more even than I should like."<br /><br />"You know that what you ask is impossible," said the young man, taking his adjective for granted in a manner she found irritating.<br /><br />"Aren't you capable of making a calculated effort?" she demanded. "You're strong for everything else; why shouldn't you be strong for that?"<br /><br />"An effort calculated for what?" And then as she hung fire, "I'm capable of nothing with regard to you," he went on, "but just of being infernally in love with you. If one's strong one loves only the more strongly."<br /><br />"There's a good deal in that;" and indeed our young lady felt the force of it--felt it thrown off, into the vast of truth and poetry, as practically a bait to her imagination. But she promptly came round. "Think of me or not, as you find most possible; only leave me alone."<br /><br />"Until when?"<br /><br />"Well, for a year or two."<br /><br />"Which do you mean? Between one year and two there's all the difference in the world."<br /><br />"Call it two then," said Isabel with a studied effect of eagerness.<br /><br />"And what shall I gain by that?" her friend asked with no sign of wincing.<br /><br />"You'll have obliged me greatly."<br /><br />"And what will be my reward?"<br /><br />"Do you need a reward for an act of generosity?"<br /><br />"Yes, when it involves a great sacrifice."<br /><br />"There's no generosity without some sacrifice. Men don't understand such things. If you make the sacrifice you'll have all my admiration."<br /><br />"I don't care a cent for your admiration--not one straw, with nothing to show for it. When will you marry me? That's the only question."<br /><br />"Never--if you go on making me feel only as I feel at present."<br /><br />"What do I gain then by not trying to make you feel otherwise?"<br /><br />"You'll gain quite as much as by worrying me to death!" Caspar Goodwood bent his eyes again and gazed a while into the crown of his hat. A deep flush overspread his face; she could see her sharpness had at last penetrated. This immediately had a value --classic, romantic, redeeming, what did she know? for her; "the strong man in pain" was one of the categories of the human appeal, little charm as he might exert in the given case. "Why do you make me say such things to you?" she cried in a trembling voice. "I only want to be gentle--to be thoroughly kind. It's not delightful to me to feel people care for me and yet to have to try and reason them out of it. I think others also ought to be considerate; we have each to judge for ourselves. I know you're considerate, as much as you can be; you've good reasons for what you do. But I really don't want to marry, or to talk about it at all now. I shall probably never do it--no, never. I've a perfect right to feel that way, and it's no kindness to a woman to press her so hard, to urge her against her will. If I give you pain I can only say I'm very sorry. It's not my fault; I can't marry you simply to please you. I won't say that I shall always remain your friend, because when women say that, in these situations, it passes, I believe, for a sort of mockery. But try me some day."<br /><br />Caspar Goodwood, during this speech, had kept his eyes fixed upon the name of his hatter, and it was not until some time after she had ceased speaking that he raised them. When he did so the sight of a rosy, lovely eagerness in Isabel's face threw some confusion into his attempt to analyse her words. "I'll go home--I'll go to-morrow--I'll leave you alone," he brought out at last. "Only," he heavily said, "I hate to lose sight of you!"<br /><br />"Never fear. I shall do no harm."<br /><br />"You'll marry some one else, as sure as I sit here," Caspar Goodwood declared.<br /><br />"Do you think that a generous charge?"<br /><br />"Why not? Plenty of men will try to make you."<br /><br />"I told you just now that I don't wish to marry and that I almost certainly never shall."<br /><br />"I know you did, and I like your 'almost certainly'! I put no faith in what you say."<br /><br />"Thank you very much. Do you accuse me of lying to shake you off? You say very delicate things."<br /><br />"Why should I not say that? You've given me no pledge of anything at all."<br /><br />"No, that's all that would be wanting!"<br /><br />"You may perhaps even believe you're safe--from wishing to be. But you're not," the young man went on as if preparing himself for the worst.<br /><br />"Very well then. We'll put it that I'm not safe. Have it as you please."<br /><br />"I don't know, however," said Caspar Goodwood, "that my keeping you in sight would prevent it."<br /><br />"Don't you indeed? I'm after all very much afraid of you. Do you think I'm so very easily pleased?" she asked suddenly, changing her tone.<br /><br />"No--I don't; I shall try to console myself with that. But there are a certain number of very dazzling men in the world, no doubt; and if there were only one it would be enough. The most dazzling of all will make straight for you. You'll be sure to take no one who isn't dazzling."<br /><br />"If you mean by dazzling brilliantly clever," Isabel said--"and I can't imagine what else you mean--I don't need the aid of a clever man to teach me how to live. I can find it out for myself."<br /><br />"Find out how to live alone? I wish that, when you have, you'd teach me!"<br /><br />She looked at him a moment; then with a quick smile, "Oh, you ought to marry!" she said.<br /><br />He might be pardoned if for an instant this exclamation seemed to him to sound the infernal note, and it is not on record that her motive for discharging such a shaft had been of the clearest. He oughtn't to stride about lean and hungry, however--she certainly felt THAT for him. "God forgive you!" he murmured between his teeth as he turned away.<br /><br />Her accent had put her slightly in the wrong, and after a moment she felt the need to right herself. The easiest way to do it was to place him where she had been. "You do me great injustice--you say what you don't know!" she broke out. "I shouldn't be an easy victim--I've proved it."<br /><br />"Oh, to me, perfectly."<br /><br />"I've proved it to others as well." And she paused a moment. "I refused a proposal of marriage last week; what they call--no doubt--a dazzling one."<br /><br />"I'm very glad to hear it," said the young man gravely.<br /><br />"It was a proposal many girls would have accepted; it had everything to recommend it." Isabel had not proposed to herself to tell this story, but, now she had begun, the satisfaction of speaking it out and doing herself justice took possession of her. "I was offered a great position and a great fortune--by a person whom I like extremely."<br /><br />Caspar watched her with intense interest. "Is he an Englishman?"<br /><br />"He's an English nobleman," said Isabel.<br /><br />Her visitor received this announcement at first in silence, but at last said: "I'm glad he's disappointed."<br /><br />"Well then, as you have companions in misfortune, make the best of it."<br /><br />"I don't call him a companion," said Casper grimly.<br /><br />"Why not--since I declined his offer absolutely?"<br /><br />"That doesn't make him my companion. Besides, he's an Englishman."<br /><br />"And pray isn't an Englishman a human being?" Isabel asked.<br /><br />"Oh, those people They're not of my humanity, and I don't care what becomes of them."<br /><br />"You're very angry," said the girl. "We've discussed this matter quite enough."<br /><br />"Oh yes, I'm very angry. I plead guilty to that!"<br /><br />She turned away from him, walked to the open window and stood a moment looking into the dusky void of the street, where a turbid gaslight alone represented social animation. For some time neither of these young persons spoke; Caspar lingered near the chimney-piece with eyes gloomily attached. She had virtually requested him to go--he knew that; but at the risk of making himself odious he kept his ground. She was far too dear to him to be easily renounced, and he had crossed the sea all to wring from her some scrap of a vow. Presently she left the window and stood again before him. "You do me very little justice-- after my telling you what I told you just now. I'm sorry I told you--since it matters so little to you."<br /><br />"Ah," cried the young man, "if you were thinking of ME when you did it!" And then he paused with the fear that she might contradict so happy a thought.<br /><br />"I was thinking of you a little," said Isabel.<br /><br />"A little? I don't understand. If the knowledge of what I feel for you had any weight with you at all, calling it a 'little' is a poor account of it."<br /><br />Isabel shook her head as if to carry off a blunder. "I've refused a most kind, noble gentleman. Make the most of that."<br /><br />"I thank you then," said Caspar Goodwood gravely. "I thank you immensely."<br /><br />"And now you had better go home."<br /><br />"May I not see you again?" he asked.<br /><br />"I think it's better not. You'll be sure to talk of this, and you see it leads to nothing."<br /><br />"I promise you not to say a word that will annoy you."<br /><br />Isabel reflected and then answered: "I return in a day or two to my uncle's, and I can't propose to you to come there. It would be too inconsistent."<br /><br />Caspar Goodwood, on his side, considered. "You must do me justice too. I received an invitation to your uncle's more than a week ago, and I declined it."<br /><br />She betrayed surprise. "From whom was your invitation?"<br /><br />"From Mr. Ralph Touchett, whom I suppose to be your cousin. I declined it because I had not your authorisation to accept it. The suggestion that Mr. Touchett should invite me appeared to have come from Miss Stackpole."<br /><br />"It certainly never did from me. Henrietta really goes very far," Isabel added.<br /><br />"Don't be too hard on her--that touches ME."<br /><br />"No; if you declined you did quite right, and I thank you for it." And she gave a little shudder of dismay at the thought that Lord Warburton and Mr. Goodwood might have met at Gardencourt: it would have been so awkward for Lord Warburton.<br /><br />"When you leave your uncle where do you go?" her companion asked.<br /><br />"I go abroad with my aunt--to Florence and other places."<br /><br />The serenity of this announcement struck a chill to the young man's heart; he seemed to see her whirled away into circles from which he was inexorably excluded. Nevertheless he went on quickly with his questions. "And when shall you come back to America?"<br /><br />"Perhaps not for a long time. I'm very happy here."<br /><br />"Do you mean to give up your country?"<br /><br />"Don't be an infant!"<br /><br />"Well, you'll be out of my sight indeed!" said Caspar Goodwood.<br /><br />"I don't know," she answered rather grandly. "The world--with all these places so arranged and so touching each other--comes to strike one as rather small."<br /><br />"It's a sight too big for ME!" Caspar exclaimed with a simplicity our young lady might have found touching if her face had not been set against concessions.<br /><br />This attitude was part of a system, a theory, that she had lately embraced, and to be thorough she said after a moment: "Don't think me unkind if I say it's just THAT--being out of your sight-- that I like. If you were in the same place I should feel you were watching me, and I don't like that--I like my liberty too much. If there's a thing in the world I'm fond of," she went on with a slight recurrence of grandeur, "it's my personal independence."<br /><br />But whatever there might be of the too superior in this speech moved Caspar Goodwood's admiration; there was nothing he winced at in the large air of it. He had never supposed she hadn't wings and the need of beautiful free movements--he wasn't, with his own long arms and strides, afraid of any force in her. Isabel's words, if they had been meant to shock him, failed of the mark and only made him smile with the sense that here was common ground. "Who would wish less to curtail your liberty than I? What can give me greater pleasure than to see you perfectly independent--doing whatever you like? It's to make you independent that I want to marry you."<br /><br />"That's a beautiful sophism," said the girl with a smile more beautiful still.<br /><br />"An unmarried woman--a girl of your age--isn't independent. There are all sorts of things she can't do. She's hampered at every step."<br /><br />"That's as she looks at the question," Isabel answered with much spirit. "I'm not in my first youth--I can do what I choose--I belong quite to the independent class. I've neither father nor mother; I'm poor and of a serious disposition; I'm not pretty. I therefore am not bound to be timid and conventional; indeed I can't afford such luxuries. Besides, I try to judge things for myself; to judge wrong, I think, is more honourable than not to judge at all. I don't wish to be a mere sheep in the flock; I wish to choose my fate and know something of human affairs beyond what other people think it compatible with propriety to tell me." She paused a moment, but not long enough for her companion to reply. He was apparently on the point of doing so when she went on: "Let me say this to you, Mr. Goodwood. You're so kind as to speak of being afraid of my marrying. If you should hear a rumour that I'm on the point of doing so--girls are liable to have such things said about them--remember what I have told you about my love of liberty and venture to doubt it."<br /><br />There was something passionately positive in the tone in which she gave him this advice, and he saw a shining candour in her eyes that helped him to believe her. On the whole he felt reassured, and you might have perceived it by the manner in which he said, quite eagerly: "You want simply to travel for two years? I'm quite willing to wait two years, and you may do what you like in the interval. If that's all you want, pray say so. I don't want you to be conventional; do I strike you as conventional myself? Do you want to improve your mind? Your mind's quite good enough for me; but if it interests you to wander about a while and see different countries I shall be delighted to help you in any way in my power."<br /><br />"You're very generous; that's nothing new to me. The best way to help me will be to put as many hundred miles of sea between us as possible."<br /><br />"One would think you were going to commit some atrocity!" said Caspar Goodwood.<br /><br />"Perhaps I am. I wish to be free even to do that if the fancy takes me."<br /><br />"Well then," he said slowly, "I'll go home." And he put out his hand, trying to look contented and confident.<br /><br />Isabel's confidence in him, however, was greater than any he could feel in her. Not that he thought her capable of committing an atrocity; but, turn it over as he would, there was something ominous in the way she reserved her option. As she took his hand she felt a great respect for him; she knew how much he cared for her and she thought him magnanimous. They stood so for a moment, looking at each other, united by a hand-clasp which was not merely passive on her side. "That's right," she said very kindly, almost tenderly. "You'll lose nothing by being a reasonable man."<br /><br />"But I'll come back, wherever you are, two years hence," he returned with characteristic grimness.<br /><br />We have seen that our young lady was inconsequent, and at this she suddenly changed her note. "Ah, remember, I promise nothing-- absolutely nothing!" Then more softly, as if to help him to leave her: "And remember too that I shall not be an easy victim!"<br /><br />"You'll get very sick of your independence."<br /><br />"Perhaps I shall; it's even very probable. When that day comes I shall be very glad to see you."<br /><br />She had laid her hand on the knob of the door that led into her room, and she waited a moment to see whether her visitor would not take his departure. But he appeared unable to move; there was still an immense unwillingness in his attitude and a sore remonstrance in his eyes. "I must leave you now," said Isabel; and she opened the door and passed into the other room.<br /><br />This apartment was dark, but the darkness was tempered by a vague radiance sent up through the window from the court of the hotel, and Isabel could make out the masses of the furniture, the dim shining of the mirror and the looming of the big four-posted bed. She stood still a moment, listening, and at last she heard Caspar Goodwood walk out of the sitting-room and close the door behind him. She stood still a little longer, and then, by an irresistible impulse, dropped on her knees before her bed and hid her face in her arms.<br /><br /></span><span id = 966 >She was not praying; she was trembling--trembling all over. Vibration was easy to her, was in fact too constant with her, and she found herself now humming like a smitten harp. She only asked, however, to put on the cover, to case herself again in brown holland, but she wished to resist her excitement, and the attitude of devotion, which she kept for some time, seemed to help her to be still. She intensely rejoiced that Caspar Goodwood was gone; there was something in having thus got rid of him that was like the payment, for a stamped receipt, of some debt too long on her mind. As she felt the glad relief she bowed her head a little lower; the sense was there, throbbing in her heart; it was part of her emotion, but it was a thing to be ashamed of--it was profane and out of place. It was not for some ten minutes that she rose from her knees, and even when she came back to the sitting-room her tremor had not quite subsided. It had had, verily, two causes: part of it was to be accounted for by her long discussion with Mr. Goodwood, but it might be feared that the rest was simply the enjoyment she found in the exercise of her power. She sat down in the same chair again and took up her book, but without going through the form of opening the volume. She leaned back, with that low, soft, aspiring murmur with which she often uttered her response to accidents of which the brighter side was not superficially obvious, and yielded to the satisfaction of having refused two ardent suitors in a fortnight. That love of liberty of which she had given Caspar Goodwood so bold a sketch was as yet almost exclusively theoretic; she had not been able to indulge it on a large scale. But it appeared to her she had done something; she had tasted of the delight, if not of battle, at least of victory; she had done what was truest to her plan. In the glow of this consciousness the image of Mr. Goodwood taking his sad walk homeward through the dingy town presented itself with a certain reproachful force; so that, as at the same moment the door of the room was opened, she rose with an apprehension that he had come back. But it was only Henrietta Stackpole returning from her dinner.<br /><br />Miss Stackpole immediately saw that our young lady had been "through" something, and indeed the discovery demanded no great penetration. She went straight up to her friend, who received her without a greeting. Isabel's elation in having sent Caspar Goodwood back to America presupposed her being in a manner glad he had come to see her; but at the same time she perfectly remembered Henrietta had had no right to set a trap for her. "Has he been here, dear?" the latter yearningly asked.<br /><br />Isabel turned away and for some moments answered nothing. "You acted very wrongly," she declared at last.<br /><br />"I acted for the best. I only hope you acted as well."<br /><br />"You're not the judge. I can't trust you," said Isabel.<br /><br />This declaration was unflattering, but Henrietta was much too unselfish to heed the charge it conveyed; she cared only for what it intimated with regard to her friend. "Isabel Archer," she observed with equal abruptness and solemnity, "if you marry one of these people I'll never speak to you again!"<br /><br />"Before making so terrible a threat you had better wait till I'm asked," Isabel replied. Never having said a word to Miss Stackpole about Lord Warburton's overtures, she had now no impulse whatever to justify herself to Henrietta by telling her that she had refused that nobleman.<br /><br />"Oh, you'll be asked quick enough, once you get off on the Continent. Annie Climber was asked three times in Italy--poor plain little Annie."<br /><br />"Well, if Annie Climber wasn't captured why should I be?"<br /><br />"I don't believe Annie was pressed; but you'll be."<br /><br />"That's a flattering conviction," said Isabel without alarm.<br /><br />"I don't flatter you, Isabel, I tell you the truth!" cried her friend. "I hope you don't mean to tell me that you didn't give Mr. Goodwood some hope."<br /><br />"I don't see why I should tell you anything; as I said to you just now, I can't trust you. But since you're so much interested in Mr. Goodwood I won't conceal from you that he returns immediately to America."<br /><br />"You don't mean to say you've sent him off?" Henrietta almost shrieked.<br /><br />"I asked him to leave me alone; and I ask you the same, Henrietta." Miss Stackpole glittered for an instant with dismay, and then passed to the mirror over the chimney-piece and took off her bonnet. "I hope you've enjoyed your dinner," Isabel went on.<br /><br />But her companion was not to be diverted by frivolous propositions. "Do you know where you're going, Isabel Archer?"<br /><br />"Just now I'm going to bed," said Isabel with persistent frivolity.<br /><br />"Do you know where you're drifting?" Henrietta pursued, holding out her bonnet delicately.<br /><br />"No, I haven't the least idea, and I find it very pleasant not to know. A swift carriage, of a dark night, rattling with four horses over roads that one can't see--that's my idea of happiness."<br /><br />"Mr. Goodwood certainly didn't teach you to say such things as that--like the heroine of an immoral novel," said Miss Stackpole. "You're drifting to some great mistake."<br /><br />Isabel was irritated by her friend's interference, yet she still tried to think what truth this declaration could represent. She could think of nothing that diverted her from saying: "You must be very fond of me, Henrietta, to be willing to be so aggressive."<br /><br />"I love you intensely, Isabel," said Miss Stackpole with feeling,<br /><br />"Well, if you love me intensely let me as intensely alone. I asked that of Mr. Goodwood, and I must also ask it of you."<br /><br />"Take care you're not let alone too much."<br /><br />"That's what Mr. Goodwood said to me. I told him I must take the risks."<br /><br />"You're a creature of risks--you make me shudder!" cried Henrietta. "When does Mr. Goodwood return to America?"<br /><br />"I don't know--he didn't tell me."<br /><br />"Perhaps you didn't enquire," said Henrietta with the note of righteous irony.<br /><br />"I gave him too little satisfaction to have the right to ask questions of him."<br /><br />This assertion seemed to Miss Stackpole for a moment to bid defiance to comment; but at last she exclaimed: "Well, Isabel, if I didn't know you I might think you were heartless!"<br /><br />"Take care," said Isabel; "you're spoiling me."<br /><br />"I'm afraid I've done that already. I hope, at least," Miss Stackpole added, "that he may cross with Annie Climber!"<br /><br />Isabel learned from her the next morning that she had determined not to return to Gardencourt (where old Mr. Touchett had promised her a renewed welcome), but to await in London the arrival of the invitation that Mr. Bantling had promised her from his sister Lady Pensil. Miss Stackpole related very freely her conversation with Ralph Touchett's sociable friend and declared to Isabel that she really believed she had now got hold of something that would lead to something. On the receipt of Lady Pensil's letter--Mr. Bantling had virtually guaranteed the arrival of this document--she would immediately depart for Bedfordshire, and if Isabel cared to look out for her impressions in the Interviewer she would certainly find them. Henrietta was evidently going to see something of the inner life this time.<br /><br />"Do you know where you're drifting, Henrietta Stackpole?" Isabel asked, imitating the tone in which her friend had spoken the night before.<br /><br />"I'm drifting to a big position--that of the Queen of American Journalism. If my next letter isn't copied all over the West I'll swallow my penwiper!"<br /><br />She had arranged with her friend Miss Annie Climber, the young lady of the continental offers, that they should go together to make those purchases which were to constitute Miss Climber's farewell to a hemisphere in which she at least had been appreciated; and she presently repaired to Jermyn Street to pick up her companion. Shortly after her departure Ralph Touchett was announced, and as soon as he came in Isabel saw he had something on his mind. He very soon took his cousin into his confidence. He had received from his mother a telegram to the effect that his father had had a sharp attack of his old malady, that she was much alarmed and that she begged he would instantly return to Gardencourt. On this occasion at least Mrs. Touchett's devotion to the electric wire was not open to criticism.<br /><br />"I've judged it best to see the great doctor, Sir Matthew Hope, first," Ralph said; "by great good luck he's in town. He's to see me at half-past twelve, and I shall make sure of his coming down to Gardencourt--which he will do the more readily as he has already seen my father several times, both there and in London. There's an express at two-forty-five, which I shall take; and you'll come back with me or remain here a few days longer, exactly as you prefer."<br /><br />"I shall certainly go with you," Isabel returned. "I don't suppose I can be of any use to my uncle, but if he's ill I shall like to be near him."<br /><br />"I think you're fond of him," said Ralph with a certain shy pleasure in his face. "You appreciate him, which all the world hasn't done. The quality's too fine."<br /><br />"I quite adore him," Isabel after a moment said.<br /><br />"That's very well. After his son he's your greatest admirer." She welcomed this assurance, but she gave secretly a small sigh of relief at the thought that Mr. Touchett was one of those admirers who couldn't propose to marry her. This, however, was not what she spoke; she went on to inform Ralph that there were other reasons for her not remaining in London. She was tired of it and wished to leave it; and then Henrietta was going away-- going to stay in Bedfordshire.<br /><br />"In Bedfordshire?"<br /><br />"With Lady Pensil, the sister of Mr. Bantling, who has answered for an invitation."<br /><br />Ralph was feeling anxious, but at this he broke into a laugh. Suddenly, none the less, his gravity returned. "Bantling's a man of courage. But if the invitation should get lost on the way?"<br /><br />"I thought the British post-office was impeccable."<br /><br />"The good Homer sometimes nods," said Ralph. "However," he went on more brightly, "the good Bantling never does, and, whatever happens, he'll take care of Henrietta."<br /><br />Ralph went to keep his appointment with Sir Matthew Hope, and Isabel made her arrangements for quitting Pratt's Hotel. Her uncle's danger touched her nearly, and while she stood before her open trunk, looking about her vaguely for what she should put into it, the tears suddenly rose to her eyes. It was perhaps for this reason that when Ralph came back at two o'clock to take her to the station she was not yet ready. He found Miss Stackpole, however, in the sitting-room, where she had just risen from her luncheon, and this lady immediately expressed her regret at his father's illness.<br /><br />"He's a grand old man," she said; "he's faithful to the last. If it's really to be the last--pardon my alluding to it, but you must often have thought of the possibility--I'm sorry that I shall not be at Gardencourt."<br /><br />"You'll amuse yourself much more in Bedfordshire."<br /><br />"I shall be sorry to amuse myself at such a time," said Henrietta with much propriety. But she immediately added: "I should like so to commemorate the closing scene."<br /><br />"My father may live a long time," said Ralph simply. Then, adverting to topics more cheerful, he interrogated Miss Stackpole as to her own future.<br /><br />Now that Ralph was in trouble she addressed him in a tone of larger allowance and told him that she was much indebted to him for having made her acquainted with Mr. Bantling. "He has told me just the things I want to know," she said; "all the society items and all about the royal family. I can't make out that what he tells me about the royal family is much to their credit; but he says that's only my peculiar way of looking at it. Well, all I want is that he should give me the facts; I can put them together quick enough, once I've got them." And she added that Mr. Bantling had been so good as to promise to come and take her out that afternoon.<br /><br />"To take you where?" Ralph ventured to enquire.<br /><br />"To Buckingham Palace. He's going to show me over it, so that I may get some idea how they live."<br /><br />"Ah," said Ralph, "we leave you in good hands. The first thing we shall hear is that you're invited to Windsor Castle."<br /><br />"If they ask me, I shall certainly go. Once I get started I'm not afraid. But for all that," Henrietta added in a moment, "I'm not satisfied; I'm not at peace about Isabel."<br /><br />"What is her last misdemeanour?"<br /><br />"Well, I've told you before, and I suppose there's no harm in my going on. I always finish a subject that I take up. Mr. Goodwood was here last night."<br /><br />Ralph opened his eyes; he even blushed a little--his blush being the sign of an emotion somewhat acute. He remembered that Isabel, in separating from him in Winchester Square, had repudiated his suggestion that her motive in doing so was the expectation of a visitor at Pratt's Hotel, and it was a new pang to him to have to suspect her of duplicity. On the other hand, he quickly said to himself, what concern was it of his that she should have made an<br /><br />appointment with a lover? Had it not been thought graceful in<br /><br />every age that young ladies should make a mystery of such appointments? Ralph gave Miss Stackpole a diplomatic answer. "I should have thought that, with the views you expressed to me the other day, this would satisfy you perfectly."<br /><br />"That he should come to see her? That was very well, as far as it went. It was a little plot of mine; I let him know that we were in London, and when it had been arranged that I should spend the evening out I sent him a word--the word we just utter to the 'wise.' I hoped he would find her alone; I won't pretend I didn't hope that you'd be out of the way. He came to see her, but he might as well have stayed away."<br /><br />"Isabel was cruel?"--and Ralph's face lighted with the relief of his cousin's not having shown duplicity.<br /><br />"I don't exactly know what passed between them. But she gave him no satisfaction--she sent him back to America."<br /><br />"Poor Mr. Goodwood!" Ralph sighed.<br /><br />"Her only idea seems to be to get rid of him," Henrietta went on.<br /><br />"Poor Mr. Goodwood!" Ralph repeated. The exclamation, it must be confessed, was automatic; it failed exactly to express his thoughts, which were taking another line.<br /><br />"You don't say that as if you felt it. I don't believe you care."<br /><br />"Ah," said Ralph, "you must remember that I don't know this interesting young man--that I've never seen him."<br /><br />"Well, I shall see him, and I shall tell him not to give up. If I didn't believe Isabel would come round," Miss Stackpole added-- "well, I'd give up myself. I mean I'd give HER up!"<br /><br /></span><span id = 967 >It had occurred to Ralph that, in the conditions, Isabel's partingwith her friend might be of a slightly embarrassed nature, and he wentdown to the door of the hotel in advance of his cousin, who, after aslight delay, followed with the traces of an unaccepted remonstrance,as he thought, in her eyes. The two made the journey to Gardencourt inalmost unbroken silence, and the servant who met them at the stationhad no better news to give them of Mr. Touchett--a fact which causedRalph to congratulate himself afresh on Sir Matthew Hope's havingpromised to come down in the five o'clock train and spend the night.Mrs. Touchett, he learned, on reaching home, had been constantly withthe old man and was with him at that moment; and this fact made Ralphsay to himself that, after all, what his mother wanted was just easyoccasion. The finer natures were those that shone at the larger times.Isabel went to her own room, noting throughout the house thatperceptible hush which precedes a crisis. At the end of an hour,however, she came downstairs in search of her aunt, whom she wished toask about Mr. Touchett. She went into the library, but Mrs. Touchettwas not there, and as the weather, which had been damp and chill, wasnow altogether spoiled, it was not probable she had gone for her usualwalk in the grounds. Isabel was on the point of ringing to send aquestion to her room, when this purpose quickly yielded to anunexpected sound-- the sound of low music proceeding apparently fromthe saloon. She knew her aunt never touched the piano, and the musicianwas therefore probably Ralph, who played for his own amusement. That heshould have resorted to this recreation at the present time indicatedapparently that his anxiety about his father had been relieved; so thatthe girl took her way, almost with restored cheer, toward the source ofthe harmony. The drawing-room at Gardencourt was an apartment of greatdistances, and, as the piano was placed at the end of it furthestremoved from the door at which she entered, her arrival was not noticedby the person seated before the instrument. This person was neitherRalph nor his mother; it was a lady whom Isabel immediately saw to be astranger to herself, though her back was presented to the door. Thisback--an ample and well-dressed one--Isabel viewed for some momentswith surprise. The lady was of course a visitor who had arrived duringher absence and who had not been mentioned by either of theservants--one of them her aunt's maid--of whom she had had speech sinceher return. Isabel had already learned, however, with what treasures ofreserve the function of receiving orders may be accompanied, and shewas particularly conscious of having been treated with dryness by heraunt's maid, through whose hands she had slipped perhaps a little toomistrustfully and with an effect of plumage but the more lustrous. Theadvent of a guest was in itself far from disconcerting; she had not yetdivested herself of a young faith that each new acquaintance wouldexert some momentous influence on her life. By the time she had madethese reflexions she became aware that the lady at the piano playedremarkably well. She was playing something of Schubert's--Isabel knewnot what, but recognised Schubert--and she touched the piano with adiscretion of her own. It showed skill, it showed feeling; Isabel satdown noiselessly on the nearest chair and waited till the end of thepiece. When it was finished she felt a strong desire to thank theplayer, and rose from her seat to do so, while at the same time thestranger turned quickly round, as if but just aware of her presence.<p>"That's very beautiful, and your playing makes it more beautifulstill," said Isabel with all the young radiance with which she usuallyuttered a truthful rapture.</p><p>"You don't think I disturbed Mr. Touchett then?" the musiciananswered as sweetly as this compliment deserved. "The house is so largeand his room so far away that I thought I might venture, especially asI played just--just du bout des doigts."</p><p>"She's a Frenchwoman," Isabel said to herself; "she says that as ifshe were French." And this supposition made the visitor moreinteresting to our speculative heroine. "I hope my uncle's doing well,"Isabel added. "I should think that to hear such lovely music as thatwould really make him feel better."</p><p>The lady smiled and discriminated. "I'm afraid there are moments inlife when even Schubert has nothing to say to us. We must admit,however, that they are our worst."</p><p>"I'm not in that state now then," said Isabel. "On the contrary I should be so glad if you would play something more."</p><p>"If it will give you pleasure--delighted." And this obliging persontook her place again and struck a few chords, while Isabel sat downnearer the instrument. Suddenly the new-comer stopped with her hands onthe keys, half-turning and looking over her shoulder. She was fortyyears old and not pretty, though her expression charmed. "Pardon me,"she said; "but are you the niece --the young American?"</p><p>"I'm my aunt's niece," Isabel replied with simplicity.</p><p>The lady at the piano sat still a moment longer, casting her air ofinterest over her shoulder. "That's very well; we're compatriots." Andthen she began to play.</p><p>"Ah then she's not French," Isabel murmured; and as the oppositesupposition had made her romantic it might have seemed that thisrevelation would have marked a drop. But such was not the fact; rarereven than to be French seemed it to be American on such interestingterms.</p><p>The lady played in the same manner as before, softly and solemnly,and while she played the shadows deepened in the room. The autumntwilight gathered in, and from her place Isabel could see the rain,which had now begun in earnest, washing the cold-looking lawn and thewind shaking the great trees. At last, when the music had ceased, hercompanion got up and, coming nearer with a smile, before Isabel hadtime to thank her again, said: "I'm very glad you've come back; I'veheard a great deal about you."</p><p>Isabel thought her a very attractive person, but nevertheless spokewith a certain abruptness in reply to this speech. "From whom have youheard about me?"</p><p>The stranger hesitated a single moment and then, "From your uncle,"she answered. "I've been here three days, and the first day he let mecome and pay him a visit in his room. Then he talked constantly of you."</p><p>"As you didn't know me that must rather have bored you."</p><p>"It made me want to know you. All the more that since then--youraunt being so much with Mr. Touchett--I've been quite alone and havegot rather tired of my own society. I've not chosen a good moment formy visit."</p><p>A servant had come in with lamps and was presently followed byanother bearing the tea-tray. On the appearance of this repast Mrs.Touchett had apparently been notified, for she now arrived andaddressed herself to the tea-pot. Her greeting to her niece did notdiffer materially from her manner of raising the lid of this receptaclein order to glance at the contents: in neither act was it becoming tomake a show of avidity. Questioned about her husband she was unable tosay he was better; but the local doctor was with him, and much lightwas expected from this gentleman's consultation with Sir Matthew Hope.</p><p>"I suppose you two ladies have made acquaintance," she pursued. "Ifyou haven't I recommend you to do so; for so long as we continue--Ralphand I--to cluster about Mr. Touchett's bed you're not likely to havemuch society but each other."</p><p>"I know nothing about you but that you're a great musician," Isabel</p><pre>said to the visitor.<br /></pre><p>"There's a good deal more than that to know," Mrs. Touchett affirmed in her little dry tone.</p><p>"A very little of it, I am sure, will content Miss Archer!" the ladyexclaimed with a light laugh. "I'm an old friend of your aunt's. I'velived much in Florence. I'm Madame Merle." She made this lastannouncement as if she were referring to a person of tolerably distinctidentity. For Isabel, however, it represented little; she could onlycontinue to feel that Madame Merle had as charming a manner as any shehad ever encountered.</p><p>"She's not a foreigner in spite of her name," said Mrs. Touchett.</p><p>"She was born--I always forget where you were born."</p><p>"It's hardly worth while then I should tell you."</p><p>"On the contrary," said Mrs. Touchett, who rarely missed a logicalpoint; "if I remembered your telling me would be quite superfluous."</p><p>Madame Merle glanced at Isabel with a sort of world-wide smile, athing that over-reached frontiers. "I was born under the shadow of thenational banner."</p><p>"She's too fond of mystery," said Mrs. Touchett; "that's her great fault."</p><p>"Ah," exclaimed Madame Merle, "I've great faults, but I don't thinkthat's one of then; it certainly isn't the greatest. I came into theworld in the Brooklyn navy-yard. My father was a high officer in theUnited States Navy, and had a post--a post of responsibility--in thatestablishment at the time. I suppose I ought to love the sea, but Ihate it. That's why I don't return to America. I love the land; thegreat thing is to love something."</p><p>Isabel, as a dispassionate witness, had not been struck with theforce of Mrs. Touchett's characterisation of her visitor, who had anexpressive, communicative, responsive face, by no means of the sortwhich, to Isabel's mind, suggested a secretive disposition. It was aface that told of an amplitude of nature and of quick and free motionsand, though it had no regular beauty, was in the highest degreeengaging and attaching. Madame Merle was a tall, fair, smooth woman;everything in her person was round and replete, though without thoseaccumulations which suggest heaviness. Her features were thick but inperfect proportion and harmony, and her complexion had a healthyclearness. Her grey eyes were small but full of light and incapable ofstupidity-- incapable, according to some people, even of tears; she hada liberal, full-rimmed mouth which when she smiled drew itself upwardto the left side in a manner that most people thought very odd, somevery affected and a few very graceful. Isabel inclined to range herselfin the last category. Madame Merle had thick, fair hair, arrangedsomehow "classically" and as if she were a Bust, Isabel judged--a Junoor a Niobe; and large white hands, of a perfect shape, a shape soperfect that their possessor, preferring to leave them unadorned, woreno jewelled rings. Isabel had taken her at first, as we have seen, fora Frenchwoman; but extended observation might have ranked her as aGerman--a German of high degree, perhaps an Austrian, a baroness, acountess, a princess. It would never have been supposed she had comeinto the world in Brooklyn--though one could doubtless not have carriedthrough any argument that the air of distinction marking her in soeminent a degree was inconsistent with such a birth. It was true thatthe national banner had floated immediately over her cradle, and thebreezy freedom of the stars and stripes might have shed an influenceupon the attitude she there took towards life. And yet she hadevidently nothing of the fluttered, flapping quality of a morsel ofbunting in the wind; her manner expressed the repose and confidencewhich come from a large experience. Experience, however, had notquenched her youth; it had simply made her sympathetic and supple. Shewas in a word a woman of strong impulses kept in admirable order. Thiscommended itself to Isabel as an ideal combination.</p><p>The girl made these reflexions while the three ladies sat at theirtea, but that ceremony was interrupted before long by the arrival ofthe great doctor from London, who had been immediately ushered into thedrawing-room. Mrs. Touchett took him off to the library for a privatetalk; and then Madame Merle and Isabel parted, to meet again at dinner.The idea of seeing more of this interesting woman did much to mitigateIsabel's sense of the sadness now settling on Gardencourt.</p><p>When she came into the drawing-room before dinner she found theplace empty; but in the course of a moment Ralph arrived. His anxietyabout his father had been lightened; Sir Matthew Hope's view of hiscondition was less depressed than his own had been. The doctorrecommended that the nurse alone should remain with the old man for thenext three or four hours; so that Ralph, his mother and the greatphysician himself were free to dine at table. Mrs. Touchett and SirMatthew appeared; Madame Merle was the last.</p><p>Before she came Isabel spoke of her to Ralph, who was standing before the fireplace. "Pray who is this Madame Merle?"</p><p>"The cleverest woman I know, not excepting yourself," said Ralph.</p><p>"I thought she seemed very pleasant."</p><p>"I was sure you'd think her very pleasant."</p><p>"Is that why you invited her?"</p><p>"I didn't invite her, and when we came back from London I didn'tknow she was here. No one invited her. She's a friend of my mother's,and just after you and I went to town my mother got a note from her.She had arrived in England (she usually lives abroad, though she hasfirst and last spent a good deal of time here), and asked leave to comedown for a few days. She's a woman who can make such proposals withperfect confidence; she's so welcome wherever she goes. And with mymother there could be no question of hesitating; she's the one personin the world whom my mother very much admires. If she were not herself(which she after all much prefers), she would like to be Madame Merle.It would indeed be a great change."</p><p>"Well, she's very charming," said Isabel. "And she plays beautifully."</p><p>"She does everything beautifully. She's complete."</p><p>Isabel looked at her cousin a moment. "You don't like her."</p><p>"On the contrary, I was once in love with her."</p><p>"And she didn't care for you, and that's why you don't like her."</p><p>"How can we have discussed such things? Monsieur Merle was then living."</p><p>"Is he dead now?"</p><p>"So she says."</p><p>"Don't you believe her?"</p><p>"Yes, because the statement agrees with the probabilities. The husband of Madame Merle would be likely to pass away."</p><p>Isabel gazed at her cousin again. "I don't know what you mean. Youmean something--that you don't mean. What was Monsieur Merle?"</p><p>"The husband of Madame."</p><p>"You're very odious. Has she any children?"</p><p>"Not the least little child--fortunately."</p><p>"Fortunately?"</p><p>"I mean fortunately for the child. She'd be sure to spoil it."</p><p>Isabel was apparently on the point of assuring her cousin for thethird time that he was odious; but the discussion was interrupted bythe arrival of the lady who was the topic of it. She came rustling inquickly, apologising for being late, fastening a bracelet, dressed indark blue satin, which exposed a white bosom that was ineffectuallycovered by a curious silver necklace. Ralph offered her his arm withthe exaggerated alertness of a man who was no longer a lover.</p><p>Even if this had still been his condition, however, Ralph had otherthings to think about. The great doctor spent the night at Gardencourtand, returning to London on the morrow, after another consultation withMr. Touchett's own medical adviser, concurred in Ralph's desire that heshould see the patient again on the day following. On the day followingSir Matthew Hope reappeared at Gardencourt, and now took a lessencouraging view of the old man, who had grown worse in the twenty-fourhours. His feebleness was extreme, and to his son, who constantly satby his bedside, it often seemed that his end must be at hand. The localdoctor, a very sagacious man, in whom Ralph had secretly moreconfidence than in his distinguished colleague, was constantly inattendance, and Sir Matthew Hope came back several times. Mr. Touchettwas much of the time unconscious; he slept a great deal; he rarelyspoke. Isabel had a great desire to be useful to him and was allowed towatch with him at hours when his other attendants (of whom Mrs.Touchett was not the least regular) went to take rest. He never seemedto know her, and she always said to herself "Suppose he should diewhile I'm sitting here;" an idea which excited her and kept her awake.Once he opened his eyes for a while and fixed them upon herintelligently, but when she went to him, hoping he would recognise her,he closed them and relapsed into stupor. The day after this, however,he revived for a longer time; but on this occasion Ralph only was withhim. The old man began to talk, much to his son's satisfaction, whoassured him that they should presently have him sitting up.</p><p>"No, my boy," said Mr. Touchett, "not unless you bury me in asitting posture, as some of the ancients--was it the ancients?-- usedto do."</p><p>"Ah, daddy, don't talk about that," Ralph murmured. "You mustn't deny that you're getting better."</p><p>"There will be no need of my denying it if you don't say it," theold man answered. "Why should we prevaricate just at the last? We neverprevaricated before. I've got to die some time, and it's better to diewhen one's sick than when one's well. I'm very sick --as sick as Ishall ever be. I hope you don't want to prove that I shall ever beworse than this? That would be too bad. You don't? Well then."</p><p>Having made this excellent point he became quiet; but the next timethat Ralph was with him he again addressed himself to conversation. Thenurse had gone to her supper and Ralph was alone in charge, having justrelieved Mrs. Touchett, who had been on guard since dinner. The roomwas lighted only by the flickering fire, which of late had becomenecessary, and Ralph's tall shadow was projected over wall and ceilingwith an outline constantly varying but always grotesque.</p><p>"Who's that with me--is it my son?" the old man asked.</p><p>"Yes, it's your son, daddy."</p><p>"And is there no one else?"</p><p>"No one else."</p><p>Mr. Touchett said nothing for a while; and then, "I want to talk a little," he went on.</p><p>"Won't it tire you?" Ralph demurred.</p><p>"It won't matter if it does. I shall have a long rest. I want to talk about YOU."</p><p>Ralph had drawn nearer to the bed; he sat leaning forward with hishand on his father's. "You had better select a brighter topic."</p><p>"You were always bright; I used to be proud of your brightness. I should like so much to think you'd do something."</p><p>"If you leave us," said Ralph, "I shall do nothing but miss you."</p><p>"That's just what I don't want; it's what I want to talk about. You must get a new interest."</p><p>"I don't want a new interest, daddy. I have more old ones than I know what to do with."</p><p>The old man lay there looking at his son; his face was the face ofthe dying, but his eyes were the eyes of Daniel Touchett. He seemed tobe reckoning over Ralph's interests. "Of course you have your mother,"he said at last. "You'll take care of her."</p><p>"My mother will always take care of herself," Ralph returned.</p><p>"Well," said his father, "perhaps as she grows older she'll need a little help."</p><p>"I shall not see that. She'll outlive me."</p><p>"Very likely she will; but that's no reason--!" Mr. Touchett let hisphrase die away in a helpless but not quite querulous sigh and remainedsilent again.</p><p>"Don't trouble yourself about us," said his son, "My mother and I get on very well together, you know."</p><p>"You get on by always being apart; that's not natural."</p><p>"If you leave us we shall probably see more of each other."</p><p>"Well," the old man observed with wandering irrelevance, "it can'tbe said that my death will make much difference in your mother's life."</p><p>"It will probably make more than you think."</p><p>"Well, she'll have more money," said Mr. Touchett. "I've left her a good wife's portion, just as if she had been a good wife."</p><p>"She has been one, daddy, according to her own theory. She has never troubled you."</p><p>"Ah, some troubles are pleasant," Mr. Touchett murmured. "Thoseyou've given me for instance. But your mother has been less--less--what shall I call it? less out of the way since I've been ill. Ipresume she knows I've noticed it."</p><p>"I shall certainly tell her so; I'm so glad you mention it."</p><p>"It won't make any difference to her; she doesn't do it to pleaseme. She does it to please--to please--" And he lay a while trying tothink why she did it. "She does it because it suits her. But that's notwhat I want to talk about," he added. "It's about you. You'll be verywell off."</p><p>"Yes," said Ralph, "I know that. But I hope you've not forgotten thetalk we had a year ago--when I told you exactly what money I shouldneed and begged you to make some good use of the rest."</p><p>"Yes, yes, I remember. I made a new will--in a few days. I supposeit was the first time such a thing had happened--a young man trying toget a will made against him."</p><p>"It is not against me," said Ralph. "It would be against me to havea large property to take care of. It's impossible for a man in my stateof health to spend much money, and enough is as good as a feast."</p><p>"Well, you'll have enough--and something over. There will be more than enough for one--there will be enough for two."</p><p>"That's too much," said Ralph.</p><p>"Ah, don't say that. The best thing you can do; when I'm gone, will be to marry."</p><p>Ralph had foreseen what his father was coming to, and thissuggestion was by no means fresh. It had long been Mr. Touchett's mostingenious way of taking the cheerful view of his son's possibleduration. Ralph had usually treated it facetiously; but presentcircumstances proscribed the facetious. He simply fell back in hischair and returned his father's appealing gaze.</p><p>"If I, with a wife who hasn't been very fond of me, have had a veryhappy life," said the old man, carrying his ingenuity further still,"what a life mightn't you have if you should marry a person differentfrom Mrs. Touchett. There are more different from her than there arelike her." Ralph still said nothing; and after a pause his fatherresumed softly: "What do you think of your cousin?"</p><p>At this Ralph started, meeting the question with a strained smile. "Do I understand you to propose that I should marry Isabel?"</p><p>"Well, that's what it comes to in the end. Don't you like Isabel?"</p><p>"Yes, very much." And Ralph got up from his chair and wandered overto the fire. He stood before it an instant and then he stooped andstirred it mechanically. "I like Isabel very much," he repeated.</p><p>"Well," said his father, "I know she likes you. She has told me how much she likes you."</p><p>"Did she remark that she would like to marry me?"</p><p>"No, but she can't have anything against you. And she's the mostcharming young lady I've ever seen. And she would be good to you. Ihave thought a great deal about it."</p><p>"So have I," said Ralph, coming back to the bedside again. "I don't mind telling you that."</p><p>"You ARE in love with her then? I should think you would be. It's as if she came over on purpose."</p><p>"No, I'm not in love with her; but I should be if--if certain things were different."</p><p>"Ah, things are always different from what they might be," said theold man. "If you wait for them to change you'll never do anything. Idon't know whether you know," he went on; "but I suppose there's noharm in my alluding to it at such an hour as this: there was some onewanted to marry Isabel the other day, and she wouldn't have him."</p><p>"I know she refused Warburton: he told me himself."</p><p>"Well, that proves there's a chance for somebody else."</p><p>"Somebody else took his chance the other day in London--and got nothing by it."</p><p>"Was it you?" Mr. Touchett eagerly asked.</p><p>"No, it was an older friend; a poor gentleman who came over from America to see about it."</p><p>"Well, I'm sorry for him, whoever he was. But it only proves what I say--that the way's open to you."</p><p>"If it is, dear father, it's all the greater pity that I'm unable totread it. I haven't many convictions; but I have three or four that Ihold strongly. One is that people, on the whole, had better not marrytheir cousins. Another is that people in an advanced stage of pulmonarydisorder had better not marry at all."</p><p>The old man raised his weak hand and moved it to and fro before hisface. "What do you mean by that? You look at things in a way that wouldmake everything wrong. What sort of a cousin is a cousin that you hadnever seen for more than twenty years of her life? We're all eachother's cousins, and if we stopped at that the human race would dieout. It's just the same with your bad lung. You're a great deal betterthan you used to be. All you want is to lead a natural life. It is agreat deal more natural to marry a pretty young lady that you're inlove with than it is to remain single on false principles."</p><p>"I'm not in love with Isabel," said Ralph.</p><p>"You said just now that you would be if you didn't think it wrong. I want to prove to you that it isn't wrong."</p><p>"It will only tire you, dear daddy," said Ralph, who marvelled athis father's tenacity and at his finding strength to insist. "Thenwhere shall we all be?"</p><p>"Where shall you be if I don't provide for you? You won't haveanything to do with the bank, and you won't have me to take care of.You say you've so many interests; but I can't make them out."</p><p>Ralph leaned back in his chair with folded arms; his eyes were fixedfor some time in meditation. At last, with the air of a man fairlymustering courage, "I take a great interest in my cousin," he said,"but not the sort of interest you desire. I shall not live many years;but I hope I shall live long enough to see what she does with herself.She's entirely independent of me; I can exercise very little influenceupon her life. But I should like to do something for her."</p><p>"What should you like to do?"</p><p>"I should like to put a little wind in her sails."</p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p>"I should like to put it into her power to do some of the things shewants. She wants to see the world for instance. I should like to putmoney in her purse."</p><p>"Ah, I'm glad you've thought of that," said the old man. "But I'vethought of it too. I've left her a legacy--five thousand pounds."</p><p>"That's capital; it's very kind of you. But I should like to do a little more."</p><p>Something of that veiled acuteness with which it had been on DanielTouchett's part the habit of a lifetime to listen to a financialproposition still lingered in the face in which the invalid had notobliterated the man of business. "I shall be happy to consider it," hesaid softly.</p><p>"Isabel's poor then. My mother tells me that she has but a few hundred dollars a year. I should like to make her rich."</p><p>"What do you mean by rich?"</p><p>"I call people rich when they're able to meet the requirements of their imagination. Isabel has a great deal of imagination."</p><p>"So have you, my son," said Mr. Touchett, listening very attentively but a little confusedly.</p><p>"You tell me I shall have money enough for two. What I want is thatyou should kindly relieve me of my superfluity and make it over toIsabel. Divide my inheritance into two equal halves and give her thesecond."</p><p>"To do what she likes with?"</p><p>"Absolutely what she likes."</p><p>"And without an equivalent?"</p><p>"What equivalent could there be?"</p><p>"The one I've already mentioned."</p><p>"Her marrying--some one or other? It's just to do away with anythingof that sort that I make my suggestion. If she has an easy incomeshe'll never have to marry for a support. That's what I want cannily toprevent. She wishes to be free, and your bequest will make her free."</p><p>"Well, you seem to have thought it out," said Mr. Touchett. "But Idon't see why you appeal to me. The money will be yours, and you caneasily give it to her yourself."</p><p>Ralph openly stared. "Ah, dear father, I can't offer Isabel money!"</p><p>The old man gave a groan. "Don't tell me you're not in love with her! Do you want me to have the credit of it?"</p><p>"Entirely. I should like it simply to be a clause in your will, without the slightest reference to me."</p><p>"Do you want me to make a new will then?"</p><p>"A few words will do it; you can attend to it the next time you feel a little lively."</p><p>"You must telegraph to Mr. Hilary then. I'll do nothing without my solicitor."</p><p>"You shall see Mr. Hilary to-morrow."</p><p>"He'll think we've quarrelled, you and I," said the old man.</p><p>"Very probably; I shall like him to think it," said Ralph, smiling;"and, to carry out the idea, I give you notice that I shall be verysharp, quite horrid and strange, with you."</p><p>The humour of this appeared to touch his father, who lay a littlewhile taking it in. "I'll do anything you like," Mr. Touchett said atlast; "but I'm not sure it's right. You say you want to put wind in hersails; but aren't you afraid of putting too much?"</p><p>"I should like to see her going before the breeze!" Ralph answered.</p><p>"You speak as if it were for your mere amusement."</p><p>"So it is, a good deal."</p><p>"Well, I don't think I understand," said Mr. Touchett with a sigh."Young men are very different from what I was. When I cared for agirl--when I was young--I wanted to do more than look at her."</p><p>"You've scruples that I shouldn't have had, and you've ideas that Ishouldn't have had either. You say Isabel wants to be free, and thather being rich will keep her from marrying for money. Do you think thatshe's a girl to do that?"</p><p>"By no means. But she has less money than she has ever had before.Her father then gave her everything, because he used to spend hiscapital. She has nothing but the crumbs of that feast to live on, andshe doesn't really know how meagre they are--she has yet to learn it.My mother has told me all about it. Isabel will learn it when she'sreally thrown upon the world, and it would be very painful to me tothink of her coming to the consciousness of a lot of wants she shouldbe unable to satisfy."</p><p>"I've left her five thousand pounds. She can satisfy a good many wants with that."</p><p>"She can indeed. But she would probably spend it in two or three years."</p><p>"You think she'd be extravagant then?"</p><p>"Most certainly," said Ralph, smiling serenely.</p><p>Poor Mr. Touchett's acuteness was rapidly giving place to pureconfusion. "It would merely be a question of time then, her spendingthe larger sum?"</p><p>"No--though at first I think she'd plunge into that pretty freely:she'd probably make over a part of it to each of her sisters. But afterthat she'd come to her senses, remember she has still a lifetime beforeher, and live within her means."</p><p>"Well, you HAVE worked it out," said the old man helplessly. "You do take an interest in her, certainly."</p><p>"You can't consistently say I go too far. You wished me to go further."</p><p>"Well, I don't know," Mr. Touchett answered. "I don't think I enter into your spirit. It seems to me immoral."</p><p>"Immoral, dear daddy?"</p><p>"Well, I don't know that it's right to make everything so easy for a person."</p><p>"It surely depends upon the person. When the person's good, yourmaking things easy is all to the credit of virtue. To facilitate theexecution of good impulses, what can be a nobler act?"</p><p>This was a little difficult to follow, and Mr. Touchett consideredit for a while. At last he said: "Isabel's a sweet young thing; but doyou think she's so good as that?"</p><p>"She's as good as her best opportunities," Ralph returned.</p><p>"Well," Mr. Touchett declared, "she ought to get a great many opportunities for sixty thousand pounds."</p><p>"I've no doubt she will."</p><p>"Of course I'll do what you want," said the old man. "I only want to understand it a little."</p><p>"Well, dear daddy, don't you understand it now?" his son caressinglyasked. "If you don't we won't take any more trouble about it. We'llleave it alone."</p><p>Mr. Touchett lay a long time still. Ralph supposed he had given upthe attempt to follow. But at last, quite lucidly, he began again."Tell me this first. Doesn't it occur to you that a young lady withsixty thousand pounds may fall a victim to the fortune-hunters?"</p><p>"She'll hardly fall a victim to more than one."</p><p>"Well, one's too many."</p><p>"Decidedly. That's a risk, and it has entered into my calculation. Ithink it's appreciable, but I think it's small, and I'm prepared totake it."</p><p>Poor Mr. Touchett's acuteness had passed into perplexity, and hisperplexity now passed into admiration. "Well, you have gone into it!"he repeated. "But I don't see what good you're to get of it."</p><p>Ralph leaned over his father's pillows and gently smoothed them; hewas aware their talk had been unduly prolonged. "I shall get just thegood I said a few moments ago I wished to put into Isabel's reach--thatof having met the requirements of my imagination. But it's scandalous,the way I've taken advantage of you!"</p></span><span id = 968 >As Mrs. Touchett had foretold, Isabel and Madame Merle were thrown much together during the illness of their host, so that if they had not become intimate it would have been almost a breach of good manners. Their manners were of the best, but in addition to this they happened to please each other. It is perhaps too much to say that they swore an eternal friendship, but tacitly at least they called the future to witness. Isabel did so with a perfectly good conscience, though she would have hesitated to admit she was intimate with her new friend in the high sense she privately attached to this term. She often wondered indeed if she ever had been, or ever could be, intimate with any one. She had an ideal of friendship as well as of several other sentiments, which it failed to seem to her in this case--it had not seemed to her in other cases--that the actual completely expressed. But she often reminded herself that there were essential reasons why one's ideal could never become concrete. It was a thing to believe in, not to see--a matter of faith, not of experience. Experience, however, might supply us with very creditable imitations of it, and the part of wisdom was to make the best of these. Certainly, on the whole, Isabel had never encountered a more agreeable and interesting figure than Madame Merle; she had never met a person having less of that fault which is the principal obstacle to friendship--the air of reproducing the more tiresome, the stale, the too-familiar parts of one's own character. The gates of the girl's confidence were opened wider than they had ever been; she said things to this amiable auditress that she had not yet said to any one. Sometimes she took alarm at her candour: it was as if she had given to a comparative stranger the key to her cabinet of jewels. These spiritual gems were the only ones of any magnitude that Isabel possessed, but there was all the greater reason for their being carefully guarded. Afterwards, however, she always remembered that one should never regret a generous error and that if Madame Merle had not the merits she attributed to her, so much the worse for Madame Merle. There was no doubt she had great merits--she was charming, sympathetic, intelligent, cultivated. More than this (for it had not been Isabel's ill-fortune to go through life without meeting in her own sex several persons of whom no less could fairly be said), she was rare, superior and preeminent. There are many amiable people in the world, and Madame Merle was far from being vulgarly good-natured and restlessly witty. She knew how to think--an accomplishment rare in women; and she had thought to very good purpose. Of course, too, she knew how to feel; Isabel couldn't have spent a week with her without being sure of that. This was indeed Madame Merle's great talent, her most perfect gift. Life had told upon her; she had felt it strongly, and it was part of the satisfaction to be taken in her society that when the girl talked of what she was pleased to call serious matters this lady understood her so easily and quickly. Emotion, it is true, had become with her rather historic; she made no secret of the fact that the fount of passion, thanks to having been rather violently tapped at one period, didn't flow quite so freely as of yore. She proposed moreover, as well as expected, to cease feeling; she freely admitted that of old she had been a little mad, and now she pretended to be perfectly sane.<br /><br />"I judge more than I used to," she said to Isabel, "but it seems to me one has earned the right. One can't judge till one's forty; before that we're too eager, too hard, too cruel, and in addition much too ignorant. I'm sorry for you; it will be a long time before you're forty. But every gain's a loss of some kind; I often think that after forty one can't really feel. The freshness, the quickness have certainly gone. You'll keep them longer than most people; it will be a great satisfaction to me to see you some years hence. I want to see what life makes of you. One thing's certain--it can't spoil you. It may pull you about horribly, but I defy it to break you up."<br /><br />Isabel received this assurance as a young soldier, still panting from a slight skirmish in which he has come off with honour, might receive a pat on the shoulder from his colonel. Like such a recognition of merit it seemed to come with authority. How could the lightest word do less on the part of a person who was prepared to say, of almost everything Isabel told her, "Oh, I've been in that, my dear; it passes, like everything else." On many of her interlocutors Madame Merle might have produced an irritating effect; it was disconcertingly difficult to surprise her. But Isabel, though by no means incapable of desiring to be effective, had not at present this impulse. She was too sincere, too interested in her judicious companion. And then moreover Madame Merle never said such things in the tone of triumph or of boastfulness; they dropped from her like cold confessions.<br /><br />A period of bad weather had settled upon Gardencourt; the days grew shorter and there was an end to the pretty tea-parties on the lawn. But our young woman had long indoor conversations with her fellow visitor, and in spite of the rain the two ladies often sallied forth for a walk, equipped with the defensive apparatus which the English climate and the English genius have between them brought to such perfection. Madame Merle liked almost everything, including the English rain. "There's always a little of it and never too much at once," she said; "and it never wets you and it always smells good." She declared that in England the pleasures of smell were great--that in this inimitable island there was a certain mixture of fog and beer and soot which, however odd it might sound, was the national aroma, and was most agreeable to the nostril; and she used to lift the sleeve of her British overcoat and bury her nose in it, inhaling the clear, fine scent of the wool. Poor Ralph Touchett, as soon as the autumn had begun to define itself, became almost a prisoner; in bad weather he was unable to step out of the house, and he used sometimes to stand at one of the windows with his hands in his pockets and, from a countenance half-rueful, half-critical, watch Isabel and Madame Merle as they walked down the avenue under a pair of umbrellas. The roads about Gardencourt were so firm, even in the worst weather, that the two ladies always came back with a healthy glow in their cheeks, looking at the soles of their neat, stout boots and declaring that their walk had done them inexpressible good. Before luncheon, always, Madame Merle was engaged; Isabel admired and envied her rigid possession of her morning. Our heroine had always passed for a person of resources and had taken a certain pride in being one; but she wandered, as by the wrong side of the wall of a private garden, round the enclosed talents, accomplishments, aptitudes of Madame Merle. She found herself desiring to emulate them, and in twenty such ways this lady presented herself as a model. "I should like awfully to be so!" Isabel secretly exclaimed, more than once, as one after another of her friend's fine aspects caught the light, and before long she knew that she had learned a lesson from a high authority. It took no great time indeed for her to feel herself, as the phrase is, under an influence. "What's the harm," she wondered, "so long as it's a good one? The more one's under a good influence the better. The only thing is to see our steps as we take them--to understand them as we go. That, no doubt, I shall always do. I needn't be afraid of becoming too pliable; isn't it my fault that I'm not pliable enough?" It is said that imitation is the sincerest flattery; and if Isabel was sometimes moved to gape at her friend aspiringly and despairingly it was not so much because she desired herself to shine as because she wished to hold up the lamp for Madame Merle. She liked her extremely, but was even more dazzled than attracted. She sometimes asked herself what Henrietta Stackpole would say to her thinking so much of this perverted product of their common soil, and had a conviction that it would be severely judged. Henrietta would not at all subscribe to Madame Merle; for reasons she could not have defined this truth came home to the girl. On the other hand she was equally sure that, should the occasion offer, her new friend would strike off some happy view of her old: Madame Merle was too humorous, too observant, not to do justice to Henrietta, and on becoming acquainted with her would probably give the measure of a tact which Miss Stackpole couldn't hope to emulate. She appeared to have in her experience a touchstone for everything, and somewhere in the capacious pocket of her genial memory she would find the key to Henrietta's value. "That's the great thing," Isabel solemnly pondered; "that's the supreme good fortune: to be in a better position for appreciating people than they are for appreciating you." And she added that such, when one considered it, was simply the essence of the aristocratic situation. In this light, if in none other, one should aim at the aristocratic situation.<br /><br />I may not count over all the links in the chain which led Isabel to think of Madame Merle's situation as aristocratic--a view of it never expressed in any reference made to it by that lady herself. She had known great things and great people, but she had never played a great part. She was one of the small ones of the earth; she had not been born to honours; she knew the world too well to nourish fatuous illusions on the article of her own place in it. She had encountered many of the fortunate few and was perfectly aware of those points at which their fortune differed from hers. But if by her informed measure she was no figure for a high scene, she had yet to Isabel's imagination a sort of greatness. To be so cultivated and civilised, so wise and so easy, and still make so light of it--that was really to be a great lady, especially when one so carried and presented one's self. It was as if somehow she had all society under contribution, and all the arts and graces it practised--or was the effect rather that of charming uses found for her, even from a distance, subtle service rendered by her to a clamorous world wherever she might be? After breakfast she wrote a succession of letters, as those arriving for her appeared innumerable: her correspondence was a source of surprise to Isabel when they sometimes walked together to the village post-office to deposit Madame Merle's offering to the mail. She knew more people, as she told Isabel, than she knew what to do with, and something was always turning up to be written about. Of painting she was devotedly fond, and made no more of brushing in a sketch than of pulling off her gloves. At Gardencourt she was perpetually taking advantage of an hour's sunshine to go out with a camp-stool and a box of water-colours. That she was a brave musician we have already perceived, and it was evidence of the fact that when she seated herself at the piano, as she always did in the evening, her listeners resigned themselves without a murmur to losing the grace of her talk. Isabel, since she had known her, felt ashamed of her own facility, which she now looked upon as basely inferior; and indeed, though she had been thought rather a prodigy at home, the loss to society when, in taking her place upon the music-stool, she turned her back to the room, was usually deemed greater than the gain. When Madame Merle was neither writing, nor painting, nor touching the piano, she was usually employed upon wonderful tasks of rich embroidery, cushions, curtains, decorations for the chimneypiece; an art in which her bold, free invention was as noted as the agility of her needle. She was never idle, for when engaged in none of the ways I have mentioned she was either reading (she appeared to Isabel to read "everything important"), or walking out, or playing patience with the cards, or talking with her fellow inmates. And with all this she had always the social quality, was never rudely absent and yet never too seated. She laid down her pastimes as easily as she took them up; she worked and talked at the same time, and appeared to impute scant worth to anything she did. She gave away her sketches and tapestries; she rose from the piano or remained there, according to the convenience of her auditors, which she always unerringly divined. She was in short the most comfortable, profitable, amenable person to live with. If for Isabel she had a fault it was that she was not natural; by which the girl meant, not that she was either affected or pretentious, since from these vulgar vices no woman could have been more exempt, but that her nature had been too much overlaid by custom and her angles too much rubbed away. She had become too flexible, too useful, was too ripe and too final. She was in a word too perfectly the social animal that man and woman are supposed to have been intended to be; and she had rid herself of every remnant of that tonic wildness which we may assume to have belonged even to the most amiable persons in the ages before country-house life was the fashion. Isabel found it difficult to think of her in any detachment or privacy, she existed only in her relations, direct or indirect, with her fellow mortals. One might wonder what commerce she could possibly hold with her own spirit. One always ended, however, by feeling that a charming surface doesn't necessarily prove one superficial; this was an illusion in which, in one's youth, one had but just escaped being nourished. Madame Merle was not superficial--not she. She was deep, and her nature spoke none the less in her behaviour because it spoke a conventional tongue. "What's language at all but a convention?" said Isabel. "She has the good taste not to pretend, like some people I've met, to express herself by original signs."<br /><br />"I'm afraid you've suffered much," she once found occasion to say to her friend in response to some allusion that had appeared to reach far.<br /><br />"What makes you think that?" Madame Merle asked with the amused smile of a person seated at a game of guesses. "I hope I haven't too much the droop of the misunderstood."<br /><br />"No; but you sometimes say things that I think people who have always been happy wouldn't have found out."<br /><br />"I haven't always been happy," said Madame Merle, smiling still, but with a mock gravity, as if she were telling a child a secret. "Such a wonderful thing!"<br /><br />But Isabel rose to the irony. "A great many people give me the impression of never having for a moment felt anything."<br /><br />"It's very true; there are many more iron pots certainly than porcelain. But you may depend on it that every one bears some mark; even the hardest iron pots have a little bruise, a little hole somewhere. I flatter myself that I'm rather stout, but if I must tell you the truth I've been shockingly chipped and cracked. I do very well for service yet, because I've been cleverly mended; and I try to remain in the cupboard--the quiet, dusky cupboard where there's an odour of stale spices--as much as I can. But when I've to come out and into a strong light--then, my dear, I'm a horror!"<br /><br />I know not whether it was on this occasion or on some other that the conversation had taken the turn I have just indicated she said to Isabel that she would some day a tale unfold. Isabel assured her she should delight to listen to one, and reminded her more than once of this engagement. Madame Merle, however, begged repeatedly for a respite, and at last frankly told her young companion that they must wait till they knew each other better. This would be sure to happen, a long friendship so visibly lay before them. Isabel assented, but at the same time enquired if she mightn't be trusted--if she appeared capable of a betrayal of confidence.<br /><br />"It's not that I'm afraid of your repeating what I say," her fellow visitor answered; "I'm afraid, on the contrary, of your taking it too much to yourself. You'd judge me too harshly; you're of the cruel age." She preferred for the present to talk to Isabel of Isabel, and exhibited the greatest interest in our heroine's history, sentiments, opinions, prospects. She made her chatter and listened to her chatter with infinite good nature. This flattered and quickened the girl, who was struck with all the distinguished people her friend had known and with her having lived, as Mrs. Touchett said, in the best company in Europe. Isabel thought the better of herself for enjoying the favour of a person who had so large a field of comparison; and it was perhaps partly to gratify the sense of profiting by comparison that she often appealed to these stores of reminiscence. Madame Merle had been a dweller in many lands and had social ties in a dozen different countries. "I don't pretend to be educated," she would say, "but I think I know my Europe;" and she spoke one day of going to Sweden to stay with an old friend, and another of proceeding to Malta to follow up a new acquaintance. With England, where she had often dwelt, she was thoroughly familiar, and for Isabel's benefit threw a great deal of light upon the customs of the country and the character of the people, who "after all," as she was fond of saying, were the most convenient in the world to live with.<br /><br />"You mustn't think it strange her remaining here at such a time as this, when Mr. Touchett's passing away," that gentleman's wife remarked to her niece. "She is incapable of a mistake; she's the most tactful woman I know. It's a favour to me that she stays; she's putting off a lot of visits at great houses," said Mrs. Touchett, who never forgot that when she herself was in England her social value sank two or three degrees in the scale. "She has her pick of places; she's not in want of a shelter. But I've asked her to put in this time because I wish you to know her. I think it will be a good thing for you. Serena Merle hasn't a fault."<br /><br />"If I didn't already like her very much that description might alarm me," Isabel returned.<br /><br />"She's never the least little bit 'off.' I've brought you out here and I wish to do the best for you. Your sister Lily told me she hoped I would give you plenty of opportunities. I give you one in putting you in relation with Madame Merle. She's one of the most brilliant women in Europe."<br /><br />"I like her better than I like your description of her," Isabel persisted in saying.<br /><br />"Do you flatter yourself that you'll ever feel her open to criticism? I hope you'll let me know when you do."<br /><br />"That will be cruel--to you," said Isabel.<br /><br />"You needn't mind me. You won't discover a fault in her."<br /><br />"Perhaps not. But I dare say I shan't miss it."<br /><br />"She knows absolutely everything on earth there is to know," said Mrs. Touchett.<br /><br />Isabel after this observed to their companion that she hoped she knew Mrs. Touchett considered she hadn't a speck on her perfection. On which "I'm obliged to you," Madame Merle replied, "but I'm afraid your aunt imagines, or at least alludes to, no aberrations that the clock-face doesn't register."<br /><br />"So that you mean you've a wild side that's unknown to her?"<br /><br />"Ah no, I fear my darkest sides are my tamest. I mean that having no faults, for your aunt, means that one's never late for dinner --that is for her dinner. I was not late, by the way, the other day, when you came back from London; the clock was just at eight when I came into the drawing-room: it was the rest of you that were before the time. It means that one answers a letter the day one gets it and that when one comes to stay with her one doesn't bring too much luggage and is careful not to be taken ill. For Mrs. Touchett those things constitute virtue; it's a blessing to be able to reduce it to its elements."<br /><br />Madame Merle's own conversation, it will be perceived, was enriched with bold, free touches of criticism, which, even when they had a restrictive effect, never struck Isabel as ill-natured. It couldn't occur to the girl for instance that Mrs. Touchett's accomplished guest was abusing her; and this for very good reasons. In the first place Isabel rose eagerly to the sense of her shades; in the second Madame Merle implied that there was a great deal more to say; and it was clear in the third that for a person to speak to one without ceremony of one's near relations was an agreeable sign of that person's intimacy with one's self. These signs of deep communion multiplied as the days elapsed, and there was none of which Isabel was more sensible than of her companion's preference for making Miss Archer herself a topic. Though she referred frequently to the incidents of her own career she never lingered upon them; she was as little of a gross egotist as she was of a flat gossip.<br /><br />"I'm old and stale and faded," she said more than once; "I'm of no more interest than last week's newspaper. You're young and fresh and of to-day; you've the great thing--you've actuality. I once had it--we all have it for an hour. You, however, will have it for longer. Let us talk about you then; you can say nothing I shall not care to hear. It's a sign that I'm growing old--that I like to talk with younger people. I think it's a very pretty compensation. If we can't have youth within us we can have it outside, and I really think we see it and feel it better that way. Of course we must be in sympathy with it--that I shall always be. I don't know that I shall ever be ill-natured with old people--I hope not; there are certainly some old people I adore. But I shall never be anything but abject with the young; they touch me and appeal to me too much. I give you carte blanche then; you can even be impertinent if you like; I shall let it pass and horribly spoil you. I speak as if I were a hundred years old, you say? Well, I am, if you please; I was born before the French Revolution. Ah, my dear, je viens de loin; I belong to the old, old world. But it's not of that I want to talk; I want to talk about the new. You must tell me more about America; you never tell me enough. Here I've been since I was brought here as a helpless child, and it's ridiculous, or rather it's scandalous, how little I know about that splendid, dreadful, funny country-- surely the greatest and drollest of them all. There are a great many of us like that in these parts, and I must say I think we're a wretched set of people. You should live in your own land; whatever it may be you have your natural place there. If we're not good Americans we're certainly poor Europeans; we've no natural place here. We're mere parasites, crawling over the surface; we haven't our feet in the soil. At least one can know it and not have illusions. A woman perhaps can get on; a woman, it seems to me, has no natural place anywhere; wherever she finds herself she has to remain on the surface and, more or less, to crawl. You protest, my dear? you're horrified? you declare you'll never crawl? It's very true that I don't see you crawling; you stand more upright than a good many poor creatures. Very good; on the whole, I don't think you'll crawl. But the men, the Americans; je vous demande un peu, what do they make of it over here? I don't envy them trying to arrange themselves. Look at poor Ralph Touchett: what sort of a figure do you call that? Fortunately he has a consumption; I say fortunately, because it gives him something to do. His consumption's his carriere it's a kind of position. You can say: 'Oh, Mr. Touchett, he takes care of his lungs, he knows a great deal about climates.' But without that who would he be, what would he represent? 'Mr. Ralph Touchett: an American who lives in Europe.' That signifies absolutely nothing--it's impossible anything should signify less. 'He's very cultivated,' they say: 'he has a very pretty collection of old snuff-boxes.' The collection is all that's wanted to make it pitiful. I'm tired of the sound of the word; I think it's grotesque. With the poor old father it's different; he has his identity, and it's rather a massive one. He represents a great financial house, and that, in our day, is as good as anything else. For an American, at any rate, that will do very well. But I persist in thinking your cousin very lucky to have a chronic malady so long as he doesn't die of it. It's much better than the snuffboxes. If he weren't ill, you say, he'd do something?--he'd take his father's place in the house. My poor child, I doubt it; I don't think he's at all fond of the house. However, you know him better than I, though I used to know him rather well, and he may have the benefit of the doubt. The worst case, I think, is a friend of mine, a countryman of ours, who lives in Italy (where he also was brought before he knew better), and who is one of the most delightful men I know. Some day you must know him. I'll bring you together and then you'll see what I mean. He's Gilbert Osmond--he lives in Italy; that's all one can say about him or make of him. He's exceedingly clever, a man made to be distinguished; but, as I tell you, you exhaust the description when you say he's Mr. Osmond who lives tout betement in Italy. No career, no name, no position, no fortune, no past, no future, no anything. Oh yes, he paints, if you please--paints in water-colours; like me, only better than I. His painting's pretty bad; on the whole I'm rather glad of that. Fortunately he's very indolent, so indolent that it amounts to a sort of position. He can say, 'Oh, I do nothing; I'm too deadly lazy. You can do nothing to-day unless you get up at five o'clock in the morning.' In that way he becomes a sort of exception; you feel he might do something if he'd only rise early. He never speaks of his painting to people at large; he's too clever for that. But he has a little girl--a dear little girl; he does speak of her. He's devoted to her, and if it were a career to be an excellent father he'd be very distinguished. But I'm afraid that's no better than the snuff-boxes; perhaps not even so good. Tell me what they do in America," pursued Madame Merle, who, it must be observed parenthetically, did not deliver herself all at once of these reflexions, which are presented in a cluster for the convenience of the reader. She talked of Florence, where Mr. Osmond lived and where Mrs. Touchett occupied a medieval palace; she talked of Rome, where she herself had a little pied-a-terre with some rather good old damask. She talked of places, of people and even, as the phrase is, of "subjects"; and from time to time she talked of their kind old host and of the prospect of his recovery. From the first she had thought this prospect small, and Isabel had been struck with the positive, discriminating, competent way in which she took the measure of his remainder of life. One evening she announced definitely that he wouldn't live.<br /><br />"Sir Matthew Hope told me so as plainly as was proper," she said; "standing there, near the fire, before dinner. He makes himself very agreeable, the great doctor. I don't mean his saying that has anything to do with it. But he says such things with great tact. I had told him I felt ill at my ease, staying here at such a time; it seemed to me so indiscreet--it wasn't as if I could nurse. 'You must remain, you must remain,' he answered; 'your office will come later.' Wasn't that a very delicate way of saying both that poor Mr. Touchett would go and that I might be of some use as a consoler? In fact, however, I shall not be of the slightest use. Your aunt will console herself; she, and she alone, knows just how much consolation she'll require. It would be a very delicate matter for another person to undertake to administer the dose. With your cousin it will be different; he'll miss his father immensely. But I should never presume to condole with Mr. Ralph; we're not on those terms." Madame Merle had alluded more than once to some undefined incongruity in her relations with Ralph Touchett; so Isabel took this occasion of asking her if they were not good friends.<br /><br />"Perfectly, but he doesn't like me."<br /><br />"What have you done to him?"<br /><br />"Nothing whatever. But one has no need of a reason for that."<br /><br />"For not liking you? I think one has need of a very good reason."<br /><br />"You're very kind. Be sure you have one ready for the day you begin."<br /><br />"Begin to dislike you? I shall never begin."<br /><br />"I hope not; because if you do you'll never end. That's the way with your cousin; he doesn't get over it. It's an antipathy of nature--if I can call it that when it's all on his side. I've nothing whatever against him and don't bear him the least little grudge for not doing me justice. Justice is all I want. However, one feels that he's a gentleman and would never say anything underhand about one. Cartes sur table," Madame Merle subjoined in a moment, "I'm not afraid of him."<br /><br />"I hope not indeed," said Isabel, who added something about his being the kindest creature living. She remembered, however, that on her first asking him about Madame Merle he had answered her in a manner which this lady might have thought injurious without being explicit. There was something between them, Isabel said to herself, but she said nothing more than this. If it were something of importance it should inspire respect; if it were not it was not worth her curiosity. With all her love of knowledge she had a natural shrinking from raising curtains and looking into unlighted corners. The love of knowledge coexisted in her mind with the finest capacity for ignorance.<br /><br />But Madame Merle sometimes said things that startled her, made her raise her clear eyebrows at the time and think of the words afterwards. "I'd give a great deal to be your age again," she broke out once with a bitterness which, though diluted in her customary amplitude of ease, was imperfectly disguised by it. "If I could only begin again--if I could have my life before me!"<br /><br />"Your life's before you yet," Isabel answered gently, for she was vaguely awe-struck.<br /><br />"No; the best part's gone, and gone for nothing."<br /><br />"Surely not for nothing," said Isabel.<br /><br />"Why not--what have I got? Neither husband, nor child, nor fortune, nor position, nor the traces of a beauty that I never had."<br /><br />"You have many friends, dear lady."<br /><br />"I'm not so sure!" cried Madame Merle.<br /><br />"Ah, you're wrong. You have memories, graces, talents--"<br /><br />But Madame Merle interrupted her. "What have my talents brought me? Nothing but the need of using them still, to get through the hours, the years, to cheat myself with some pretence of movement, of unconsciousness. As for my graces and memories the less said about them the better. You'll be my friend till you find a better use for your friendship."<br /><br />"It will be for you to see that I don't then," said Isabel.<br /><br />"Yes; I would make an effort to keep you." And her companion looked at her gravely. "When I say I should like to be your age I mean with your qualities--frank, generous, sincere like you. In that case I should have made something better of my life."<br /><br />"What should you have liked to do that you've not done?"<br /><br />Madame Merle took a sheet of music--she was seated at the piano and had abruptly wheeled about on the stool when she first spoke --and mechanically turned the leaves. "I'm very ambitious!" she at last replied.<br /><br />"And your ambitions have not been satisfied? They must have been great."<br /><br />"They WERE great. I should make myself ridiculous by talking of them."<br /><br />Isabel wondered what they could have been--whether Madame Merle had aspired to wear a crown. "I don't know what your idea of success may be, but you seem to me to have been successful. To me indeed you're a vivid image of success."<br /><br />Madame Merle tossed away the music with a smile. "What's YOUR idea of success?"<br /><br />"You evidently think it must be a very tame one. It's to see some dream of one's youth come true."<br /><br />"Ah," Madame Merle exclaimed, "that I've never seen! But my dreams were so great--so preposterous. Heaven forgive me, I'm dreaming now!" And she turned back to the piano and began grandly to play. On the morrow she said to Isabel that her definition of success had been very pretty, yet frightfully sad. Measured in that way, who had ever succeeded? The dreams of one's youth, why they were enchanting, they were divine! Who had ever seen such things come to pass?<br /><br />"I myself--a few of them," Isabel ventured to answer.<br /><br />"Already? They must have been dreams of yesterday."<br /><br />"I began to dream very young," Isabel smiled.<br /><br />"Ah, if you mean the aspirations of your childhood--that of having a pink sash and a doll that could close her eyes."<br /><br />"No, I don't mean that."<br /><br />"Or a young man with a fine moustache going down on his knees to you."<br /><br />"No, nor that either," Isabel declared with still more emphasis.<br /><br />Madame Merle appeared to note this eagerness. "I suspect that's what you do mean. We've all had the young man with the moustache. He's the inevitable young man; he doesn't count."<br /><br />Isabel was silent a little but then spoke with extreme and characteristic inconsequence. "Why shouldn't he count? There are young men and young men."<br /><br />"And yours was a paragon--is that what you mean?" asked her friend with a laugh. "If you've had the identical young man you dreamed of, then that was success, and I congratulate you with all my heart. Only in that case why didn't you fly with him to his castle in the Apennines?"<br /><br />"He has no castle in the Apennines."<br /><br />"What has he? An ugly brick house in Fortieth Street? Don't tell me that; I refuse to recognise that as an ideal."<br /><br />"I don't care anything about his house," said Isabel.<br /><br />"That's very crude of you. When you've lived as long as I you'll see that every human being has his shell and that you must take the shell into account. By the shell I mean the whole envelope of circumstances. There's no such thing as an isolated man or woman; we're each of us made up of some cluster of appurtenances. What shall we call our 'self'? Where does it begin? where does it end? It overflows into everything that belongs to us--and then it flows back again. I know a large part of myself is in the clothes I choose to wear. I've a great respect for THINGS! One's self-- for other people--is one's expression of one's self; and one's house, one's furniture, one's garments, the books one reads, the company one keeps--these things are all expressive."<br /><br />This was very metaphysical; not more so, however, than several observations Madame Merle had already made. Isabel was fond of metaphysics, but was unable to accompany her friend into this bold analysis of the human personality. "I don't agree with you. I think just the other way. I don't know whether I succeed in expressing myself, but I know that nothing else expresses me. Nothing that belongs to me is any measure of me; everything's on the contrary a limit, a barrier, and a perfectly arbitrary one. Certainly the clothes which, as you say, I choose to wear, don't express me; and heaven forbid they should!"<br /><br />"You dress very well," Madame Merle lightly interposed.<br /><br />"Possibly; but I don't care to be judged by that. My clothes may express the dressmaker, but they don't express me. To begin with it's not my own choice that I wear them; they're imposed upon me by society."<br /><br />"Should you prefer to go without them?" Madame Merle enquired in a tone which virtually terminated the discussion.<br /><br />I am bound to confess, though it may cast some discredit on the sketch I have given of the youthful loyalty practised by our heroine toward this accomplished woman, that Isabel had said nothing whatever to her about Lord Warburton and had been equally reticent on the subject of Caspar Goodwood. She had not, however, concealed the fact that she had had opportunities of marrying and had even let her friend know of how advantageous a kind they had been. Lord Warburton had left Lockleigh and was gone to Scotland, taking his sisters with him; and though he had written to Ralph more than once to ask about Mr. Touchett's health the girl was not liable to the embarrassment of such enquiries as, had he still been in the neighbourhood, he would probably have felt bound to make in person. He had excellent ways, but she felt sure that if he had come to Gardencourt he would have seen Madame Merle, and that if he had seen her he would have liked her and betrayed to her that he was in love with her young friend. It so happened that during this lady's previous visits to Gardencourt-- each of them much shorter than the present--he had either not been at Lockleigh or had not called at Mr. Touchett's. Therefore, though she knew him by name as the great man of that county, she had no cause to suspect him as a suitor of Mrs. Touchett's freshly-imported niece.<br /><br />"You've plenty of time," she had said to Isabel in return for the mutilated confidences which our young woman made her and which didn't pretend to be perfect, though we have seen that at moments the girl had compunctions at having said so much. "I'm glad you've done nothing yet--that you have it still to do. It's a very good thing for a girl to have refused a few good offers--so long of course as they are not the best she's likely to have. Pardon me if my tone seems horribly corrupt; one must take the worldly view sometimes. Only don't keep on refusing for the sake of refusing. It's a pleasant exercise of power; but accepting's after all an exercise of power as well. There's always the danger of refusing once too often. It was not the one I fell into--I didn't refuse often enough. You're an exquisite creature, and I should like to see you married to a prime minister. But speaking strictly, you know, you're not what is technically called a parti. You're extremely good-looking and extremely clever; in yourself you're quite exceptional. You appear to have the vaguest ideas about your earthly possessions; but from what I can make out you're not embarrassed with an income. I wish you had a little money."<br /><br />"I wish I had!" said Isabel, simply, apparently forgetting for the moment that her poverty had been a venial fault for two gallant gentlemen.<br /><br />In spite of Sir Matthew Hope's benevolent recommendation Madame Merle did not remain to the end, as the issue of poor Mr. Touchett's malady had now come frankly to be designated. She was under pledges to other people which had at last to be redeemed, and she left Gardencourt with the understanding that she should in any event see Mrs. Touchett there again, or else in town, before quitting England. Her parting with Isabel was even more like the beginning of a friendship than their meeting had been. "I'm going to six places in succession, but I shall see no one I like so well as you. They'll all be old friends, however; one doesn't make new friends at my age. I've made a great exception for you. You must remember that and must think as well of me as possible. You must reward me by believing in me."<br /><br />By way of answer Isabel kissed her, and, though some women kiss with facility, there are kisses and kisses, and this embrace was satisfactory to Madame Merle. Our young lady, after this, was much alone; she saw her aunt and cousin only at meals, and discovered that of the hours during which Mrs. Touchett was invisible only a minor portion was now devoted to nursing her husband. She spent the rest in her own apartments, to which access was not allowed even to her niece, apparently occupied there with mysterious and inscrutable exercises. At table she was grave and silent; but her solemnity was not an attitude--Isabel could see it was a conviction. She wondered if her aunt repented of having taken her own way so much; but there was no visible evidence of this--no tears, no sighs, no exaggeration of a zeal always to its own sense adequate. Mrs. Touchett seemed simply to feel the need of thinking things over and summing them up; she had a little moral account-book--with columns unerringly ruled and a sharp steel clasp--which she kept with exemplary neatness. Uttered reflection had with her ever, at any rate, a practical ring. "If I had foreseen this I'd not have proposed your coming abroad now," she said to Isabel after Madame Merle had left the house. "I'd have waited and sent for you next year."<br /><br />"So that perhaps I should never have known my uncle? It's a great happiness to me to have come now."<br /><br />"That's very well. But it was not that you might know your uncle that I brought you to Europe." A perfectly veracious speech; but, as Isabel thought, not as perfectly timed. She had leisure to think of this and other matters. She took a solitary walk every day and spent vague hours in turning over books in the library. Among the subjects that engaged her attention were the adventures of her friend Miss Stackpole, with whom she was in regular correspondence. Isabel liked her friend's private epistolary style better than her public; that is she felt her public letters would have been excellent if they had not been printed. Henrietta's career, however, was not so successful as might have been wished even in the interest of her private felicity; that view of the inner life of Great Britain which she was so eager to take appeared to dance before her like an ignis fatuus. The invitation from Lady Pensil, for mysterious reasons, had never arrived; and poor Mr. Bantling himself, with all his friendly ingenuity, had been unable to explain so grave a dereliction on the part of a missive that had obviously been sent. He had evidently taken Henrietta's affairs much to heart, and believed that he owed her a set-off to this illusory visit to Bedfordshire. "He says he should think I would go to the Continent," Henrietta wrote; "and as he thinks of going there himself I suppose his advice is sincere. He wants to know why I don't take a view of French life; and it's a fact that I want very much to see the new Republic. Mr. Bantling doesn't care much about the Republic, but he thinks of going over to Paris anyway. I must say he's quite as attentive as I could wish, and at least I shall have seen one polite Englishman. I keep telling Mr. Bantling that he ought to have been an American, and you should see how that pleases him. Whenever I say so he always breaks out with the same exclamation-- 'Ah, but really, come now!" A few days later she wrote that she had decided to go to Paris at the end of the week and that Mr. Banding had promised to see her off--perhaps even would go as far as Dover with her. She would wait in Paris till Isabel should arrive, Henrietta added; speaking quite as if Isabel were to start on her continental journey alone and making no allusion to Mrs. Touchett. Bearing in mind his interest in their late companion, our heroine communicated several passages from this correspondence to Ralph, who followed with an emotion akin to suspense the career of the representative of the Interviewer.<br /><br />"It seems to me she's doing very well," he said, "going over to Paris with an ex-Lancer! If she wants something to write about she has only to describe that episode."<br /><br />"It's not conventional, certainly," Isabel answered; "but if you mean that--as far as Henrietta is concerned--it's not perfectly innocent, you're very much mistaken. You'll never understand Henrietta."<br /><br />"Pardon me, I understand her perfectly. I didn't at all at first, but now I've the point of view. I'm afraid, however, that Bantling hasn't; he may have some surprises. Oh, I understand Henrietta as well as if I had made her!"<br /><br />Isabel was by no means sure of this, but she abstained from expressing further doubt, for she was disposed in these days to extend a great charity to her cousin. One afternoon less than a week after Madame Merle's departure she was seated in the library with a volume to which her attention was not fastened. She had placed herself in a deep window-bench, from which she looked out into the dull, damp park; and as the library stood at right angles to the entrance-front of the house she could see the doctor's brougham, which had been waiting for the last two hours before the door. She was struck with his remaining so long, but at last she saw him appear in the portico, stand a moment slowly drawing on his gloves and looking at the knees of his horse, and then get into the vehicle and roll away. Isabel kept her place for half an hour; there was a great stillness in the house. It was so great that when she at last heard a soft, slow step on the deep carpet of the room she was almost startled by the sound. She turned quickly away from the window and saw Ralph Touchett standing there with his hands still in his pockets, but with a face absolutely void of its usual latent smile. She got up and her movement and glance were a question.<br /><br />"It's all over," said Ralph.<br /><br />"Do you mean that my uncle...?" And Isabel stopped.<br /><br />"My dear father died an hour ago."<br /><br />"Ah, my poor Ralph!" she gently wailed, putting out her two hands to him.<br /><br /></span><span id = 969 ><p>Some fortnight after this Madame Merle drove up in a hansom cab tothe house in Winchester Square. As she descended from her vehicle sheobserved, suspended between the dining-room windows, a large, neat,wooden tablet, on whose fresh black ground were inscribed in whitepaint the words--"This noble freehold mansion to be sold"; with thename of the agent to whom application should be made. "They certainlylose no time," said the visitor as, after sounding the big brassknocker, she waited to be admitted; "it's a practical country!" Andwithin the house, as she ascended to the drawing-room, she perceivednumerous signs of abdication; pictures removed from the walls andplaced upon sofas, windows undraped and floors laid bare. Mrs. Touchettpresently received her and intimated in a few words that condolencesmight be taken for granted.</p><p>"I know what you're going to say--he was a very good man. But I knowit better than any one, because I gave him more chance to show it. Inthat I think I was a good wife." Mrs. Touchett added that at the endher husband apparently recognised this fact. "He has treated me mostliberally," she said; "I won't say more liberally than I expected,because I didn't expect. You know that as a general thing I don'texpect. But he chose, I presume, to recognise the fact that though Ilived much abroad and mingled-- you may say freely--in foreign life, Inever exhibited the smallest preference for any one else."</p><p>"For any one but yourself," Madame Merle mentally observed; but the reflexion was perfectly inaudible.</p><p>"I never sacrificed my husband to another," Mrs. Touchett continued with her stout curtness.</p><p>"Oh no," thought Madame Merle; "you never did anything for another!"</p><p>There was a certain cynicism in these mute comments which demands anexplanation; the more so as they are not in accord either with theview--somewhat superficial perhaps--that we have hitherto enjoyed ofMadame Merle's character or with the literal facts of Mrs. Touchett'shistory; the more so, too, as Madame Merle had a well-foundedconviction that her friend's last remark was not in the least to beconstrued as a side-thrust at herself. The truth is that the moment shehad crossed the threshold she received an impression that Mr.Touchett's death had had subtle consequences and that theseconsequences had been profitable to a little circle of persons amongwhom she was not numbered. Of course it was an event which wouldnaturally have consequences; her imagination had more than once restedupon this fact during her stay at Gardencourt. But it had been onething to foresee such a matter mentally and another to stand among itsmassive records. The idea of a distribution of property--she wouldalmost have said of spoils--just now pressed upon her senses andirritated her with a sense of exclusion. I am far from wishing topicture her as one of the hungry mouths or envious hearts of thegeneral herd, but we have already learned of her having desires thathad never been satisfied. If she had been questioned, she would ofcourse have admitted--with a fine proud smile--that she had not thefaintest claim to a share in Mr. Touchett's relics. "There was neveranything in the world between us," she would have said. "There wasnever that, poor man!"--with a fillip of her thumb and her thirdfinger. I hasten to add, moreover, that if she couldn't at the presentmoment keep from quite perversely yearning she was careful not tobetray herself. She had after all as much sympathy for Mrs. Touchett'sgains as for her losses.</p><p>"He has left me this house," the newly-made widow said; "but ofcourse I shall not live in it; I've a much better one in Florence. Thewill was opened only three days since, but I've already offered thehouse for sale. I've also a share in the bank; but I don't yetunderstand if I'm obliged to leave it there. If not I shall certainlytake it out. Ralph, of course, has Gardencourt; but I'm not sure thathe'll have means to keep up the place. He's naturally left very welloff, but his father has given away an immense deal of money; there arebequests to a string of third cousins in Vermont. Ralph, however, isvery fond of Gardencourt and would be quite capable of living there--insummer--with a maid-of-all-work and a gardener's boy. There's oneremarkable clause in my husband's will," Mrs. Touchett added. "He hasleft my niece a fortune."</p><p>"A fortune!" Madame Merle softly repeated.</p><p>"Isabel steps into something like seventy thousand pounds." MadameMerle's hands were clasped in her lap; at this she raised them, stillclasped, and held them a moment against her bosom while her eyes, alittle dilated, fixed themselves on those of her friend. "Ah," shecried, "the clever creature!"</p><p>Mrs. Touchett gave her a quick look. "What do you mean by that?"</p><p>For an instant Madame Merle's colour rose and she dropped her eyes."It certainly is clever to achieve such results--without an effort!"</p><p>"There assuredly was no effort. Don't call it an achievement."</p><p>Madame Merle was seldom guilty of the awkwardness of retracting whatshe had said; her wisdom was shown rather in maintaining it and placingit in a favourable light. "My dear friend, Isabel would certainly nothave had seventy thousand pounds left her if she had not been the mostcharming girl in the world. Her charm includes great cleverness."</p><p>"She never dreamed, I'm sure, of my husband's doing anything forher; and I never dreamed of it either, for he never spoke to me of hisintention," Mrs. Touchett said. "She had no claim upon him whatever; itwas no great recommendation to him that she was my niece. Whatever sheachieved she achieved unconsciously."</p><p>"Ah," rejoined Madame Merle, "those are the greatest strokes!" Mrs.Touchett reserved her opinion. "The girl's fortunate; I don't denythat. But for the present she's simply stupefied."</p><p>"Do you mean that she doesn't know what to do with the money?"</p><p>"That, I think, she has hardly considered. She doesn't know what tothink about the matter at all. It has been as if a big gun weresuddenly fired off behind her; she's feeling herself to see if she behurt. It's but three days since she received a visit from the principalexecutor, who came in person, very gallantly, to notify her. He told meafterwards that when he had made his little speech she suddenly burstinto tears. The money's to remain in the affairs of the bank, and she'sto draw the interest."</p><p>Madame Merle shook her head with a wise and now quite benignantsmile. "How very delicious! After she has done that two or three timesshe'll get used to it." Then after a silence, "What does your son thinkof it?" she abruptly asked.</p><p>"He left England before the will was read--used up by his fatigueand anxiety and hurrying off to the south. He's on his way to theRiviera and I've not yet heard from him. But it's not likely he'll everobject to anything done by his father."</p><p>"Didn't you say his own share had been cut down?"</p><p>"Only at his wish. I know that he urged his father to do somethingfor the people in America. He's not in the least addicted to lookingafter number one."</p><p>"It depends upon whom he regards as number one!" said Madame Merle.And she remained thoughtful a moment, her eyes bent on the floor.</p><p>"Am I not to see your happy niece?" she asked at last as she raised them.</p><p>"You may see her; but you'll not be struck with her being happy. Shehas looked as solemn, these three days, as a Cimabue Madonna!" And Mrs.Touchett rang for a servant.</p><p>Isabel came in shortly after the footman had been sent to call her;and Madame Merle thought, as she appeared, that Mrs. Touchett'scomparison had its force. The girl was pale and grave --an effect notmitigated by her deeper mourning; but the smile of her brightestmoments came into her face as she saw Madame Merle, who went forward,laid her hand on our heroine's shoulder and, after looking at her amoment, kissed her as if she were returning the kiss she had receivedfrom her at Gardencourt. This was the only allusion the visitor, in hergreat good taste, made for the present to her young friend'sinheritance.</p><p>Mrs. Touchett had no purpose of awaiting in London the sale of herhouse. After selecting from among its furniture the objects she wishedto transport to her other abode, she left the rest of its contents tobe disposed of by the auctioneer and took her departure for theContinent. She was of course accompanied on this journey by her niece,who now had plenty of leisure to measure and weigh and otherwise handlethe windfall on which Madame Merle had covertly congratulated her.Isabel thought very often of the fact of her accession of means,looking at it in a dozen different lights; but we shall not now attemptto follow her train of thought or to explain exactly why her newconsciousness was at first oppressive. This failure to rise toimmediate joy was indeed but brief; the girl presently made up her mindthat to be rich was a virtue because it was to be able to do, and thatto do could only be sweet. It was the graceful contrary of the stupidside of weakness--especially the feminine variety. To be weak was, fora delicate young person, rather graceful, but, after all, as Isabelsaid to herself, there was a larger grace than that. Just now, it istrue, there was not much to do--once she had sent off a cheque to Lilyand another to poor Edith; but she was thankful for the quiet monthswhich her mourning robes and her aunt's fresh widowhood compelled themto spend together. The acquisition of power made her serious; shescrutinised her power with a kind of tender ferocity, but was not eagerto exercise it. She began to do so during a stay of some weeks whichshe eventually made with her aunt in Paris, though in ways that willinevitably present themselves as trivial. They were the ways mostnaturally imposed in a city in which the shops are the admiration ofthe world, and that were prescribed unreservedly by the guidance ofMrs. Touchett, who took a rigidly practical view of the transformationof her niece from a poor girl to a rich one. "Now that you're a youngwoman of fortune you must know how to play the part--I mean to play itwell," she said to Isabel once for all; and she added that the girl'sfirst duty was to have everything handsome. "You don't know how to takecare of your things, but you must learn," she went on; this wasIsabel's second duty. Isabel submitted, but for the present herimagination was not kindled; she longed for opportunities, but thesewere not the opportunities she meant.</p><p>Mrs. Touchett rarely changed her plans, and, having intended beforeher husband's death to spend a part of the winter in Paris, saw noreason to deprive herself--still less to deprive her companion--of thisadvantage. Though they would live in great retirement she might stillpresent her niece, informally, to the little circle of her fellowcountrymen dwelling upon the skirts of the Champs Elysees. With many ofthese amiable colonists Mrs. Touchett was intimate; she shared theirexpatriation, their convictions, their pastimes, their ennui. Isabelsaw them arrive with a good deal of assiduity at her aunt's hotel, andpronounced on them with a trenchancy doubtless to be accounted for bythe temporary exaltation of her sense of human duty. She made up hermind that their lives were, though luxurious, inane, and incurred somedisfavour by expressing this view on bright Sunday afternoons, when theAmerican absentees were engaged in calling on each other. Though herlisteners passed for people kept exemplarily genial by their cooks anddressmakers, two or three of them thought her cleverness, which wasgenerally admitted, inferior to that of the new theatrical pieces. "Youall live here this way, but what does it lead to?" she was pleased toask. "It doesn't seem to lead to anything, and I should think you'd getvery tired of it."</p><p>Mrs. Touchett thought the question worthy of Henrietta Stackpole.The two ladies had found Henrietta in Paris, and Isabel constantly sawher; so that Mrs. Touchett had some reason for saying to herself thatif her niece were not clever enough to originate almost anything, shemight be suspected of having borrowed that style of remark from herjournalistic friend. The first occasion on which Isabel had spoken wasthat of a visit paid by the two ladies to Mrs. Luce, an old friend ofMrs. Touchett's and the only person in Paris she now went to see. Mrs.Luce had been living in Paris since the days of Louis Philippe; sheused to say jocosely that she was one of the generation of 1830--a jokeof which the point was not always taken. When it failed Mrs. Luce usedto explain--"Oh yes, I'm one of the romantics;" her French had neverbecome quite perfect. She was always at home on Sunday afternoons andsurrounded by sympathetic compatriots, usually the same. In fact shewas at home at all times, and reproduced with wondrous truth in herwell-cushioned little corner of the brilliant city, the domestic toneof her native Baltimore. This reduced Mr. Luce, her worthy husband, atall, lean, grizzled, well-brushed gentleman who wore a gold eye-glassand carried his hat a little too much on the back of his head, to mereplatonic praise of the "distractions" of Paris --they were his greatword--since you would never have guessed from what cares he escaped tothem. One of them was that he went every day to the American banker's,where he found a post-office that was almost as sociable and colloquialan institution as in an American country town. He passed an hour (infine weather) in a chair in the Champs Elysees, and he dined uncommonlywell at his own table, seated above a waxed floor which it was Mrs.Luce's happiness to believe had a finer polish than any other in theFrench capital. Occasionally he dined with a friend or two at the CafeAnglais, where his talent for ordering a dinner was a source offelicity to his companions and an object of admiration even to theheadwaiter of the establishment. These were his only known pastimes,but they had beguiled his hours for upwards of half a century, and theydoubtless justified his frequent declaration that there was no placelike Paris. In no other place, on these terms, could Mr. Luce flatterhimself that he was enjoying life. There was nothing like Paris, but itmust be confessed that Mr. Luce thought less highly of this scene ofhis dissipations than in earlier days. In the list of his resources hispolitical reflections should not be omitted, for they were doubtlessthe animating principle of many hours that superficially seemed vacant.Like many of his fellow colonists Mr. Luce was a high--or rather adeep--conservative, and gave no countenance to the government latelyestablished in France. He had no faith in its duration and would assureyou from year to year that its end was close at hand. "They want to bekept down, sir, to be kept down; nothing but the strong hand--the ironheel--will do for them," he would frequently say of the French people;and his ideal of a fine showy clever rule was that of the supersededEmpire. "Paris is much less attractive than in the days of the Emperor;HE knew how to make a city pleasant," Mr. Luce had often remarked toMrs. Touchett, who was quite of his own way of thinking and wished toknow what one had crossed that odious Atlantic for but to get away fromrepublics.</p><p>"Why, madam, sitting in the Champs Elysees, opposite to the Palaceof Industry, I've seen the court-carriages from the Tuileries pass upand down as many as seven times a day. I remember one occasion whenthey went as high as nine. What do you see now? It's no use talking,the style's all gone. Napoleon knew what the French people want, andthere'll be a dark cloud over Paris, our Paris, till they get theEmpire back again."</p><p>Among Mrs. Luce's visitors on Sunday afternoons was a young man withwhom Isabel had had a good deal of conversation and whom she found fullof valuable knowledge. Mr. Edward Rosier--Ned Rosier as he wascalled--was native to New York and had been brought up in Paris, livingthere under the eye of his father who, as it happened, had been anearly and intimate friend of the late Mr. Archer. Edward Rosierremembered Isabel as a little girl; it had been his father who came tothe rescue of the small Archers at the inn at Neufchatel (he wastravelling that way with the boy and had stopped at the hotel bychance), after their bonne had gone off with the Russian prince andwhen Mr. Archer's whereabouts remained for some days a mystery. Isabelremembered perfectly the neat little male child whose hair smelt of adelicious cosmetic and who had a bonne all his own, warranted to losesight of him under no provocation. Isabel took a walk with the pairbeside the lake and thought little Edward as pretty as an angel--acomparison by no means conventional in her mind, for she had a verydefinite conception of a type of features which she supposed to beangelic and which her new friend perfectly illustrated. A small pinkface surmounted by a blue velvet bonnet and set off by a stiffembroidered collar had become the countenance of her childish dreams;and she had firmly believed for some time afterwards that the heavenlyhosts conversed among themselves in a queer little dialect ofFrench-English, expressing the properest sentiments, as when Edwardtold her that he was "defended" by his bonne to go near the edge of thelake, and that one must always obey to one's bonne. Ned Rosier'sEnglish had improved; at least it exhibited in a less degree the Frenchvariation. His father was dead and his bonne dismissed, but the youngman still conformed to the spirit of their teaching --he never went tothe edge of the lake. There was still something agreeable to thenostrils about him and something not offensive to nobler organs. He wasa very gentle and gracious youth, with what are called cultivatedtastes--an acquaintance with old china, with good wine, with thebindings of books, with the Almanach de Gotha, with the best shops, thebest hotels, the hours of railway-trains. He could order a dinneralmost as well as Mr. Luce, and it was probable that as his experienceaccumulated he would be a worthy successor to that gentleman, whoserather grim politics he also advocated in a soft and innocent voice. Hehad some charming rooms in Paris, decorated with old Spanishaltar-lace, the envy of his female friends, who declared that hischimney-piece was better draped than the high shoulders of many aduchess. He usually, however, spent a part of every winter at Pau, andhad once passed a couple of months in the United States.</p><p>He took a great interest in Isabel and remembered perfectly the walkat Neufchatel, when she would persist in going so near the edge. Heseemed to recognise this same tendency in the subversive enquiry that Iquoted a moment ago, and set himself to answer our heroine's questionwith greater urbanity than it perhaps deserved. "What does it lead to,Miss Archer? Why Paris leads everywhere. You can't go anywhere unlessyou come here first. Every one that comes to Europe has got to passthrough. You don't mean it in that sense so much? You mean what good itdoes you? Well, how can you penetrate futurity? How can you tell whatlies ahead? If it's a pleasant road I don't care where it leads. I likethe road, Miss Archer; I like the dear old asphalte. You can't gettired of it--you can't if you try. You think you would, but youwouldn't; there's always something new and fresh. Take the HotelDrouot, now; they sometimes have three and four sales a week. Where canyou get such things as you can here? In spite of all they say Imaintain they're cheaper too, if you know the right places. I knowplenty of places, but I keep them to myself. I'll tell you, if youlike, as a particular favour; only you mustn't tell any one else. Don'tyou go anywhere without asking me first; I want you to promise me that.As a general thing avoid the Boulevards; there's very little to be doneon the Boulevards. Speaking conscientiously--sans blague--I don'tbelieve any one knows Paris better than I. You and Mrs. Touchett mustcome and breakfast with me some day, and I'll show you my things; je nevous dis que ca! There has been a great deal of talk about London oflate; it's the fashion to cry up London. But there's nothing in it--youcan't do anything in London. No Louis Quinze--nothing of the FirstEmpire; nothing but their eternal Queen Anne. It's good for one'sbed-room, Queen Anne--for one's washing-room; but it isn't proper for asalon. Do I spend my life at the auctioneer's?" Mr. Rosier pursued inanswer to another question of Isabel's. "Oh no; I haven't the means. Iwish I had. You think I'm a mere trifler; I can tell by the expressionof your face--you've got a wonderfully expressive face. I hope youdon't mind my saying that; I mean it as a kind of warning. You think Iought to do something, and so do I, so long as you leave it vague. Butwhen you come to the point you see you have to stop. I can't go homeand be a shopkeeper. You think I'm very well fitted? Ah, Miss Archer,you overrate me. I can buy very well, but I can't sell; you should seewhen I sometimes try to get rid of my things. It takes much moreability to make other people buy than to buy yourself. When I think howclever they must be, the people who make ME buy! Ah no; I couldn't be ashopkeeper. I can't be a doctor; it's a repulsive business. I can't bea clergyman; I haven't got convictions. And then I can't pronounce thenames right in the Bible. They're very difficult, in the Old Testamentparticularly. I can't be a lawyer; I don't understand--how do you callit?--the American procedure. Is there anything else? There's nothingfor a gentleman in America. I should like to be a diplomatist; butAmerican diplomacy--that's not for gentlemen either. I'm sure if youhad seen the last min--"</p><p>Henrietta Stackpole, who was often with her friend when Mr. Rosier,coming to pay his compliments late in the afternoon, expressed himselfafter the fashion I have sketched, usually interrupted the young man atthis point and read him a lecture on the duties of the Americancitizen. She thought him most unnatural; he was worse than poor RalphTouchett. Henrietta, however, was at this time more than ever addictedto fine criticism, for her conscience had been freshly alarmed asregards Isabel. She had not congratulated this young lady on heraugmentations and begged to be excused from doing so.</p><p>"If Mr. Touchett had consulted me about leaving you the money," she frankly asserted, "I'd have said to him 'Never!"</p><p>"I see," Isabel had answered. "You think it will prove a curse in disguise. Perhaps it will."</p><p>"Leave it to some one you care less for--that's what I should have said."</p><p>"To yourself for instance?" Isabel suggested jocosely. And then, "Doyou really believe it will ruin me?" she asked in quite another tone.</p><p>"I hope it won't ruin you; but it will certainly confirm your dangerous tendencies."</p><p>"Do you mean the love of luxury--of extravagance?"</p><p>"No, no," said Henrietta; "I mean your exposure on the moral side. Iapprove of luxury; I think we ought to be as elegant as possible. Lookat the luxury of our western cities; I've seen nothing over here tocompare with it. I hope you'll never become grossly sensual; but I'mnot afraid of that. The peril for you is that you live too much in theworld of your own dreams. You're not enough in contact withreality--with the toiling, striving, suffering, I may even say sinning,world that surrounds you. You're too fastidious; you've too manygraceful illusions. Your newly-acquired thousands will shut you up moreand more to the society of a few selfish and heartless people who willbe interested in keeping them up."</p><p>Isabel's eyes expanded as she gazed at this lurid scene. "What are my illusions?" she asked. "I try so hard not to have any."</p><p>"Well," said Henrietta, "you think you can lead a romantic life,that you can live by pleasing yourself and pleasing others. You'll findyou're mistaken. Whatever life you lead you must put your soul init--to make any sort of success of it; and from the moment you do thatit ceases to be romance, I assure you: it becomes grim reality! And youcan't always please yourself; you must sometimes please other people.That, I admit, you're very ready to do; but there's another thingthat's still more important--you must often displease others. You mustalways be ready for that--you must never shrink from it. That doesn'tsuit you at all--you're too fond of admiration, you like to be thoughtwell of. You think we can escape disagreeable duties by taking romanticviews--that's your great illusion, my dear. But we can't. You must beprepared on many occasions in life to please no one at all--not evenyourself."</p><p>Isabel shook her head sadly; she looked troubled and frightened."This, for you, Henrietta," she said, "must be one of those occasions!"</p><p>It was certainly true that Miss Stackpole, during her visit toParis, which had been professionally more remunerative than her Englishsojourn, had not been living in the world of dreams. Mr. Bantling, whohad now returned to England, was her companion for the first four weeksof her stay; and about Mr. Bantling there was nothing dreamy. Isabellearned from her friend that the two had led a life of great personalintimacy and that this had been a peculiar advantage to Henrietta,owing to the gentleman's remarkable knowledge of Paris. He hadexplained everything, shown her everything, been her constant guide andinterpreter. They had breakfasted together, dined together, gone to thetheatre together, supped together, really in a manner quite livedtogether. He was a true friend, Henrietta more than once assured ourheroine; and she had never supposed that she could like any Englishmanso well. Isabel could not have told you why, but she found somethingthat ministered to mirth in the alliance the correspondent of theInterviewer had struck with Lady Pensil's brother; her amusementmoreover subsisted in face of the fact that she thought it a credit toeach of them. Isabel couldn't rid herself of a suspicion that they wereplaying somehow at cross-purposes--that the simplicity of each had beenentrapped. But this simplicity was on either side none the lesshonourable. It was as graceful on Henrietta's part to believe that Mr.Bantling took an interest in the diffusion of lively journalism and inconsolidating the position of lady-correspondents as it was on the partof his companion to suppose that the cause of the Interviewer--aperiodical of which he never formed a very definite conception--was, ifsubtly analysed (a task to which Mr. Bantling felt himself quiteequal), but the cause of Miss Stackpole's need of demonstrativeaffection. Each of these groping celibates supplied at any rate a wantof which the other was impatiently conscious. Mr. Bantling, who was ofrather a slow and a discursive habit, relished a prompt, keen, positivewoman, who charmed him by the influence of a shining, challenging eyeand a kind of bandbox freshness, and who kindled a perception ofraciness in a mind to which the usual fare of life seemed unsalted.Henrietta, on the other hand, enjoyed the society of a gentleman whoappeared somehow, in his way, made, by expensive, roundabout, almost"quaint" processes, for her use, and whose leisured state, thoughgenerally indefensible, was a decided boon to a breathless mate, andwho was furnished with an easy, traditional, though by no meansexhaustive, answer to almost any social or practical question thatcould come up. She often found Mr. Bantling's answers very convenient,and in the press of catching the American post would largely andshowily address them to publicity. It was to be feared that she wasindeed drifting toward those abysses of sophistication as to whichIsabel, wishing for a good-humoured retort, had warned her. There mightbe danger in store for Isabel; but it was scarcely to be hoped thatMiss Stackpole, on her side, would find permanent rest in any adoptionof the views of a class pledged to all the old abuses. Isabel continuedto warn her good-humouredly; Lady Pensil's obliging brother wassometimes, on our heroine's lips, an object of irreverent and facetiousallusion. Nothing, however, could exceed Henrietta's amiability on thispoint; she used to abound in the sense of Isabel's irony and toenumerate with elation the hours she had spent with this perfect man ofthe world--a term that had ceased to make with her, as previously, foropprobrium. Then, a few moments later, she would forget that they hadbeen talking jocosely and would mention with impulsive earnestness someexpedition she had enjoyed in his company. She would say: "Oh, I knowall about Versailles; I went there with Mr. Bantling. I was bound tosee it thoroughly--I warned him when we went out there that I wasthorough: so we spent three days at the hotel and wandered all over theplace. It was lovely weather --a kind of Indian summer, only not sogood. We just lived in that park. Oh yes; you can't tell me anythingabout Versailles." Henrietta appeared to have made arrangements to meether gallant friend during the spring in Italy.</p></span><span id = 970 ><p>Mrs. Touchett, before arriving in Paris, had fixed the day for herdeparture and by the middle of February had begun to travel southward.She interrupted her journey to pay a visit to her son, who at San Remo,on the Italian shore of the Mediterranean, had been spending a dull,bright winter beneath a slow-moving white umbrella. Isabel went withher aunt as a matter of course, though Mrs. Touchett, with homely,customary logic, had laid before her a pair of alternatives.</p><p>"Now, of course, you're completely your own mistress and are as freeas the bird on the bough. I don't mean you were not so before, butyou're at present on a different footing--property erects a kind ofbarrier. You can do a great many things if you're rich which would beseverely criticised if you were poor. You can go and come, you cantravel alone, you can have your own establishment: I mean of course ifyou'll take a companion--some decayed gentlewoman, with a darnedcashmere and dyed hair, who paints on velvet. You don't think you'dlike that? Of course you can do as you please; I only want you tounderstand how much you're at liberty. You might take Miss Stackpole asyour dame de compagnie; she'd keep people off very well. I think,however, that it's a great deal better you should remain with me, inspite of there being no obligation. It's better for several reasons,quite apart from your liking it. I shouldn't think you'd like it, but Irecommend you to make the sacrifice. Of course whatever novelty theremay have been at first in my society has quite passed away, and you seeme as I am--a dull, obstinate, narrow-minded old woman."</p><p>"I don't think you're at all dull," Isabel had replied to this.</p><p>"But you do think I'm obstinate and narrow-minded? I told you so!" said Mrs. Touchett with much elation at being justified.</p><p>Isabel remained for the present with her aunt, because, in spite ofeccentric impulses, she had a great regard for what was usually deemeddecent, and a young gentlewoman without visible relations had alwaysstruck her as a flower without foliage. It was true that Mrs.Touchett's conversation had never again appeared so brilliant as thatfirst afternoon in Albany, when she sat in her damp waterproof andsketched the opportunities that Europe would offer to a young person oftaste. This, however, was in a great measure the girl's own fault; shehad got a glimpse of her aunt's experience, and her imaginationconstantly anticipated the judgements and emotions of a woman who hadvery little of the same faculty. Apart from this, Mrs. Touchett had agreat merit; she was as honest as a pair of compasses. There was acomfort in her stiffness and firmness; you knew exactly where to findher and were never liable to chance encounters and concussions. On herown ground she was perfectly present, but was never over-inquisitive asregards the territory of her neighbour. Isabel came at last to have akind of undemonstrable pity for her; there seemed something so drearyin the condition of a person whose nature had, as it were, so littlesurface--offered so limited a face to the accretions of human contact.Nothing tender, nothing sympathetic, had ever had a chance to fastenupon it--no wind-sown blossom, no familiar softening moss. Her offered,her passive extent, in other words, was about that of a knife-edge.Isabel had reason to believe none the less that as she advanced in lifeshe made more of those concessions to the sense of something obscurelydistinct from convenience--more of them than she independently exacted.She was learning to sacrifice consistency to considerations of thatinferior order for which the excuse must be found in the particularcase. It was not to the credit of her absolute rectitude that sheshould have gone the longest way round to Florence in order to spend afew weeks with her invalid son; since in former years it had been oneof her most definite convictions that when Ralph wished to see her hewas at liberty to remember that Palazzo Crescentini contained a largeapartment known as the quarter of the signorino.</p><p>"I want to ask you something," Isabel said to this young man the dayafter her arrival at San Remo--"something I've thought more than onceof asking you by letter, but that I've hesitated on the whole to writeabout. Face to face, nevertheless, my question seems easy enough. Didyou know your father intended to leave me so much money?"</p><p>Ralph stretched his legs a little further than usual and gazed a little more fixedly at the Mediterranean.</p><p>"What does it matter, my dear Isabel, whether I knew? My father was very obstinate."</p><p>"So," said the girl, "you did know."</p><p>"Yes; he told me. We even talked it over a little." "What did he doit for?" asked Isabel abruptly. "Why, as a kind of compliment."</p><p>"A compliment on what?"</p><p>"On your so beautifully existing."</p><p>"He liked me too much," she presently declared.</p><p>"That's a way we all have."</p><p>"If I believed that I should be very unhappy. Fortunately I don'tbelieve it. I want to be treated with justice; I want nothing but that."</p><p>"Very good. But you must remember that justice to a lovely being is after all a florid sort of sentiment."</p><p>"I'm not a lovely being. How can you say that, at the very momentwhen I'm asking such odious questions? I must seem to you delicate!"</p><p>"You seem to me troubled," said Ralph.</p><p>"I am troubled."</p><p>"About what?"</p><p>For a moment she answered nothing; then she broke out: "Do you thinkit good for me suddenly to be made so rich? Henrietta doesn't."</p><p>"Oh, hang Henrietta!" said Ralph coarsely, "If you ask me I'm delighted at it."</p><p>"Is that why your father did it--for your amusement?"</p><p>"I differ with Miss Stackpole," Ralph went on more gravely. "I think it very good for you to have means."</p><p>Isabel looked at him with serious eyes. "I wonder whether you know what's good for me--or whether you care."</p><p>"If I know depend upon it I care. Shall I tell you what it is? Not to torment yourself."</p><p>"Not to torment you, I suppose you mean."</p><p>"You can't do that; I'm proof. Take things more easily. Don't askyourself so much whether this or that is good for you. Don't questionyour conscience so much--it will get out of tune like a strummed piano.Keep it for great occasions. Don't try so much to form yourcharacter--it's like trying to pull open a tight, tender young rose.Live as you like best, and your character will take care of itself.Most things are good for you; the exceptions are very rare, and acomfortable income's not one of them." Ralph paused, smiling; Isabelhad listened quickly. "You've too much power of thought--above all toomuch conscience," Ralph added. "It's out of all reason, the number ofthings you think wrong. Put back your watch. Diet your fever. Spreadyour wings; rise above the ground. It's never wrong to do that."</p><p>She had listened eagerly, as I say; and it was her nature tounderstand quickly. "I wonder if you appreciate what you say. If youdo, you take a great responsibility."</p><p>"You frighten me a little, but I think I'm right," said Ralph, persisting in cheer.</p><p>"All the same what you say is very true," Isabel pursued. "You couldsay nothing more true. I'm absorbed in myself--I look at life too muchas a doctor's prescription. Why indeed should we perpetually bethinking whether things are good for us, as if we were patients lyingin a hospital? Why should I be so afraid of not doing right? As if itmattered to the world whether I do right or wrong!"</p><p>"You're a capital person to advise," said Ralph; "you take the wind out of my sails!"</p><p>She looked at him as if she had not heard him--though she wasfollowing out the train of reflexion which he himself had kindled. "Itry to care more about the world than about myself--but I always comeback to myself. It's because I'm afraid." She stopped; her voice hadtrembled a little. "Yes, I'm afraid; I can't tell you. A large fortunemeans freedom, and I'm afraid of that. It's such a fine thing, and oneshould make such a good use of it. If one shouldn't one would beashamed. And one must keep thinking; it's a constant effort. I'm notsure it's not a greater happiness to be powerless."</p><p>"For weak people I've no doubt it's a greater happiness. For weak people the effort not to be contemptible must be great."</p><p>"And how do you know I'm not weak?" Isabel asked.</p><p>"Ah," Ralph answered with a flush that the girl noticed, "if you are I'm awfully sold!"</p><p>The charm of the Mediterranean coast only deepened for our heroineon acquaintance, for it was the threshold of Italy, the gate ofadmirations. Italy, as yet imperfectly seen and felt, stretched beforeher as a land of promise, a land in which a love of the beautiful mightbe comforted by endless knowledge. Whenever she strolled upon the shorewith her cousin--and she was the companion of his daily walk--shelooked across the sea, with longing eyes, to where she knew that Genoalay. She was glad to pause, however, on the edge of this largeradventure; there was such a thrill even in the preliminary hovering. Itaffected her moreover as a peaceful interlude, as a hush of the drumand fife in a career which she had little warrant as yet for regardingas agitated, but which nevertheless she was constantly picturing toherself by the light of her hopes, her fears, her fancies, herambitions, her predilections, and which reflected these subjectiveaccidents in a manner sufficiently dramatic. Madame Merle had predictedto Mrs. Touchett that after their young friend had put her hand intoher pocket half a dozen times she would be reconciled to the idea thatit had been filled by a munificent uncle; and the event justified, asit had so often justified before, that lady's perspicacity. RalphTouchett had praised his cousin for being morally inflammable, that isfor being quick to take a hint that was meant as good advice. Hisadvice had perhaps helped the matter; she had at any rate beforeleaving San Remo grown used to feeling rich. The consciousness inquestion found a proper place in rather a dense little group of ideasthat she had about herself, and often it was by no means the leastagreeable. It took perpetually for granted a thousand good intentions.She lost herself in a maze of visions; the fine things to be done by arich, independent, generous girl who took a large human view ofoccasions and obligations were sublime in the mass. Her fortunetherefore became to her mind a part of her better self; it gave herimportance, gave her even, to her own imagination, a certain idealbeauty. What it did for her in the imagination of others is anotheraffair, and on this point we must also touch in time. The visions Ihave just spoken of were mixed with other debates. Isabel liked betterto think of the future than of the past; but at times, as she listenedto the murmur of the Mediterranean waves, her glance took a backwardflight. It rested upon two figures which, in spite of increasingdistance, were still sufficiently salient; they were recognisablewithout difficulty as those of Caspar Goodwood and Lord Warburton. Itwas strange how quickly these images of energy had fallen into thebackground of our young lady's life. It was in her disposition at alltimes to lose faith in the reality of absent things; she could summonback her faith, in case of need, with an effort, but the effort wasoften painful even when the reality had been pleasant. The past was aptto look dead and its revival rather to show the livid light of ajudgement-day. The girl moreover was not prone to take for granted thatshe herself lived in the mind of others--she had not the fatuity tobelieve she left indelible traces. She was capable of being wounded bythe discovery that she had been forgotten; but of all liberties the oneshe herself found sweetest was the liberty to forget. She had not givenher last shilling, sentimentally speaking, either to Caspar Goodwood orto Lord Warburton, and yet couldn't but feel them appreciably in debtto her. She had of course reminded herself that she was to hear fromMr. Goodwood again; but this was not to be for another year and a half,and in that time a great many things might happen. She had indeedfailed to say to herself that her American suitor might find some othergirl more comfortable to woo; because, though it was certain many othergirls would prove so, she had not the smallest belief that this meritwould attract him. But she reflected that she herself might know thehumiliation of change, might really, for that matter, come to the endof the things that were not Caspar (even though there appeared so manyof them), and find rest in those very elements of his presence whichstruck her now as impediments to the finer respiration. It wasconceivable that these impediments should some day prove a sort ofblessing in disguise--a clear and quiet harbour enclosed by a bravegranite breakwater. But that day could only come in its order, and shecouldn't wait for it with folded hands. That Lord Warburton shouldcontinue to cherish her image seemed to her more than a noble humilityor an enlightened pride ought to wish to reckon with. She had sodefinitely undertaken to preserve no record of what had passed betweenthem that a corresponding effort on his own part would be eminentlyjust. This was not, as it may seem, merely a theory tinged withsarcasm. Isabel candidly believed that his lordship would, in the usualphrase, get over his disappointment. He had been deeply affected--thisshe believed, and she was still capable of deriving pleasure from thebelief; but it was absurd that a man both so intelligent and sohonourably dealt with should cultivate a scar out of proportion to anywound. Englishmen liked moreover to be comfortable, said Isabel, andthere could be little comfort for Lord Warburton, in the long run, inbrooding over a self-sufficient American girl who had been but a casualacquaintance. She flattered herself that, should she hear from one dayto another that he had married some young woman of his own country whohad done more to deserve him, she should receive the news without apang even of surprise. It would have proved that he believed she wasfirm--which was what she wished to seem to him. That alone was gratefulto her pride.</p></span><span id = 971 ><p>On one of the first days of May, some six months after old Mr.Touchett's death, a small group that might have been described by apainter as composing well was gathered in one of the many rooms of anancient villa crowning an olive-muffled hill outside of the Roman gateof Florence. The villa was a long, rather blank-looking structure, withthe far-projecting roof which Tuscany loves and which, on the hillsthat encircle Florence, when considered from a distance, makes soharmonious a rectangle with the straight, dark, definite cypresses thatusually rise in groups of three or four beside it. The house had afront upon a little grassy, empty, rural piazza which occupied a partof the hill-top; and this front, pierced with a few windows inirregular relations and furnished with a stone bench lengthily adjustedto the base of the structure and useful as a lounging-place to one ortwo persons wearing more or less of that air of undervalued merit whichin Italy, for some reason or other, always gracefully invests any onewho confidently assumes a perfectly passive attitude--this antique,solid, weather-worn, yet imposing front had a somewhat incommunicativecharacter. It was the mask, not the face of the house. It had heavylids, but no eyes; the house in reality looked another way--looked offbehind, into splendid openness and the range of the afternoon light. Inthat quarter the villa overhung the slope of its hill and the longvalley of the Arno, hazy with Italian colour. It had a narrow garden,in the manner of a terrace, productive chiefly of tangles of wild rosesand other old stone benches, mossy and sun-warmed. The parapet of theterrace was just the height to lean upon, and beneath it the grounddeclined into the vagueness of olive-crops and vineyards. It is not,however, with the outside of the place that we are concerned; on thisbright morning of ripened spring its tenants had reason to prefer theshady side of the wall. The windows of the ground-floor, as you sawthem from the piazza, were, in their noble proportions, extremelyarchitectural; but their function seemed less to offer communicationwith the world than to defy the world to look in. They were massivelycross-barred, and placed at such a height that curiosity, even ontiptoe, expired before it reached them. In an apartment lighted by arow of three of these jealous apertures--one of the several distinctapartments into which the villa was divided and which were mainlyoccupied by foreigners of random race long resident in Florence--agentleman was seated in company with a young girl and two good sistersfrom a religious house. The room was, however, less sombre than ourindications may have represented, for it had a wide, high door, whichnow stood open into the tangled garden behind; and the tall ironlattices admitted on occasion more than enough of the Italian sunshine.It was moreover a seat of ease, indeed of luxury, telling ofarrangements subtly studied and refinements frankly proclaimed, andcontaining a variety of those faded hangings of damask and tapestry,those chests and cabinets of carved and time-polished oak, thoseangular specimens of pictorial art in frames as pedantically primitive,those perverse-looking relics of medieval brass and pottery, of whichItaly has long been the not quite exhausted storehouse. These thingskept terms with articles of modern furniture in which large allowancehad been made for a lounging generation; it was to be noticed that allthe chairs were deep and well padded and that much space was occupiedby a writing-table of which the ingenious perfection bore the stamp ofLondon and the nineteenth century. There were books in profusion andmagazines and newspapers, and a few small, odd, elaborate pictures,chiefly in water-colour. One of these productions stood on adrawing-room easel before which, at the moment we begin to be concernedwith her, the young girl I have mentioned had placed herself. She waslooking at the picture in silence.</p><p>Silence--absolute silence--had not fallen upon her companions; buttheir talk had an appearance of embarrassed continuity. The two goodsisters had not settled themselves in their respective chairs; theirattitude expressed a final reserve and their faces showed the glaze ofprudence. They were plain, ample, mild-featured women, with a kind ofbusiness-like modesty to which the impersonal aspect of their stiffenedlinen and of the serge that draped them as if nailed on frames gave anadvantage. One of them, a person of a certain age, in spectacles, witha fresh complexion and a full cheek, had a more discriminating mannerthan her colleague, as well as the responsibility of their errand,which apparently related to the young girl. This object of interestwore her hat--an ornament of extreme simplicity and not at variancewith her plain muslin gown, too short for her years, though it mustalready have been "let out." The gentleman who might have been supposedto be entertaining the two nuns was perhaps conscious of thedifficulties of his function, it being in its way as arduous toconverse with the very meek as with the very mighty. At the same timehe was clearly much occupied with their quiet charge, and while sheturned her back to him his eyes rested gravely on her slim, smallfigure. He was a man of forty, with a high but well-shaped head, onwhich the hair, still dense, but prematurely grizzled, had been croppedclose. He had a fine, narrow, extremely modelled and composed face, ofwhich the only fault was just this effect of its running a trifle toomuch to points; an appearance to which the shape of the beardcontributed not a little. This beard, cut in the manner of theportraits of the sixteenth century and surmounted by a fair moustache,of which the ends had a romantic upward flourish, gave its wearer aforeign, traditionary look and suggested that he was a gentleman whostudied style. His conscious, curious eyes, however, eyes at once vagueand penetrating, intelligent and hard, expressive of the observer aswell as of the dreamer, would have assured you that he studied it onlywithin well-chosen limits, and that in so far as he sought it he foundit. You would have been much at a loss to determine his original climeand country; he had none of the superficial signs that usually renderthe answer to this question an insipidly easy one. If he had Englishblood in his veins it had probably received some French or Italiancommixture; but he suggested, fine gold coin as he was, no stamp noremblem of the common mintage that provides for general circulation; hewas the elegant complicated medal struck off for a special occasion. Hehad a light, lean, rather languid-looking figure, and was apparentlyneither tall nor short. He was dressed as a man dresses who takeslittle other trouble about it than to have no vulgar things.</p><p>"Well, my dear, what do you think of it?" he asked of the younggirl. He used the Italian tongue, and used it with perfect ease; butthis would not have convinced you he was Italian.</p><p>The child turned her head earnestly to one side and the other. "It's very pretty, papa. Did you make it yourself?"</p><p>"Certainly I made it. Don't you think I'm clever?"</p><p>"Yes, papa, very clever; I also have learned to make pictures." Andshe turned round and showed a small, fair face painted with a fixed andintensely sweet smile.</p><p>"You should have brought me a specimen of your powers."</p><p>"I've brought a great many; they're in my trunk."</p><p>"She draws very--very carefully," the elder of the nuns remarked, speaking in French.</p><p>"I'm glad to hear it. Is it you who have instructed her?"</p><p>"Happily no," said the good sister, blushing a little. "Ce n'est pasma partie. I teach nothing; I leave that to those who are wiser. We'vean excellent drawing-master, Mr.--Mr.--what is his name?" she asked ofher companion.</p><p>Her companion looked about at the carpet. "It's a German name," she said in Italian, as if it needed to be translated.</p><p>"Yes," the other went on, "he's a German, and we've had him many years."</p><p>The young girl, who was not heeding the conversation, had wanderedaway to the open door of the large room and stood looking into thegarden. "And you, my sister, are French," said the gentleman.</p><p>"Yes, sir," the visitor gently replied. "I speak to the pupils in myown tongue. I know no other. But we have sisters of othercountries--English, German, Irish. They all speak their properlanguage."</p><p>The gentleman gave a smile. "Has my daughter been under the care ofone of the Irish ladies?" And then, as he saw that his visitorssuspected a joke, though failing to understand it, "You're verycomplete," he instantly added.</p><p>"Oh, yes, we're complete. We've everything, and everything's of the best."</p><p>"We have gymnastics," the Italian sister ventured to remark. "But not dangerous."</p><p>"I hope not. Is that YOUR branch?" A question which provoked muchcandid hilarity on the part of the two ladies; on the subsidence ofwhich their entertainer, glancing at his daughter, remarked that shehad grown.</p><p>"Yes, but I think she has finished. She'll remain--not big," said the French sister.</p><p>"I'm not sorry. I prefer women like books--very good and not toolong. But I know," the gentleman said, "no particular reason why mychild should be short."</p><p>The nun gave a temperate shrug, as if to intimate that such thingsmight be beyond our knowledge. "She's in very good health; that's thebest thing."</p><p>"Yes, she looks sound." And the young girl's father watched her a moment. "What do you see in the garden?" he asked in French.</p><p>"I see many flowers," she replied in a sweet, small voice and with an accent as good as his own.</p><p>"Yes, but not many good ones. However, such as they are, go out and gather some for ces dames."</p><p>The child turned to him with her smile heightened by pleasure. "May I, truly?"</p><p>"Ah, when I tell you," said her father.</p><p>The girl glanced at the elder of the nuns. "May I, truly, ma mere?"</p><p>"Obey monsieur your father, my child," said the sister, blushing again.</p><p>The child, satisfied with this authorisation, descended from thethreshold and was presently lost to sight. "You don't spoil them," saidher father gaily.</p><p>"For everything they must ask leave. That's our system. Leave is freely granted, but they must ask it."</p><p>"Oh, I don't quarrel with your system; I've no doubt it's excellent.I sent you my daughter to see what you'd make of her. I had faith."</p><p>"One must have faith," the sister blandly rejoined, gazing through her spectacles.</p><p>"Well, has my faith been rewarded What have you made of her?"</p><p>The sister dropped her eyes a moment. "A good Christian, monsieur."</p><p>Her host dropped his eyes as well; but it was probable that themovement had in each case a different spring. "Yes, and what else?"</p><p>He watched the lady from the convent, probably thinking she wouldsay that a good Christian was everything; but for all her simplicityshe was not so crude as that. "A charming young lady --a real littlewoman--a daughter in whom you will have nothing but contentment."</p><p>"She seems to me very gentille," said the father. "She's really pretty."</p><p>"She's perfect. She has no faults."</p><p>"She never had any as a child, and I'm glad you have given her none."</p><p>"We love her too much," said the spectacled sister with dignity.</p><p>"And as for faults, how can we give what we have not? Le couventn'est pas comme le monde, monsieur. She's our daughter, as you may say.We've had her since she was so small."</p><p>"Of all those we shall lose this year she's the one we shall miss most," the younger woman murmured deferentially.</p><p>"Ah, yes, we shall talk long of her," said the other. "We shall holdher up to the new ones." And at this the good sister appeared to findher spectacles dim; while her companion, after fumbling a moment,presently drew forth a pocket-handkerchief of durable texture.</p><p>"It's not certain you'll lose her; nothing's settled yet," theirhost rejoined quickly; not as if to anticipate their tears, but in thetone of a man saying what was most agreeable to himself. "We should bevery happy to believe that. Fifteen is very young to leave us."</p><p>"Oh," exclaimed the gentleman with more vivacity than he had yetused, "it is not I who wish to take her away. I wish you could keep heralways!"</p><p>"Ah, monsieur," said the elder sister, smiling and getting up, "good as she is, she's made for the world. Le monde y gagnera."</p><p>"If all the good people were hidden away in convents how would the world get on?" her companion softly enquired, rising also.</p><p>This was a question of a wider bearing than the good womanapparently supposed; and the lady in spectacles took a harmonising viewby saying comfortably: "Fortunately there are good people everywhere."</p><p>"If you're going there will be two less here," her host remarked gallantly.</p><p>For this extravagant sally his simple visitors had no answer, andthey simply looked at each other in decent deprecation; but theirconfusion was speedily covered by the return of the young girl with twolarge bunches of roses--one of them all white, the other red.</p><p>"I give you your choice, mamman Catherine," said the child. "It'sonly the colour that's different, mamman Justine; there are just asmany roses in one bunch as in the other."</p><p>The two sisters turned to each other, smiling and hesitating, with "Which will you take?" and "No, it's for you to choose."</p><p>"I'll take the red, thank you," said Catherine in the spectacles."I'm so red myself. They'll comfort us on our way back to Rome."</p><p>"Ah, they won't last," cried the young girl. I wish I could give you something that would last!"</p><p>"You've given us a good memory of yourself, my daughter. That will last!"</p><p>"I wish nuns could wear pretty things. I would give you my blue beads," the child went on.</p><p>"And do you go back to Rome to-night?" her father enquired.</p><p>"Yes, we take the train again. We've so much to do la-bas."</p><p>"Are you not tired?"</p><p>"We are never tired."</p><p>"Ah, my sister, sometimes," murmured the junior votaress.</p><p>"Not to-day, at any rate. We have rested too well here. Que Dieu vows garde, ma fine."</p><p>Their host, while they exchanged kisses with his daughter, wentforward to open the door through which they were to pass; but as he didso he gave a slight exclamation, and stood looking beyond. The dooropened into a vaulted ante-chamber, as high as a chapel and paved withred tiles; and into this antechamber a lady had just been admitted by aservant, a lad in shabby livery, who was now ushering her toward theapartment in which our friends were grouped. The gentleman at the door,after dropping his exclamation, remained silent; in silence too thelady advanced. He gave her no further audible greeting and offered herno hand, but stood aside to let her pass into the saloon. At thethreshold she hesitated. "Is there any one?" she asked.</p><p>"Some one you may see."</p><p>She went in and found herself confronted with the two nuns and theirpupil, who was coming forward, between them, with a hand in the arm ofeach. At the sight of the new visitor they all paused, and the lady,who had also stopped, stood looking at them. The young girl gave alittle soft cry: "Ah, Madame Merle!"</p><p>The visitor had been slightly startled, but her manner the nextinstant was none the less gracious. "Yes, it's Madame Merle, come towelcome you home." And she held out two hands to the girl, whoimmediately came up to her, presenting her forehead to be kissed.Madame Merle saluted this portion of her charming little person andthen stood smiling at the two nuns. They acknowledged her smile with adecent obeisance, but permitted themselves no direct scrutiny of thisimposing, brilliant woman, who seemed to bring in with her something ofthe radiance of the outer world. "These ladies have brought my daughterhome, and now they return to the convent," the gentleman explained.</p><p>"Ah, you go back to Rome? I've lately come from there. It's very lovely now," said Madame Merle.</p><p>The good sisters, standing with their hands folded into theirsleeves, accepted this statement uncritically; and the master of thehouse asked his new visitor how long it was since she had left Rome."She came to see me at the convent," said the young girl before thelady addressed had time to reply.</p><p>"I've been more than once, Pansy," Madame Merle declared. "Am I not your great friend in Rome?"</p><p>"I remember the last time best," said Pansy, "because you told me I should come away."</p><p>"Did you tell her that?" the child's father asked.</p><p>"I hardly remember. I told her what I thought would please her. I've been in Florence a week. I hoped you would come to see me."</p><p>"I should have done so if I had known you were there. One doesn'tknow such things by inspiration--though I suppose one ought. You hadbetter sit down."</p><p>These two speeches were made in a particular tone of voice--a tonehalf-lowered and carefully quiet, but as from habit rather than fromany definite need. Madame Merle looked about her, choosing her seat."You're going to the door with these women? Let me of course notinterrupt the ceremony. Je vous salue, mesdames," she added, in French,to the nuns, as if to dismiss them.</p><p>"This lady's a great friend of ours; you will have seen her at theconvent," said their entertainer. "We've much faith in her judgement,and she'll help me to decide whether my daughter shall return to you atthe end of the holidays."</p><p>"I hope you'll decide in our favour, madame," the sister in spectacles ventured to remark.</p><p>"That's Mr. Osmond's pleasantry; I decide nothing," said MadameMerle, but also as in pleasantry. "I believe you've a very good school,but Miss Osmond's friends must remember that she's very naturally meantfor the world."</p><p>"That's what I've told monsieur," sister Catherine answered. "It'sprecisely to fit her for the world," she murmured, glancing at Pansy,who stood, at a little distance, attentive to Madame Merle's elegantapparel.</p><p>"Do you hear that, Pansy? You're very naturally meant for the world," said Pansy's father.</p><p>The child fixed him an instant with her pure young eyes. "Am I not meant for you, papa?"</p><p>Papa gave a quick, light laugh. "That doesn't prevent it! I'm of the world, Pansy."</p><p>"Kindly permit us to retire," said sister Catherine. "Be good and wise and happy in any case, my daughter."</p><p>"I shall certainly come back and see you," Pansy returned,recommencing her embraces, which were presently interrupted by MadameMerle.</p><p>"Stay with me, dear child," she said, "while your father takes the good ladies to the door."</p><p>Pansy stared, disappointed, yet not protesting. She was evidentlyimpregnated with the idea of submission, which was due to any one whotook the tone of authority; and she was a passive spectator of theoperation of her fate. "May I not see mamman Catherine get into thecarriage?" she nevertheless asked very gently.</p><p>"It would please me better if you'd remain with me," said MadameMerle, while Mr. Osmond and his companions, who had bowed low again tothe other visitor, passed into the ante-chamber.</p><p>"Oh yes, I'll stay," Pansy answered; and she stood near MadameMerle, surrendering her little hand, which this lady took. She staredout of the window; her eyes had filled with tears.</p><p>"I'm glad they've taught you to obey," said Madame Merle. "That's what good little girls should do."</p><p>"Oh yes, I obey very well," cried Pansy with soft eagerness, almostwith boastfulness, as if she had been speaking of her piano-playing.And then she gave a faint, just audible sigh.</p><p>Madame Merle, holding her hand, drew it across her own fine palm andlooked at it. The gaze was critical, but it found nothing to deprecate;the child's small hand was delicate and fair. "I hope they always seethat you wear gloves," she said in a moment. "Little girls usuallydislike them."</p><p>"I used to dislike them, but I like them now," the child made answer.</p><p>"Very good, I'll make you a present of a dozen."</p><p>"I thank you very much. What colours will they be?" Pansy demanded with interest.</p><p>Madame Merle meditated. "Useful colours."</p><p>"But very pretty?"</p><p>"Are you very fond of pretty things?"</p><p>"Yes; but--but not too fond," said Pansy with a trace of asceticism.</p><p>"Well, they won't be too pretty," Madame Merle returned with alaugh. She took the child's other hand and drew her nearer; afterwhich, looking at her a moment, "Shall you miss mother Catherine?" shewent on.</p><p>"Yes--when I think of her."</p><p>"Try then not to think of her. Perhaps some day," added Madame Merle, "you'll have another mother."</p><p>"I don't think that's necessary," Pansy said, repeating her littlesoft conciliatory sigh. "I had more than thirty mothers at the convent."</p><p>Her father's step sounded again in the antechamber, and Madame Merlegot up, releasing the child. Mr. Osmond came in and closed the door;then, without looking at Madame Merle, he pushed one or two chairs backinto their places. His visitor waited a moment for him to speak,watching him as he moved about. Then at last she said: "I hoped you'dhave come to Rome. I thought it possible you'd have wished yourself tofetch Pansy away."</p><p>"That was a natural supposition; but I'm afraid it's not the first time I've acted in defiance of your calculations."</p><p>"Yes," said Madame Merle, "I think you very perverse."</p><p>Mr. Osmond busied himself for a moment in the room--there was plentyof space in it to move about--in the fashion of a man mechanicallyseeking pretexts for not giving an attention which may be embarrassing.Presently, however, he had exhausted his pretexts; there was nothingleft for him--unless he took up a book--but to stand with his handsbehind him looking at Pansy. "Why didn't you come and see the last ofmamman Catherine?" he asked of her abruptly in French.</p><p>Pansy hesitated a moment, glancing at Madame Merle. "I asked her tostay with me," said this lady, who had seated herself again in anotherplace.</p><p>"Ah, that was better," Osmond conceded. With which he dropped into achair and sat looking at Madame Merle; bent forward a little, hiselbows on the edge of the arms and his hands interlocked.</p><p>"She's going to give me some gloves," said Pansy.</p><p>"You needn't tell that to every one, my dear," Madame Merle observed.</p><p>"You're very kind to her," said Osmond. "She's supposed to have everything she needs."</p><p>"I should think she had had enough of the nuns."</p><p>"If we're going to discuss that matter she had better go out of the room."</p><p>"Let her stay," said Madame Merle. "We'll talk of something else."</p><p>"If you like I won't listen," Pansy suggested with an appearance of candour which imposed conviction.</p><p>"You may listen, charming child, because you won't understand," herfather replied. The child sat down, deferentially, near the open door,within sight of the garden, into which she directed her innocent,wistful eyes; and Mr. Osmond went on irrelevantly, addressing himselfto his other companion. "You're looking particularly well."</p><p>"I think I always look the same," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"You always ARE the same. You don't vary. You're a wonderful woman."</p><p>"Yes, I think I am."</p><p>"You sometimes change your mind, however. You told me on your returnfrom England that you wouldn't leave Rome again for the present."</p><p>"I'm pleased that you remember so well what I say. That was myintention. But I've come to Florence to meet some friends who havelately arrived and as to whose movements I was at that time uncertain."</p><p>"That reason's characteristic. You're always doing something for your friends."</p><p>Madame Merle smiled straight at her host. "It's less characteristicthan your comment upon it which is perfectly insincere. I don't,however, make a crime of that," she added, "because if you don'tbelieve what you say there's no reason why you should. I don't ruinmyself for my friends; I don't deserve your praise. I care greatly formyself."</p><p>"Exactly; but yourself includes so many other selves--so much ofevery one else and of everything. I never knew a person whose lifetouched so many other lives."</p><p>"What do you call one's life?" asked Madame Merle. "One's appearance, one's movements, one's engagements, one's society?"</p><p>"I call YOUR life your ambitions," said Osmond.</p><p>Madame Merle looked a moment at Pansy. "I wonder if she understands that," she murmured.</p><p>"You see she can't stay with us!" And Pansy's father gave rather ajoyless smile. "Go into the garden, mignonne, and pluck a flower or twofor Madame Merle," he went on in French.</p><p>"That's just what I wanted to do," Pansy exclaimed, rising withpromptness and noiselessly departing. Her father followed her to theopen door, stood a moment watching her, and then came back, butremained standing, or rather strolling to and fro, as if to cultivate asense of freedom which in another attitude might be wanting.</p><p>"My ambitions are principally for you," said Madame Merle, looking up at him with a certain courage.</p><p>"That comes back to what I say. I'm part of your life--I and athousand others. You're not selfish--I can't admit that. If you wereselfish, what should I be? What epithet would properly describe me?"</p><p>"You're indolent. For me that's your worst fault."</p><p>"I'm afraid it's really my best."</p><p>"You don't care," said Madame Merle gravely.</p><p>"No; I don't think I care much. What sort of a fault do you callthat? My indolence, at any rate, was one of the reasons I didn't go toRome. But it was only one of them."</p><p>"It's not of importance--to me at least--that you didn't go; thoughI should have been glad to see you. I'm glad you're not in Romenow--which you might be, would probably be, if you had gone there amonth ago. There's something I should like you to do at present inFlorence."</p><p>"Please remember my indolence," said Osmond.</p><p>"I do remember it; but I beg you to forget it. In that way you'llhave both the virtue and the reward. This is not a great labour, and itmay prove a real interest. How long is it since you made a newacquaintance?"</p><p>"I don't think I've made any since I made yours."</p><p>"It's time then you should make another. There's a friend of mine I want you to know."</p><p>Mr. Osmond, in his walk, had gone back to the open door again andwas looking at his daughter as she moved about in the intense sunshine."What good will it do me?" he asked with a sort of genial crudity.</p><p>Madame Merle waited. "It will amuse you." There was nothing crude in this rejoinder; it had been thoroughly well considered.</p><p>"If you say that, you know, I believe it," said Osmond, comingtoward her. "There are some points in which my confidence in you iscomplete. I'm perfectly aware, for instance, that you know good societyfrom bad."</p><p>"Society is all bad."</p><p>"Pardon me. That isn't--the knowledge I impute to you--a common sortof wisdom. You've gained it in the right way--experimentally; you'vecompared an immense number of more or less impossible people with eachother."</p><p>"Well, I invite you to profit by my knowledge."</p><p>"To profit? Are you very sure that I shall?"</p><p>"It's what I hope. It will depend on yourself. If I could only induce you to make an effort!"</p><p>"Ah, there you are! I knew something tiresome was coming. What in the world--that's likely to turn up here--is worth an effort?"</p><p>Madame Merle flushed as with a wounded intention. "Don't be foolish,Osmond. No one knows better than you what IS worth an effort. Haven't Iseen you in old days?"</p><p>"I recognise some things. But they're none of them probable in this poor life."</p><p>"It's the effort that makes them probable," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"There's something in that. Who then is your friend?"</p><p>"The person I came to Florence to see. She's a niece of Mrs. Touchett, whom you'll not have forgotten."</p><p>"A niece? The word niece suggests youth and ignorance. I see what you're coming to."</p><p>"Yes, she's young--twenty-three years old. She's a great friend ofmine. I met her for the first time in England, several months ago, andwe struck up a grand alliance. I like her immensely, and I do what Idon't do every day--I admire her. You'll do the same."</p><p>"Not if I can help it."</p><p>"Precisely. But you won't be able to help it."</p><p>"Is she beautiful, clever, rich, splendid, universally intelligentand unprecedentedly virtuous? It's only on those conditions that I careto make her acquaintance. You know I asked you some time ago never tospeak to me of a creature who shouldn't correspond to that description.I know plenty of dingy people; I don't want to know any more."</p><p>"Miss Archer isn't dingy; she's as bright as the morning. Shecorresponds to your description; it's for that I wish you to know her.She fills all your requirements."</p><p>"More or less, of course."</p><p>"No; quite literally. She's beautiful, accomplished, generous and,for an American, well-born. She's also very clever and very amiable,and she has a handsome fortune."</p><p>Mr. Osmond listened to this in silence, appearing to turn it over inhis mind with his eyes on his informant. "What do you want to do withher?" he asked at last.</p><p>"What you see. Put her in your way."</p><p>"Isn't she meant for something better than that?"</p><p>"I don't pretend to know what people are meant for," said Madame Merle. "I only know what I can do with them."</p><p>"I'm sorry for Miss Archer!" Osmond declared.</p><p>Madame Merle got up. "If that's a beginning of interest in her I take note of it."</p><p>The two stood there face to face; she settled her mantilla, lookingdown at it as she did so. "You're looking very well," Osmond repeatedstill less relevantly than before. "You have some idea. You're never sowell as when you've got an idea; they're always becoming to you."</p><p>In the manner and tone of these two persons, on first meeting at anyjuncture, and especially when they met in the presence of others, wassomething indirect and circumspect, as if they had approached eachother obliquely and addressed each other by implication. The effect ofeach appeared to be to intensify to an appreciable degree theself-consciousness of the other. Madame Merle of course carried off anyembarrassment better than her friend; but even Madame Merle had not onthis occasion the form she would have liked to have--the perfectself-possession she would have wished to wear for her host. The pointto be made is, however, that at a certain moment the element betweenthem, whatever it was, always levelled itself and left them moreclosely face to face than either ever was with any one else. This waswhat had happened now. They stood there knowing each other well andeach on the whole willing to accept the satisfaction of knowing as acompensation for the inconvenience--whatever it might be--of beingknown. "I wish very much you were not so heartless," Madame Merlequietly said. "It has always been against you, and it will be againstyou now."</p><p>"I'm not so heartless as you think. Every now and then somethingtouches me--as for instance your saying just now that your ambitionsare for me. I don't understand it; I don't see how or why they shouldbe. But it touches me, all the same."</p><p>"You'll probably understand it even less as time goes on. There aresome things you'll never understand. There's no particular need youshould."</p><p>"You, after all, are the most remarkable of women," said Osmond."You have more in you than almost any one. I don't see why you thinkMrs. Touchett's niece should matter very much to me, when-- when--" Buthe paused a moment.</p><p>"When I myself have mattered so little?"</p><p>"That of course is not what I meant to say. When I've known and appreciated such a woman as you."</p><p>"Isabel Archer's better than I," said Madame Merle.</p><p>Her companion gave a laugh. "How little you must think of her to say that!"</p><p>"Do you suppose I'm capable of jealousy? Please answer me that."</p><p>"With regard to me? No; on the whole I don't."</p><p>"Come and see me then, two days hence. I'm staying at Mrs. Touchett's--Palazzo Crescentini--and the girl will be there."</p><p>"Why didn't you ask me that at first simply, without speaking of thegirl?" said Osmond. "You could have had her there at any rate."</p><p>Madame Merle looked at him in the manner of a woman whom no questionhe could ever put would find unprepared. "Do you wish to know why?Because I've spoken of you to her."</p><p>Osmond frowned and turned away. "I'd rather not know that." Then ina moment he pointed out the easel supporting the little water-colourdrawing. "Have you seen what's there--my last?"</p><p>Madame Merle drew near and considered. "Is it the Venetian Alps--one of your last year's sketches?"</p><p>"Yes--but how you guess everything!"</p><p>She looked a moment longer, then turned away. "You know I don't care for your drawings."</p><p>"I know it, yet I'm always surprised at it. They're really so much better than most people's."</p><p>"That may very well be. But as the only thing you do--well, it's solittle. I should have liked you to do so many other things: those weremy ambitions."</p><p>"Yes; you've told me many times--things that were impossible."</p><p>"Things that were impossible," said Madame Merle. And then in quitea different tone: "In itself your little picture's very good." Shelooked about the room--at the old cabinets, pictures, tapestries,surfaces of faded silk. "Your rooms at least are perfect. I'm struckwith that afresh whenever I come back; I know none better anywhere. Youunderstand this sort of thing as nobody anywhere does. You've suchadorable taste."</p><p>"I'm sick of my adorable taste," said Gilbert Osmond.</p><p>"You must nevertheless let Miss Archer come and see it. I've told her about it."</p><p>"I don't object to showing my things--when people are not idiots."</p><p>"You do it delightfully. As cicerone of your museum you appear to particular advantage."</p><p>Mr. Osmond, in return for this compliment, simply looked at once colder and more attentive. "Did you say she was rich?"</p><p>"She has seventy thousand pounds."</p><p>"En ecus bien comptes?"</p><p>"There's no doubt whatever about her fortune. I've seen it, as I may say."</p><p>"Satisfactory woman!--I mean you. And if I go to see her shall I see the mother?"</p><p>"The mother? She has none--nor father either."</p><p>"The aunt then--whom did you say?--Mrs. Touchett. I can easily keep her out of the way."</p><p>"I don't object to her," said Osmond; "I rather like Mrs. Touchett.She has a sort of old-fashioned character that's passing away--a vivididentity. But that long jackanapes the son--is he about the place?"</p><p>"He's there, but he won't trouble you."</p><p>"He's a good deal of a donkey."</p><p>"I think you're mistaken. He's a very clever man. But he's not fond of being about when I'm there, because he doesn't like me."</p><p>"What could he be more asinine than that? Did you say she has looks?" Osmond went on.</p><p>"Yes; but I won't say it again, lest you should be disappointed in them. Come and make a beginning; that's all I ask of you."</p><p>"A beginning of what?"</p><p>Madame Merle was silent a little. "I want you of course to marry her."</p><p>"The beginning of the end? Well, I'll see for myself. Have you told her that?"</p><p>"For what do you take me? She's not so coarse a piece of machinery--nor am I."</p><p>"Really," said Osmond after some meditation, "I don't understand your ambitions."</p><p>"I think you'll understand this one after you've seen Miss Archer.Suspend your judgement." Madame Merle, as she spoke, had drawn near theopen door of the garden, where she stood a moment looking out. "Pansyhas really grown pretty," she presently added.</p><p>"So it seemed to me."</p><p>"But she has had enough of the convent."</p><p>"I don't know," said Osmond. "I like what they've made of her. It's very charming."</p><p>"That's not the convent. It's the child's nature."</p><p>"It's the combination, I think. She's as pure as a pearl."</p><p>"Why doesn't she come back with my flowers then?" Madame Merle asked. "She's not in a hurry."</p><p>"We'll go and get them."</p><p>"She doesn't like me," the visitor murmured as she raised her parasol and they passed into the garden.</p></span><span id = 972 ><p>Madame Merle, who had come to Florence on Mrs. Touchett's arrival atthe invitation of this lady--Mrs. Touchett offering her for a month thehospitality of Palazzo Crescentini--the judicious Madame Merle spoke toIsabel afresh about Gilbert Osmond and expressed the hope she mightknow him; making, however, no such point of the matter as we have seenher do in recommending the girl herself to Mr. Osmond's attention. Thereason of this was perhaps that Isabel offered no resistance whateverto Madame Merle's proposal. In Italy, as in England, the lady had amultitude of friends, both among the natives of the country and itsheterogeneous visitors. She had mentioned to Isabel most of the peoplethe girl would find it well to "meet"--of course, she said, Isabelcould know whomever in the wide world she would--and had placed Mr.Osmond near the top of the list. He was an old friend of her own; shehad known him these dozen years; he was one of the cleverest and mostagreeable men--well, in Europe simply. He was altogether above therespectable average; quite another affair. He wasn't a professionalcharmer--far from it, and the effect he produced depended a good dealon the state of his nerves and his spirits. When not in the right moodhe could fall as low as any one, saved only by his looking at suchhours rather like a demoralised prince in exile. But if he cared or wasinterested or rightly challenged--just exactly rightly it had tobe--then one felt his cleverness and his distinction. Those qualitiesdidn't depend, in him, as in so many people, on his not committing orexposing himself. He had his perversities--which indeed Isabel wouldfind to be the case with all the men really worth knowing--and didn'tcause his light to shine equally for all persons. Madame Merle,however, thought she could undertake that for Isabel he would bebrilliant. He was easily bored, too easily, and dull people always puthim out; but a quick and cultivated girl like Isabel would give him astimulus which was too absent from his life. At any rate he was aperson not to miss. One shouldn't attempt to live in Italy withoutmaking a friend of Gilbert Osmond, who knew more about the country thanany one except two or three German professors. And if they had moreknowledge than he it was he who had most perception and taste-- beingartistic through and through. Isabel remembered that her friend hadspoken of him during their plunge, at Gardencourt, into the deeps oftalk, and wondered a little what was the nature of the tie bindingthese superior spirits. She felt that Madame Merle's ties alwayssomehow had histories, and such an impression was part of the interestcreated by this inordinate woman. As regards her relations with Mr.Osmond, however, she hinted at nothing but a long-established calmfriendship. Isabel said she should be happy to know a person who hadenjoyed so high a confidence for so many years. "You ought to see agreat many men," Madame Merle remarked; "you ought to see as many aspossible, so as to get used to them."</p><p>"Used to them?" Isabel repeated with that solemn stare whichsometimes seemed to proclaim her deficient in the sense of comedy."Why, I'm not afraid of them--I'm as used to them as the cook to thebutcher-boys."</p><p>"Used to them, I mean, so as to despise them. That's what one comesto with most of them. You'll pick out, for your society, the few whomyou don't despise."</p><p>This was a note of cynicism that Madame Merle didn't often allowherself to sound; but Isabel was not alarmed, for she had neversupposed that as one saw more of the world the sentiment of respectbecame the most active of one's emotions. It was excited, none theless, by the beautiful city of Florence, which pleased her not lessthan Madame Merle had promised; and if her unassisted perception hadnot been able to gauge its charms she had clever companions as prieststo the mystery. She was--in no want indeed of esthetic illumination,for Ralph found it a joy that renewed his own early passion to act ascicerone to his eager young kinswoman. Madame Merle remained at home;she had seen the treasures of Florence again and again and had alwayssomething else to do. But she talked of all things with remarkablevividness of memory--she recalled the right-hand corner of the largePerugino and the position of the hands of the Saint Elizabeth in thepicture next to it. She had her opinions as to the character of manyfamous works of art, differing often from Ralph with great sharpnessand defending her interpretations with as much ingenuity asgood-humour. Isabel listened to the discussions taking place betweenthe two with a sense that she might derive much benefit from them andthat they were among the advantages she couldn't have enjoyed forinstance in Albany. In the clear May mornings before the formalbreakfast--this repast at Mrs. Touchett's was served at twelveo'clock--she wandered with her cousin through the narrow and sombreFlorentine streets, resting a while in the thicker dusk of somehistoric church or the vaulted chambers of some dispeopled convent. Shewent to the galleries and palaces; she looked at the pictures andstatues that had hitherto been great names to her, and exchanged for aknowledge which was sometimes a limitation a presentiment which provedusually to have been a blank. She performed all those acts of mentalprostration in which, on a first visit to Italy, youth and enthusiasmso freely indulge; she felt her heart beat in the presence of immortalgenius and knew the sweetness of rising tears in eyes to which fadedfresco and darkened marble grew dim. But the return, every day, waseven pleasanter than the going forth; the return into the wide,monumental court of the great house in which Mrs. Touchett, many yearsbefore, had established herself, and into the high, cool rooms wherethe carven rafters and pompous frescoes of the sixteenth century lookeddown on the familiar commodities of the age of advertisement. Mrs.Touchett inhabited an historic building in a narrow street whose veryname recalled the strife of medieval factions; and found compensationfor the darkness of her frontage in the modicity of her rent and thebrightness of a garden where nature itself looked as archaic as therugged architecture of the palace and which cleared and scented therooms in regular use. To live in such a place was, for Isabel, to holdto her ear all day a shell of the sea of the past. This vague eternalrumour kept her imagination awake.</p><p>Gilbert Osmond came to see Madame Merle, who presented him to theyoung lady lurking at the other side of the room. Isabel took on thisoccasion little part in the talk; she scarcely even smiled when theothers turned to her invitingly; she sat there as if she had been atthe play and had paid even a large sum for her place. Mrs. Touchett wasnot present, and these two had it, for the effect of brilliancy, alltheir own way. They talked of the Florentine, the Roman, thecosmopolite world, and might have been distinguished performersfiguring for a charity. It all had the rich readiness that would havecome from rehearsal. Madame Merle appealed to her as if she had been onthe stage, but she could ignore any learnt cue without spoiling thescene--though of course she thus put dreadfully in the wrong the friendwho had told Mr. Osmond she could be depended on. This was no matterfor once; even if more had been involved she could have made no attemptto shine. There was something in the visitor that checked her and heldher in suspense--made it more important she should get an impression ofhim than that she should produce one herself. Besides, she had littleskill in producing an impression which she knew to be expected: nothingcould be happier, in general, than to seem dazzling, but she had aperverse unwillingness to glitter by arrangement. Mr. Osmond, to do himjustice, had a well-bred air of expecting nothing, a quiet ease thatcovered everything, even the first show of his own wit. This was themore grateful as his face, his head, was sensitive; he was nothandsome, but he was fine, as fine as one of the drawings in the longgallery above the bridge of the Uffizi. And his very voice wasfine--the more strangely that, with its clearness, it yet somehowwasn't sweet. This had had really to do with making her abstain frominterference. His utterance was the vibration of glass, and if she hadput out her finger she might have changed the pitch and spoiled theconcert. Yet before he went she had to speak.</p><p>"Madame Merle," he said, "consents to come up to my hill-top someday next week and drink tea in my garden. It would give me muchpleasure if you would come with her. It's thought rather pretty--there's what they call a general view. My daughter too would be soglad--or rather, for she's too young to have strong emotions, I shouldbe so glad--so very glad." And Mr. Osmond paused with a slight air ofembarrassment, leaving his sentence unfinished. "I should be so happyif you could know my daughter," he went on a moment afterwards.</p><p>Isabel replied that she should be delighted to see Miss Osmond andthat if Madame Merle would show her the way to the hill-top she shouldbe very grateful. Upon this assurance the visitor took his leave; afterwhich Isabel fully expected her friend would scold her for having beenso stupid. But to her surprise that lady, who indeed never fell intothe mere matter-of-course, said to her in a few moments</p><p>"You were charming, my dear; you were just as one would have wished you. You're never disappointing."</p><p>A rebuke might possibly have been irritating, though it is much moreprobable that Isabel would have taken it in good part; but, strange tosay, the words that Madame Merle actually used caused her the firstfeeling of displeasure she had known this ally to excite. "That's morethan I intended," she answered coldly. "I'm under no obligation that Iknow of to charm Mr. Osmond."</p><p>Madame Merle perceptibly flushed, but we know it was not her habitto retract. "My dear child, I didn't speak for him, poor man; I spokefor yourself. It's not of course a question as to his liking you; itmatters little whether he likes you or not! But I thought you likedHIM."</p><p>"I did," said Isabel honestly. "But I don't see what that matters either."</p><p>"Everything that concerns you matters to me," Madame Merle returnedwith her weary nobleness; "especially when at the same time another oldfriend's concerned."</p><p>Whatever Isabel's obligations may have been to Mr. Osmond, it mustbe admitted that she found them sufficient to lead her to put to Ralphsundry questions about him. She thought Ralph's judgements distorted byhis trials, but she flattered herself she had learned to make allowancefor that.</p><p>"Do I know him?" said her cousin. "Oh, yes, I 'know' him; not well,but on the whole enough. I've never cultivated his society, and heapparently has never found mine indispensable to his happiness. Who ishe, what is he? He's a vague, unexplained American who has been livingthese thirty years, or less, in Italy. Why do I call him unexplained?Only as a cover for my ignorance; I don't know his antecedents, hisfamily, his origin. For all I do know he may be a prince in disguise;he rather looks like one, by the way--like a prince who has abdicatedin a fit of fastidiousness and has been in a state of disgust eversince. He used to live in Rome; but of late years he has taken up hisabode here; I remember hearing him say that Rome has grown vulgar. Hehas a great dread of vulgarity; that's his special line; he hasn't anyother that I know of. He lives on his income, which I suspect of notbeing vulgarly large. He's a poor but honest gentleman that's what hecalls himself. He married young and lost his wife, and I believe he hasa daughter. He also has a sister, who's married to some small Count orother, of these parts; I remember meeting her of old. She's nicer thanhe, I should think, but rather impossible. I remember there used to besome stories about her. I don't think I recommend you to know her. Butwhy don't you ask Madame Merle about these people? She knows them allmuch better than I."</p><p>"I ask you because I want your opinion as well as hers," said Isabel.</p><p>"A fig for my opinion! If you fall in love with Mr. Osmond what will you care for that?"</p><p>"Not much, probably. But meanwhile it has a certain importance. The more information one has about one's dangers the better."</p><p>"I don't agree to that--it may make them dangers. We know too muchabout people in these days; we hear too much. Our ears, our minds, ourmouths, are stuffed with personalities. Don't mind anything any onetells you about any one else. Judge everyone and everything foryourself."</p><p>"That's what I try to do," said Isabel "but when you do that people call you conceited."</p><p>"You're not to mind them--that's precisely my argument; not to mindwhat they say about yourself any more than what they say about yourfriend or your enemy."</p><p>Isabel considered. "I think you're right; but there are some thingsI can't help minding: for instance when my friend's attacked or when Imyself am praised."</p><p>"Of course you're always at liberty to judge the critic. Judgepeople as critics, however," Ralph added, "and you'll condemn them all!"</p><p>"I shall see Mr. Osmond for myself," said Isabel. "I've promised to pay him a visit."</p><p>"To pay him a visit?"</p><p>"To go and see his view, his pictures, his daughter--I don't knowexactly what. Madame Merle's to take me; she tells me a great manyladies call on him."</p><p>"Ah, with Madame Merle you may go anywhere, de confiance," said Ralph. "She knows none but the best people."</p><p>Isabel said no more about Mr. Osmond, but she presently remarked toher cousin that she was not satisfied with his tone about Madame Merle."It seems to me you insinuate things about her. I don't know what youmean, but if you've any grounds for disliking her I think you shouldeither mention them frankly or else say nothing at all."</p><p>Ralph, however, resented this charge with more apparent earnestnessthan he commonly used. "I speak of Madame Merle exactly as I speak toher: with an even exaggerated respect."</p><p>"Exaggerated, precisely. That's what I complain of."</p><p>"I do so because Madame Merle's merits are exaggerated."</p><p>"By whom, pray? By me? If so I do her a poor service."</p><p>"No, no; by herself."</p><p>"Ah, I protest!" Isabel earnestly cried. "If ever there was a woman who made small claims--!"</p><p>"You put your finger on it," Ralph interrupted. "Her modesty'sexaggerated. She has no business with small claims--she has a perfectright to make large ones."</p><p>"Her merits are large then. You contradict yourself."</p><p>"Her merits are immense," said Ralph. "She's indescribablyblameless; a pathless desert of virtue; the only woman I know who nevergives one a chance."</p><p>"A chance for what?"</p><p>"Well, say to call her a fool! She's the only woman I know who has but that one little fault."</p><p>Isabel turned away with impatience. "I don't understand you; you're too paradoxical for my plain mind."</p><p>"Let me explain. When I say she exaggerates I don't mean it in thevulgar sense--that she boasts, overstates, gives too fine an account ofherself. I mean literally that she pushes the search for perfection toofar--that her merits are in themselves overstrained. She's too good,too kind, too clever, too learned, too accomplished, too everything.She's too complete, in a word. I confess to you that she acts on mynerves and that I feel about her a good deal as that intensely humanAthenian felt about Aristides the Just."</p><p>Isabel looked hard at her cousin; but the mocking spirit, if itlurked in his words, failed on this occasion to peep from his face. "Doyou wish Madame Merle to be banished?"</p><p>"By no means. She's much too good company. I delight in Madame Merle," said Ralph Touchett simply.</p><p>"You're very odious, sir!" Isabel exclaimed. And then she asked himif he knew anything that was not to the honour of her brilliant friend.</p><p>"Nothing whatever. Don't you see that's just what I mean? On thecharacter of every one else you may find some little black speck; if Iwere to take half an hour to it, some day, I've no doubt I should beable to find one on yours. For my own, of course, I'm spotted like aleopard. But on Madame Merle's nothing, nothing, nothing!"</p><p>"That's just what I think!" said Isabel with a toss of her head. "That is why I like her so much."</p><p>"She's a capital person for you to know. Since you wish to see the world you couldn't have a better guide."</p><p>"I suppose you mean by that that she's worldly?"</p><p>"Worldly? No," said Ralph, "she's the great round world itself!"</p><p>It had certainly not, as Isabel for the moment took it into her headto believe, been a refinement of malice in him to say that he delightedin Madame Merle. Ralph Touchett took his refreshment wherever he couldfind it, and he would not have forgiven himself if he had been leftwholly unbeguiled by such a mistress of the social art. There aredeep-lying sympathies and antipathies, and it may have been that, inspite of the administered justice she enjoyed at his hands, her absencefrom his mother's house would not have made life barren to him. ButRalph Touchett had learned more or less inscrutably to attend, andthere could have been nothing so "sustained" to attend to as thegeneral performance of Madame Merle. He tasted her in sips, he let herstand, with an opportuneness she herself could not have surpassed.There were moments when he felt almost sorry for her; and these, oddlyenough, were the moments when his kindness was least demonstrative. Hewas sure she had been yearningly ambitious and that what she hadvisibly accomplished was far below her secret measure. She had gotherself into perfect training, but had won none of the prizes. She wasalways plain Madame Merle, the widow of a Swiss negociant, with a smallincome and a large acquaintance, who stayed with people a great dealand was almost as universally "liked" as some new volume of smoothtwaddle. The contrast between this position and any one of somehalf-dozen others that he supposed to have at various moments engagedher hope had an element of the tragical. His mother thought he got onbeautifully with their genial guest; to Mrs. Touchett's sense twopersons who dealt so largely in too-ingenious theories of conduct--thatis of their own--would have much in common. He had given dueconsideration to Isabel's intimacy with her eminent friend, having longsince made up his mind that he could not, without opposition, keep hiscousin to himself; and he made the best of it, as he had done of worsethings. He believed it would take care of itself; it wouldn't lastforever. Neither of these two superior persons knew the other as wellas she supposed, and when each had made an important discovery or twothere would be, if not a rupture, at least a relaxation. Meanwhile hewas quite willing to admit that the conversation of the elder lady wasan advantage to the younger, who had a great deal to learn and woulddoubtless learn it better from Madame Merle than from some otherinstructors of the young. It was not probable that Isabel would beinjured.</p></span><span id = 973 ><p>It would certainly have been hard to see what injury could arise toher from the visit she presently paid to Mr. Osmond's hill-top. Nothingcould have been more charming than this occasion--a soft afternoon inthe full maturity of the Tuscan spring. The companions drove out of theRoman Gate, beneath the enormous blank superstructure which crowns thefine clear arch of that portal and makes it nakedly impressive, andwound between high-walled lanes into which the wealth of blossomingorchards over-drooped and flung a fragrance, until they reached thesmall superurban piazza, of crooked shape, where the long brown wall ofthe villa occupied in part by Mr. Osmond formed a principal, or atleast a very imposing, object. Isabel went with her friend through awide, high court, where a clear shadow rested below and a pair oflight-arched galleries, facing each other above, caught the uppersunshine upon their slim columns and the flowering plants in which theywere dressed. There was something grave and strong in the place; itlooked somehow as if, once you were in, you would need an act of energyto get out. For Isabel, however, there was of course as yet no thoughtof getting out, but only of advancing. Mr. Osmond met her in the coldante-chamber--it was cold even in the month of May--and ushered her,with her conductress, into the apartment to which we have already beenintroduced. Madame Merle was in front, and while Isabel lingered alittle, talking with him, she went forward familiarly and greeted twopersons who were seated in the saloon. One of these was little Pansy,on whom she bestowed a kiss; the other was a lady whom Mr. Osmondindicated to Isabel as his sister, the Countess Gemini. "And that's mylittle girl," he said, "who has just come out of her convent."</p><p>Pansy had on a scant white dress, and her fair hair was neatlyarranged in a net; she wore her small shoes tied sandal-fashion abouther ankles. She made Isabel a little conventual curtsey and then cameto be kissed. The Countess Gemini simply nodded without getting up:Isabel could see she was a woman of high fashion. She was thin and darkand not at all pretty, having features that suggested some tropicalbird--a long beak-like nose, small, quickly-moving eyes and a mouth andchin that receded extremely. Her expression, however, thanks to variousintensities of emphasis and wonder, of horror and joy, was not inhuman,and, as regards her appearance, it was plain she understood herself andmade the most of her points. Her attire, voluminous and delicate,bristling with elegance, had the look of shimmering plumage, and herattitudes were as light and sudden as those of a creature who perchedupon twigs. She had a great deal of manner; Isabel, who had never knownany one with so much manner, immediately classed her as the mostaffected of women. She remembered that Ralph had not recommended her asan acquaintance; but she was ready to acknowledge that to a casual viewthe Countess Gemini revealed no depths. Her demonstrations suggestedthe violent waving of some flag of general truce--white silk withfluttering streamers.</p><p>"You'll believe I'm glad to see you when I tell you it's onlybecause I knew you were to be here that I came myself. I don't come andsee my brother--I make him come and see me. This hill of his isimpossible--I don't see what possesses him. Really, Osmond, you'll bethe ruin of my horses some day, and if it hurts them you'll have togive me another pair. I heard them wheezing to-day; I assure you I did.It's very disagreeable to hear one's horses wheezing when one's sittingin the carriage; it sounds too as if they weren't what they should be.But I've always had good horses; whatever else I may have lacked I'vealways managed that. My husband doesn't know much, but I think he knowsa horse. In general Italians don't, but my husband goes in, accordingto his poor light, for everything English. My horses are English--soit's all the greater pity they should be ruined. I must tell you," shewent on, directly addressing Isabel, "that Osmond doesn't often inviteme; I don't think he likes to have me. It was quite my own idea, comingto-day. I like to see new people, and I'm sure you're very new. Butdon't sit there; that chair's not what it looks. There are some verygood seats here, but there are also some horrors."</p><p>These remarks were delivered with a series of little jerks andpecks, of roulades of shrillness, and in an accent that was as somefond recall of good English, or rather of good American, in adversity.</p><p>"I don't like to have you, my dear?" said her brother. "I'm sure you're invaluable."</p><p>"I don't see any horrors anywhere," Isabel returned, looking about her. "Everything seems to me beautiful and precious."</p><p>"I've a few good things," Mr. Osmond allowed; "indeed I've nothing very bad. But I've not what I should have liked."</p><p>He stood there a little awkwardly, smiling and glancing about; hismanner was an odd mixture of the detached and the involved. He seemedto hint that nothing but the right "values" was of any consequence.Isabel made a rapid induction: perfect simplicity was not the badge ofhis family. Even the little girl from the convent, who, in her primwhite dress, with her small submissive face and her hands locked beforeher, stood there as if she were about to partake of her firstcommunion, even Mr. Osmond's diminutive daughter had a kind of finishthat was not entirely artless.</p><p>"You'd have liked a few things from the Uffzi and the Pitti-- that's what you'd have liked," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"Poor Osmond, with his old curtains and crucifixes!" the CountessGemini exclaimed: she appeared to call her brother only by hisfamily-name. Her ejaculation had no particular object; she smiled atIsabel as she made it and looked at her from head to foot.</p><p>Her brother had not heard her; he seemed to be thinking what hecould say to Isabel. "Won't you have some tea?--you must be verytired," he at last bethought himself of remarking.</p><p>"No indeed, I'm not tired; what have I done to tire me?" Isabel felta certain need of being very direct, of pretending to nothing; therewas something in the air, in her general impression of things--shecould hardly have said what it was--that deprived her of alldisposition to put herself forward. The place, the occasion, thecombination of people, signified more than lay on the surface; shewould try to understand--she would not simply utter gracefulplatitudes. Poor Isabel was doubtless not aware that many women wouldhave uttered graceful platitudes to cover the working of theirobservation. It must be confessed that her pride was a trifle alarmed.A man she had heard spoken of in terms that excited interest and whowas evidently capable of distinguishing himself, had invited her, ayoung lady not lavish of her favours, to come to his house. Now thatshe had done so the burden of the entertainment rested naturally on hiswit. Isabel was not rendered less observant, and for the moment, wejudge, she was not rendered more indulgent, by perceiving that Mr.Osmond carried his burden less complacently than might have beenexpected. "What a fool I was to have let myself so needlessly in--!"she could fancy his exclaiming to himself.</p><p>"You'll be tired when you go home, if he shows you all his bibelots and gives you a lecture on each," said the Countess Gemini.</p><p>"I'm not afraid of that; but if I'm tired I shall at least have learned something."</p><p>"Very little, I suspect. But my sister's dreadfully afraid of learning anything," said Mr. Osmond.</p><p>"Oh, I confess to that; I don't want to know anything more--I knowtoo much already. The more you know the more unhappy you are."</p><p>"You should not undervalue knowledge before Pansy, who has notfinished her education," Madame Merle interposed with a smile. "Pansywill never know any harm," said the child's father. "Pansy's a littleconvent-flower."</p><p>"Oh, the convents, the convents!" cried the Countess with a flutterof her ruffles. "Speak to me of the convents! You may learn anythingthere; I'm a convent-flower myself. I don't pretend to be good, but thenuns do. Don't you see what I mean?" she went on, appealing to Isabel.</p><p>Isabel was not sure she saw, and she answered that she was very badat following arguments. The Countess then declared that she herselfdetested arguments, but that this was her brother's taste --he wouldalways discuss. "For me," she said, "one should like a thing or oneshouldn't; one can't like everything, of course. But one shouldn'tattempt to reason it out--you never know where it may lead you. Thereare some very good feelings that may have bad reasons, don't you know?And then there are very bad feelings, sometimes, that have goodreasons. Don't you see what I mean? I don't care anything aboutreasons, but I know what I like."</p><p>"Ah, that's the great thing," said Isabel, smiling and suspectingthat her acquaintance with this lightly flitting personage would notlead to intellectual repose. If the Countess objected to argumentIsabel at this moment had as little taste for it, and she put out herhand to Pansy with a pleasant sense that such a gesture committed herto nothing that would admit of a divergence of views. Gilbert Osmondapparently took a rather hopeless view of his sister's tone; he turnedthe conversation to another topic. He presently sat down on the otherside of his daughter, who had shyly brushed Isabel's fingers with herown; but he ended by drawing her out of her chair and making her standbetween his knees, leaning against him while he passed his arm roundher slimness. The child fixed her eyes on Isabel with a still,disinterested gaze which seemed void of an intention, yet conscious ofan attraction. Mr. Osmond talked of many things; Madame Merle had saidhe could be agreeable when he chose, and to-day, after a little, heappeared not only to have chosen but to have determined. Madame Merleand the Countess Gemini sat a little apart, conversing in theeffortless manner of persons who knew each other well enough to taketheir ease; but every now and then Isabel heard the Countess, atsomething said by her companion, plunge into the latter's lucidity as apoodle splashes after a thrown stick. It was as if Madame Merle wereseeing how far she would go. Mr. Osmond talked of Florence, of Italy,of the pleasure of living in that country and of the abatements to thepleasure. There were both satisfactions and drawbacks; the drawbackswere numerous; strangers were too apt to see such a world as allromantic. It met the case soothingly for the human, for the socialfailure--by which he meant the people who couldn't "realise," as theysaid, on their sensibility: they could keep it about them there, intheir poverty, without ridicule, as you might keep an heirloom or aninconvenient entailed place that brought you in nothing. Thus therewere advantages in living in the country which contained the greatestsum of beauty. Certain impressions you could get only there. Others,favourable to life, you never got, and you got some that were very bad.But from time to time you got one of a quality that made up foreverything. Italy, all the same, had spoiled a great many people; hewas even fatuous enough to believe at times that he himself might havebeen a better man if he had spent less of his life there. It made oneidle and dilettantish and second-rate; it had no discipline for thecharacter, didn't cultivate in you, otherwise expressed, the successfulsocial and other "cheek" that flourished in Paris and London. "We'resweetly provincial," said Mr. Osmond, "and I'm perfectly aware that Imyself am as rusty as a key that has no lock to fit it. It polishes meup a little to talk with you--not that I venture to pretend I can turnthat very complicated lock I suspect your intellect of being! Butyou'll be going away before I've seen you three times, and I shallperhaps never see you after that. That's what it is to live in acountry that people come to. When they're disagreeable here it's badenough; when they're agreeable it's still worse. As soon as you likethem they're off again! I've been deceived too often; I've ceased toform attachments, to permit myself to feel attractions. You mean tostay--to settle? That would be really comfortable. Ah yes, your aunt'sa sort of guarantee; I believe she may be depended on. Oh, she's an oldFlorentine; I mean literally an old one; not a modern outsider. She's acontemporary of the Medici; she must have been present at the burningof Savonarola, and I'm not sure she didn't throw a handful of chipsinto the flame. Her face is very much like some faces in the earlypictures; little, dry, definite faces that must have had a good deal ofexpression, but almost always the same one. Indeed I can show you herportrait in a fresco of Ghirlandaio's. I hope you don't object to myspeaking that way of your aunt, eh? I've an idea you don't. Perhaps youthink that's even worse. I assure you there's no want of respect in it,to either of you. You know I'm a particular admirer of Mrs. Touchett."</p><p>While Isabel's host exerted himself to entertain her in thissomewhat confidential fashion she looked occasionally at Madame Merle,who met her eyes with an inattentive smile in which, on this occasion,there was no infelicitous intimation that our heroine appeared toadvantage. Madame Merle eventually proposed to the Countess Gemini thatthey should go into the garden, and the Countess, rising and shakingout her feathers, began to rustle toward the door. "Poor Miss Archer!"she exclaimed, surveying the other group with expressive compassion."She has been brought quite into the family."</p><p>"Miss Archer can certainly have nothing but sympathy for a family towhich you belong," Mr. Osmond answered, with a laugh which, though ithad something of a mocking ring, had also a finer patience.</p><p>"I don't know what you mean by that! I'm sure she'll see no harm inme but what you tell her. I'm better than he says, Miss Archer," theCountess went on. "I'm only rather an idiot and a bore. Is that all hehas said? Ah then, you keep him in good-humour. Has he opened on one ofhis favourite subjects? I give you notice that there are two or threethat he treats a fond. In that case you had better take off yourbonnet."</p><p>"I don't think I know what Mr. Osmond's favourite subjects are," said Isabel, who had risen to her feet.</p><p>The Countess assumed for an instant an attitude of intensemeditation, pressing one of her hands, with the finger-tips gatheredtogether, to her forehead. "I'll tell you in a moment. One'sMachiavelli; the other's Vittoria Colonna; the next is Metastasio."</p><p>"Ah, with me," said Madame Merle, passing her arm into the CountessGemini's as if to guide her course to the garden, "Mr. Osmond's neverso historical."</p><p>"Oh you," the Countess answered as they moved away, "you yourself are Machiavelli--you yourself are Vittoria Colonna!"</p><p>"We shall hear next that poor Madame Merle is Metastasio!" Gilbert Osmond resignedly sighed.</p><p>Isabel had got up on the assumption that they too were to go intothe garden; but her host stood there with no apparent inclination toleave the room, his hands in the pockets of his jacket and hisdaughter, who had now locked her arm into one of his own, clinging tohim and looking up while her eyes moved from his own face to Isabel's.Isabel waited, with a certain unuttered contentedness, to have hermovements directed; she liked Mr. Osmond's talk, his company: she hadwhat always gave her a very private thrill, the consciousness of a newrelation. Through the open doors of the great room she saw Madame Merleand the Countess stroll across the fine grass of the garden; then sheturned, and her eyes wandered over the things scattered about her. Theunderstanding had been that Mr. Osmond should show her his treasures;his pictures and cabinets all looked like treasures. Isabel after amoment went toward one of the pictures to see it better; but just asshe had done so he said to her abruptly: "Miss Archer, what do youthink of my sister?"</p><p>She faced him with some surprise. "Ah, don't ask me that--I've seen your sister too little."</p><p>"Yes, you've seen her very little; but you must have observed thatthere is not a great deal of her to see. What do you think of ourfamily tone?" he went on with his cool smile. "I should like to knowhow it strikes a fresh, unprejudiced mind. I know what you're going tosay--you've had almost no observation of it. Of course this is only aglimpse. But just take notice, in future, if you have a chance. Isometimes think we've got into a rather bad way, living off here amongthings and people not our own, without responsibilities or attachments,with nothing to hold us together or keep us up; marrying foreigners,forming artificial tastes, playing tricks with our natural mission. Letme add, though, that I say that much more for myself than for mysister. She's a very honest lady--more so than she seems. She's ratherunhappy, and as she's not of a serious turn she doesn't tend to show ittragically: she shows it comically instead. She has got a horridhusband, though I'm not sure she makes the best of him. Of course,however, a horrid husband's an awkward thing. Madame Merle gives herexcellent advice, but it's a good deal like giving a child a dictionaryto learn a language with. He can look out the words, but he can't putthem together. My sister needs a grammar, but unfortunately she's notgrammatical. Pardon my troubling you with these details; my sister wasvery right in saying you've been taken into the family. Let me takedown that picture; you want more light."</p><p>He took down the picture, carried it toward the window, related somecurious facts about it. She looked at the other works of art, and hegave her such further information as might appear most acceptable to ayoung lady making a call on a summer afternoon. His pictures, hismedallions and tapestries were interesting; but after a while Isabelfelt the owner much more so, and independently of them, thickly as theyseemed to overhang him. He resembled no one she had ever seen; most ofthe people she knew might be divided into groups of half a dozenspecimens. There were one or two exceptions to this; she could thinkfor instance of no group that would contain her aunt Lydia. There wereother people who were, relatively speaking, original-- original, as onemight say, by courtesy such as Mr. Goodwood, as her cousin Ralph, asHenrietta Stackpole, as Lord Warburton, as Madame Merle. But inessentials, when one came to look at them, these individuals belongedto types already present to her mind. Her mind contained no classoffering a natural place to Mr. Osmond--he was a specimen apart. It wasnot that she recognised all these truths at the hour, but they werefalling into order before her. For the moment she only said to herselfthat this "new relation" would perhaps prove her very mostdistinguished. Madame Merle had had that note of rarity, but what quiteother power it immediately gained when sounded by a man! It was not somuch what he said and did, but rather what he withheld, that marked himfor her as by one of those signs of the highly curious that he wasshowing her on the underside of old plates and in the corner ofsixteenth-century drawings: he indulged in no striking deflections fromcommon usage, he was an original without being an eccentric. She hadnever met a person of so fine a grain. The peculiarity was physical, tobegin with, and it extended to impalpabilities. His dense, delicatehair, his overdrawn, retouched features, his clear complexion, ripewithout being coarse, the very evenness of the growth of his beard, andthat light, smooth slenderness of structure which made the movement ofa single one of his fingers produce the effect of an expressivegesture--these personal points struck our sensitive young woman assigns of quality, of intensity, somehow as promises of interest. He wascertainly fastidious and critical; he was probably irritable. Hissensibility had governed him--possibly governed him too much; it hadmade him impatient of vulgar troubles and had led him to live byhimself, in a sorted, sifted, arranged world, thinking about art andbeauty and history. He had consulted his taste in everything--his tastealone perhaps, as a sick man consciously incurable consults at lastonly his lawyer: that was what made him so different from every oneelse. Ralph had something of this same quality, this appearance ofthinking that life was a matter of connoisseurship; but in Ralph it wasan anomaly, a kind of humorous excrescence, whereas in Mr. Osmond itwas the keynote, and everything was in harmony with it. She wascertainly far from understanding him completely; his meaning was not atall times obvious. It was hard to see what he meant for instance byspeaking of his provincial side--which was exactly the side she wouldhave taken him most to lack. Was it a harmless paradox, intended topuzzle her? or was it the last refinement of high culture? She trustedshe should learn in time; it would be very interesting to learn. If itwas provincial to have that harmony, what then was the finish of thecapital? And she could put this question in spite of so feeling herhost a shy personage; since such shyness as his--the shyness ofticklish nerves and fine perceptions--was perfectly consistent with thebest breeding. Indeed it was almost a proof of standards andtouchstones other than the vulgar: he must be so sure the vulgar wouldbe first on the ground. He wasn't a man of easy assurance, who chattedand gossiped with the fluency of a superficial nature; he was criticalof himself as well as of others, and, exacting a good deal of others,to think them agreeable, probably took a rather ironical view of whathe himself offered: a proof into the bargain that he was not grosslyconceited. If he had not been shy he wouldn't have effected thatgradual, subtle, successful conversion of it to which she owed bothwhat pleased her in him and what mystified her. If he had suddenlyasked her what she thought of the Countess Gemini, that was doubtless aproof that he was interested in her; it could scarcely be as a help toknowledge of his own sister. That he should be so interested showed anenquiring mind; but it was a little singular he should sacrifice hisfraternal feeling to his curiosity. This was the most eccentric thinghe had done.</p><p>There were two other rooms, beyond the one in which she had beenreceived, equally full of romantic objects, and in these apartmentsIsabel spent a quarter of an hour. Everything was in the last degreecurious and precious, and Mr. Osmond continued to be the kindest ofciceroni as he led her from one fine piece to another and still heldhis little girl by the hand. His kindness almost surprised our youngfriend, who wondered why he should take so much trouble for her; andshe was oppressed at last with the accumulation of beauty and knowledgeto which she found herself introduced. There was enough for thepresent; she had ceased to attend to what he said; she listened to himwith attentive eyes, but was not thinking of what he told her. Heprobably thought her quicker, cleverer in every way, more prepared,than she was. Madame Merle would have pleasantly exaggerated; which wasa pity, because in the end he would be sure to find out, and thenperhaps even her real intelligence wouldn't reconcile him to hismistake. A part of Isabel's fatigue came from the effort to appear asintelligent as she believed Madame Merle had described her, and fromthe fear (very unusual with her) of exposing--not her ignorance; forthat she cared comparatively little--but her possible grossness ofperception. It would have annoyed her to express a liking for somethinghe, in his superior enlightenment, would think she oughtn't to like; orto pass by something at which the truly initiated mind would arrestitself. She had no wish to fall into that grotesqueness-- in which shehad seen women (and it was a warning) serenely, yet ignobly, flounder.She was very careful therefore as to what she said, as to what shenoticed or failed to notice; more careful than she had ever been before.</p><p>They came back into the first of the rooms, where the tea had beenserved; but as the two other ladies were still on the terrace, and asIsabel had not yet been made acquainted with the view, the paramountdistinction of the place, Mr. Osmond directed her steps into the gardenwithout more delay. Madame Merle and the Countess had had chairsbrought out, and as the afternoon was lovely the Countess proposed theyshould take their tea in the open air. Pansy therefore was sent to bidthe servant bring out the preparations. The sun had got low, the goldenlight took a deeper tone, and on the mountains and the plain thatstretched beneath them the masses of purple shadow glowed as richly asthe places that were still exposed. The scene had an extraordinarycharm. The air was almost solemnly still, and the large expanse of thelandscape, with its garden-like culture and nobleness of outline, itsteeming valley and delicately-fretted hills, its peculiarlyhuman-looking touches of habitation, lay there in splendid harmony andclassic grace. "You seem so well pleased that I think you can betrusted to come back," Osmond said as he led his companion to one ofthe angles of the terrace.</p><p>"I shall certainly come back," she returned, "in spite of what yousay about its being bad to live in Italy. What was that you said aboutone's natural mission? I wonder if I should forsake my natural missionif I were to settle in Florence."</p><p>"A woman's natural mission is to be where she's most appreciated."</p><p>"The point's to find out where that is."</p><p>"Very true--she often wastes a great deal of time in the enquiry. People ought to make it very plain to her."</p><p>"Such a matter would have to be made very plain to me," smiled Isabel.</p><p>"I'm glad, at any rate, to hear you talk of settling. Madame Merlehad given me an idea that you were of a rather roving disposition. Ithought she spoke of your having some plan of going round the world."</p><p>"I'm rather ashamed of my plans; I make a new one every day."</p><p>"I don't see why you should be ashamed; it's the greatest of pleasures."</p><p>"It seems frivolous, I think," said Isabel. "One ought to choose something very deliberately, and be faithful to that."</p><p>"By that rule then, I've not been frivolous."</p><p>"Have you never made plans?"</p><p>"Yes, I made one years ago, and I'm acting on it to-day."</p><p>"It must have been a very pleasant one," Isabel permitted herself to observe.</p><p>"It was very simple. It was to be as quiet as possible."</p><p>"As quiet?" the girl repeated.</p><p>"Not to worry--not to strive nor struggle. To resign myself. To becontent with little." He spoke these sentences slowly, with shortpauses between, and his intelligent regard was fixed on his visitor'swith the conscious air of a man who has brought himself to confesssomething.</p><p>"Do you call that simple?" she asked with mild irony.</p><p>"Yes, because it's negative."</p><p>"Has your life been negative?"</p><p>"Call it affirmative if you like. Only it has affirmed myindifference. Mind you, not my natural indifference--I HAD none. But mystudied, my wilful renunciation."</p><p>She scarcely understood him; it seemed a question whether he werejoking or not. Why should a man who struck her as having a great fundof reserve suddenly bring himself to be so confidential? This was hisaffair, however, and his confidences were interesting. "I don't see whyyou should have renounced," she said in a moment.</p><p>"Because I could do nothing. I had no prospects, I was poor, and Iwas not a man of genius. I had no talents even; I took my measure earlyin life. I was simply the most fastidious young gentleman living. Therewere two or three people in the world I envied--the Emperor of Russia,for instance, and the Sultan of Turkey! There were even moments when Ienvied the Pope of Rome-- for the consideration he enjoys. I shouldhave been delighted to be considered to that extent; but since thatcouldn't be I didn't care for anything less, and I made up my mind notto go in for honours. The leanest gentleman can always considerhimself, and fortunately I was, though lean, a gentleman. I could donothing in Italy--I couldn't even be an Italian patriot. To do that Ishould have had to get out of the country; and I was too fond of it toleave it, to say nothing of my being too well satisfied with it, on thewhole, as it then was, to wish it altered. So I've passed a great manyyears here on that quiet plan I spoke of. I've not been at all unhappy.I don't mean to say I've cared for nothing; but the things I've caredfor have been definite-- limited. The events of my life have beenabsolutely unperceived by any one save myself; getting an old silvercrucifix at a bargain (I've never bought anything dear, of course), ordiscovering, as I once did, a sketch by Correggio on a panel daubedover by some inspired idiot."</p><p>This would have been rather a dry account of Mr. Osmond's career ifIsabel had fully believed it; but her imagination supplied the humanelement which she was sure had not been wanting. His life had beenmingled with other lives more than he admitted; naturally she couldn'texpect him to enter into this. For the present she abstained fromprovoking further revelations; to intimate that he had not told hereverything would be more familiar and less considerate than she nowdesired to be--would in fact be uproariously vulgar. He had certainlytold her quite enough. It was her present inclination, however, toexpress a measured sympathy for the success with which he had preservedhis independence. "That's a very pleasant life," she said, "to renounceeverything but Correggio!"</p><p>"Oh, I've made in my way a good thing of it. Don't imagine I'm whining about it. It's one's own fault if one isn't happy."</p><p>This was large; she kept down to something smaller. "Have you lived here always?"</p><p>"No, not always. I lived a long time at Naples, and many years inRome. But I've been here a good while. Perhaps I shall have to change,however; to do something else. I've no longer myself to think of. Mydaughter's growing up and may very possibly not care so much for theCorreggios and crucifixes as I. I shall have to do what's best forPansy."</p><p>"Yes, do that," said Isabel. "She's such a dear little girl."</p><p>"Ah," cried Gilbert Osmond beautifully, "she's a little saint of heaven! She is my great happiness!"</p></span><span id = 974 ><p>While this sufficiently intimate colloquy (prolonged for some timeafter we cease to follow it) went forward Madame Merle and hercompanion, breaking a silence of some duration, had begun to exchangeremarks. They were sitting in an attitude of unexpressed expectancy; anattitude especially marked on the part of the Countess Gemini, who,being of a more nervous temperament than her friend, practised withless success the art of disguising impatience. What these ladies werewaiting for would not have been apparent and was perhaps not verydefinite to their own minds. Madame Merle waited for Osmond to releasetheir young friend from her tete-a-tete, and the Countess waitedbecause Madame Merle did. The Countess, moreover, by waiting, found thetime ripe for one of her pretty perversities. She might have desiredfor some minutes to place it. Her brother wandered with Isabel to theend of the garden, to which point her eyes followed them.</p><p>"My dear," she then observed to her companion, "you'll excuse me if I don't congratulate you!"</p><p>"Very willingly, for I don't in the least know why you should."</p><p>"Haven't you a little plan that you think rather well of?" And the Countess nodded at the sequestered couple.</p><p>Madame Merle's eyes took the same direction; then she lookedserenely at her neighbour. "You know I never understand you very well,"she smiled.</p><p>"No one can understand better than you when you wish. I see that just now you DON'T wish."</p><p>"You say things to me that no one else does," said Madame Merle gravely, yet without bitterness.</p><p>"You mean things you don't like? Doesn't Osmond sometimes say such things?"</p><p>"What your brother says has a point."</p><p>"Yes, a poisoned one sometimes. If you mean that I'm not so cleveras he you mustn't think I shall suffer from your sense of ourdifference. But it will be much better that you should understand me."</p><p>"Why so?" asked Madame Merle. "To what will it conduce?"</p><p>"If I don't approve of your plan you ought to know it in order to appreciate the danger of my interfering with it."</p><p>Madame Merle looked as if she were ready to admit that there mightbe something in this; but in a moment she said quietly: "You think memore calculating than I am."</p><p>"It's not your calculating I think ill of; it's your calculating wrong. You've done so in this case."</p><p>"You must have made extensive calculations yourself to discover that."</p><p>"No, I've not had time. I've seen the girl but this once," said theCountess, "and the conviction has suddenly come to me. I like her verymuch."</p><p>"So do I," Madame Merle mentioned.</p><p>"You've a strange way of showing it."</p><p>"Surely I've given her the advantage of making your acquaintance."</p><p>"That indeed," piped the Countess, "is perhaps the best thing that could happen to her!"</p><p>Madame Merle said nothing for some time. The Countess's manner wasodious, was really low; but it was an old story, and with her eyes uponthe violet slope of Monte Morello she gave herself up to reflection."My dear lady," she finally resumed, "I advise you not to agitateyourself. The matter you allude to concerns three persons much strongerof purpose than yourself."</p><p>"Three persons? You and Osmond of course. But is Miss Archer also very strong of purpose?"</p><p>"Quite as much so as we."</p><p>"Ah then," said the Countess radiantly, "if I convince her it's her interest to resist you she'll do so successfully!"</p><p>"Resist us? Why do you express yourself so coarsely? She's not exposed to compulsion or deception."</p><p>"I'm not sure of that. You're capable of anything, you and Osmond. Idon't mean Osmond by himself, and I don't mean you by yourself. Buttogether you're dangerous--like some chemical combination."</p><p>"You had better leave us alone then," smiled Madame Merle.</p><p>"I don't mean to touch you--but I shall talk to that girl."</p><p>"My poor Amy," Madame Merle murmured, "I don't see what has got into your head."</p><p>"I take an interest in her--that's what has got into my head. I like her."</p><p>Madame Merle hesitated a moment. "I don't think she likes you."</p><p>The Countess's bright little eyes expanded and her face was set in a grimace. "Ah, you ARE dangerous--even by yourself!"</p><p>"If you want her to like you don't abuse your brother to her," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"I don't suppose you pretend she has fallen in love with him in two interviews."</p><p>Madame Merle looked a moment at Isabel and at the master of thehouse. He was leaning against the parapet, facing her, his arms folded;and she at present was evidently not lost in the mere impersonal view,persistently as she gazed at it. As Madame Merle watched her shelowered her eyes; she was listening, possibly with a certainembarrassment, while she pressed the point of her parasol into thepath. Madame Merle rose from her chair. "Yes, I think so!" shepronounced.</p><p>The shabby footboy, summoned by Pansy--he might, tarnished as tolivery and quaint as to type, have issued from some stray sketch ofold-time manners, been "put in" by the brush of a Longhi or a Goya--hadcome out with a small table and placed it on the grass, and then hadgone back and fetched the tea-tray; after which he had againdisappeared, to return with a couple of chairs. Pansy had watched theseproceedings with the deepest interest, standing with her small handsfolded together upon the front of her scanty frock; but she had notpresumed to offer assistance. When the tea-table had been arranged,however, she gently approached her aunt.</p><p>"Do you think papa would object to my making the tea?"</p><p>The Countess looked at her with a deliberately critical gaze andwithout answering her question. "My poor niece," she said, "is thatyour best frock?"</p><p>"Ah no," Pansy answered, "it's just a little toilette for common occasions."</p><p>"Do you call it a common occasion when I come to see you?--to say nothing of Madame Merle and the pretty lady yonder."</p><p>Pansy reflected a moment, turning gravely from one of the personsmentioned to the other. Then her face broke into its perfect smile. "Ihave a pretty dress, but even that one's very simple. Why should Iexpose it beside your beautiful things?"</p><p>"Because it's the prettiest you have; for me you must always wearthe prettiest. Please put it on the next time. It seems to me theydon't dress you so well as they might."</p><p>The child sparingly stroked down her antiquated skirt. "It's a goodlittle dress to make tea--don't you think? Don't you believe papa wouldallow me?"</p><p>"Impossible for me to say, my child," said the Countess. "For me,your father's ideas are unfathomable. Madame Merle understands thembetter. Ask HER."</p><p>Madame Merle smiled with her usual grace. "It's a weightyquestion--let me think. It seems to me it would please your father tosee a careful little daughter making his tea. It's the proper duty ofthe daughter of the house--when she grows up."</p><p>"So it seems to me, Madame Merle!" Pansy cried. "You shall see howwell I'll make it. A spoonful for each." And she began to busy herselfat the table.</p><p>"Two spoonfuls for me," said the Countess, who, with Madame Merle,remained for some moments watching her. "Listen to me, Pansy," theCountess resumed at last. "I should like to know what you think of yourvisitor."</p><p>"Ah, she's not mine--she's papa's," Pansy objected.</p><p>"Miss Archer came to see you as well," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"I'm very happy to hear that. She has been very polite to me."</p><p>"Do you like her then?" the Countess asked.</p><p>"She's charming--charming," Pansy repeated in her little neat conversational tone. "She pleases me thoroughly."</p><p>"And how do you think she pleases your father?"</p><p>"Ah really, Countess!" murmured Madame Merle dissuasively. "Go and call them to tea," she went on to the child.</p><p>"You'll see if they don't like it!" Pansy declared; and departed tosummon the others, who had still lingered at the end of the terrace.</p><p>"If Miss Archer's to become her mother it's surely interesting to know if the child likes her," said the Countess.</p><p>"If your brother marries again it won't be for Pansy's sake," MadameMerle replied. "She'll soon be sixteen, and after that she'll begin toneed a husband rather than a stepmother."</p><p>"And will you provide the husband as well?"</p><p>"I shall certainly take an interest in her marrying fortunately. I imagine you'll do the same."</p><p>"Indeed I shan't!" cried the Countess. "Why should I, of all women, set such a price on a husband?"</p><p>"You didn't marry fortunately; that's what I'm speaking of. When I say a husband I mean a good one."</p><p>"There are no good ones. Osmond won't be a good one."</p><p>Madame Merle closed her eyes a moment. "You're irritated just now; Idon't know why," she presently said. "I don't think you'll reallyobject either to your brother's or to your niece's marrying, when thetime comes for them to do so; and as regards Pansy I'm confident thatwe shall some day have the pleasure of looking for a husband for hertogether. Your large acquaintance will be a great help."</p><p>"Yes, I'm irritated," the Countess answered. "You often irritate me. Your own coolness is fabulous. You're a strange woman."</p><p>"It's much better that we should always act together," Madame Merle went on.</p><p>"Do you mean that as a threat?" asked the Countess rising. MadameMerle shook her head as for quiet amusement. "No indeed, you've not mycoolness!"</p><p>Isabel and Mr. Osmond were now slowly coming toward them and Isabelhad taken Pansy by the hand. "Do you pretend to believe he'd make herhappy?" the Countess demanded.</p><p>"If he should marry Miss Archer I suppose he'd behave like a gentleman."</p><p>The Countess jerked herself into a succession of attitudes. "Do youmean as most gentlemen behave? That would be much to be thankful for!Of course Osmond's a gentleman; his own sister needn't be reminded ofthat. But does he think he can marry any girl he happens to pick out?Osmond's a gentleman, of course; but I must say I've NEVER, no, no,never, seen any one of Osmond's pretensions! What they're all foundedon is more than I can say. I'm his own sister; I might he supposed toknow. Who is he, if you please? What has he ever done? If there hadbeen anything particularly grand in his origin--if he were made of somesuperior clay--I presume I should have got some inkling of it. If therehad been any great honours or splendours in the family I shouldcertainly have made the most of them: they would have been quite in myline. But there's nothing, nothing, nothing. One's parents werecharming people of course; but so were yours, I've no doubt. Everyone's a charming person nowadays. Even I'm a charming person; don'tlaugh, it has literally been said. As for Osmond, he has alwaysappeared to believe that he's descended from the gods."</p><p>"You may say what you please," said Madame Merle, who had listenedto this quick outbreak none the less attentively, we may believe,because her eye wandered away from the speaker and her hands busiedthemselves with adjusting the knots of ribbon on her dress. "YouOsmonds are a fine race--your blood must flow from some very puresource. Your brother, like an intelligent man, has had the convictionof it if he has not had the proofs. You're modest about it, but youyourself are extremely distinguished. What do you say about your niece?The child's a little princess. Nevertheless," Madame Merle added, "itwon't be an easy matter for Osmond to marry Miss Archer. Yet he cantry."</p><p>"I hope she'll refuse him. It will take him down a little."</p><p>"We mustn't forget that he is one of the cleverest of men."</p><p>"I've heard you say that before, but I haven't yet discovered what he has done."</p><p>"What he has done? He has done nothing that has had to be undone. And he has known how to wait."</p><p>"To wait for Miss Archer's money? How much of it is there?"</p><p>"That's not what I mean," said Madame Merle. "Miss Archer has seventy thousand pounds."</p><p>"Well, it's a pity she's so charming," the Countess declared. "To be sacrificed, any girl would do. She needn't be superior."</p><p>"If she weren't superior your brother would never look at her. He must have the best."</p><p>"Yes," returned the Countess as they went forward a little to meetthe others, "he's very hard to satisfy. That makes me tremble for herhappiness!"</p></span><span id = 975 ><p>Gilbert Osmond came to see Isabel again; that is he came to PalazzoCrescentini. He had other friends there as well, and to Mrs. Touchettand Madame Merle he was always impartially civil; but the former ofthese ladies noted the fact that in the course of a fortnight he calledfive times, and compared it with another fact that she found nodifficulty in remembering. Two visits a year had hitherto constitutedhis regular tribute to Mrs. Touchett's worth, and she had neverobserved him select for such visits those moments, of almost periodicalrecurrence, when Madame Merle was under her roof. It was not for MadameMerle that he came; these two were old friends and he never put himselfout for her. He was not fond of Ralph--Ralph had told her so--and itwas not supposable that Mr. Osmond had suddenly taken a fancy to herson. Ralph was imperturbable--Ralph had a kind of loose-fittingurbanity that wrapped him about like an ill-made overcoat, but of whichhe never divested himself; he thought Mr. Osmond very good company andwas willing at any time to look at him in the light of hospitality. Buthe didn't flatter himself that the desire to repair a past injusticewas the motive of their visitor's calls; he read the situation moreclearly. Isabel was the attraction, and in all conscience a sufficientone. Osmond was a critic, a student of the exquisite, and it wasnatural he should be curious of so rare an apparition. So when hismother observed to him that it was plain what Mr. Osmond was thinkingof, Ralph replied that he was quite of her opinion. Mrs. Touchett hadfrom far back found a place on her scant list for this gentleman,though wondering dimly by what art and what process--so negative and sowise as they were--he had everywhere effectively imposed himself. As hehad never been an importunate visitor he had had no chance to beoffensive, and he was recommended to her by his appearance of being aswell able to do without her as she was to do without him--a qualitythat always, oddly enough, affected her as providing ground for arelation with her. It gave her no satisfaction, however, to think thathe had taken it into his head to marry her niece. Such an alliance, onIsabel's part, would have an air of almost morbid perversity. Mrs.Touchett easily remembered that the girl had refused an English peer;and that a young lady with whom Lord Warburton had not successfullywrestled should content herself with an obscure American dilettante, amiddle-aged widower with an uncanny child and an ambiguous income, thisanswered to nothing in Mrs. Touchett's conception of success. She took,it will be observed, not the sentimental, but the political, view ofmatrimony--a view which has always had much to recommend it. "I trustshe won't have the folly to listen to him," she said to her son; towhich Ralph replied that Isabel's listening was one thing and Isabel'sanswering quite another. He knew she had listened to several parties,as his father would have said, but had made them listen in return; andhe found much entertainment in the idea that in these few months of hisknowing her he should observe a fresh suitor at her gate. She hadwanted to see life, and fortune was serving her to her taste; asuccession of fine gentlemen going down on their knees to her would doas well as anything else. Ralph looked forward to a fourth, a fifth, atenth besieger; he had no conviction she would stop at a third. Shewould keep the gate ajar and open a parley; she would certainly notallow number three to come in. He expressed this view, somewhat afterthis fashion, to his mother, who looked at him as if he had beendancing a jig. He had such a fanciful, pictorial way of saying thingsthat he might as well address her in the deaf-mute's alphabet.</p><p>"I don't think I know what you mean," she said; "you use too manyfigures of speech; I could never understand allegories. The two wordsin the language I most respect are Yes and No. If Isabel wants to marryMr. Osmond she'll do so in spite of all your comparisons. Let her aloneto find a fine one herself for anything she undertakes. I know verylittle about the young man in America; I don't think she spends much ofher time in thinking of him, and I suspect he has got tired of waitingfor her. There's nothing in life to prevent her marrying Mr. Osmond ifshe only looks at him in a certain way. That's all very well; no oneapproves more than I of one's pleasing one's self. But she takes herpleasure in such odd things; she's capable of marrying Mr. Osmond forthe beauty of his opinions or for his autograph of Michael Angelo. Shewants to be disinterested: as if she were the only person who's indanger of not being so! Will HE be so disinterested when he has thespending of her money? That was her idea before your father's death,and it has acquired new charms for her since. She ought to marry someone of whose disinterestedness she shall herself be sure; and therewould be no such proof of that as his having a fortune of his own."</p><p>"My dear mother, I'm not afraid," Ralph answered. "She's makingfools of us all. She'll please herself, of course; but she'll do so bystudying human nature at close quarters and yet retaining her liberty.She has started on an exploring expedition, and I don't think she'llchange her course, at the outset, at a signal from Gilbert Osmond. Shemay have slackened speed for an hour, but before we know it she'll besteaming away again. Excuse another metaphor."</p><p>Mrs. Touchett excused it perhaps, but was not so much reassured asto withhold from Madame Merle the expression of her fears. "You whoknow everything," she said, "you must know this: whether that curiouscreature's really making love to my niece."</p><p>"Gilbert Osmond?" Madame Merle widened her clear eyes and, with afull intelligence, "Heaven help us," she exclaimed, "that's an idea!"</p><p>"Hadn't it occurred to you?"</p><p>"You make me feel an idiot, but I confess it hadn't. I wonder," she added, "if it has occurred to Isabel."</p><p>"Oh, I shall now ask her," said Mrs. Touchett.</p><p>Madame Merle reflected. "Don't put it into her head. The thing would be to ask Mr. Osmond."</p><p>"I can't do that," said Mrs. Touchett. "I won't have him enquire ofme--as he perfectly may with that air of his, given Isabel'ssituation--what business it is of mine."</p><p>"I'll ask him myself," Madame Merle bravely declared.</p><p>"But what business--for HIM--is it of yours?"</p><p>"It's being none whatever is just why I can afford to speak. It's somuch less my business than any one's else that he can put me off withanything he chooses. But it will be by the way he does this that Ishall know."</p><p>"Pray let me hear then," said Mrs. Touchett, "of the fruits of yourpenetration. If I can't speak to him, however, at least I can speak toIsabel."</p><p>Her companion sounded at this the note of warning. "Don't be too quick with her. Don't inflame her imagination."</p><p>"I never did anything in life to any one's imagination. But I'm always sure of her doing something--well, not of MY kind."</p><p>"No, you wouldn't like this," Madame Merle observed without the point of interrogation.</p><p>"Why in the world should I, pray? Mr. Osmond has nothing the least solid to offer."</p><p>Again Madame Merle was silent while her thoughtful smile drew up hermouth even more charmingly than usual toward the left corner. "Let usdistinguish. Gilbert Osmond's certainly not the first comer. He's a manwho in favourable conditions might very well make a great impression.He has made a great impression, to my knowledge, more than once."</p><p>"Don't tell me about his probably quite cold-blooded love-affairs;they're nothing to me!" Mrs. Touchett cried. "What you say's preciselywhy I wish he would cease his visits. He has nothing in the world thatI know of but a dozen or two of early masters and a more or less pertlittle daughter."</p><p>"The early masters are now worth a good deal of money," said MadameMerle, "and the daughter's a very young and very innocent and veryharmless person."</p><p>"In other words she's an insipid little chit. Is that what you mean?Having no fortune she can't hope to marry as they marry here; so thatIsabel will have to furnish her either with a maintenance or with adowry."</p><p>"Isabel probably wouldn't object to being kind to her. I think she likes the poor child."</p><p>"Another reason then for Mr. Osmond's stopping at home! Otherwise, aweek hence, we shall have my niece arriving at the conviction that hermission in life's to prove that a stepmother may sacrifice herself--andthat, to prove it, she must first become one."</p><p>"She would make a charming stepmother," smiled Madame Merle; "but Iquite agree with you that she had better not decide upon her missiontoo hastily. Changing the form of one's mission's almost as difficultas changing the shape of one's nose: there they are, each, in themiddle of one's face and one's character--one has to begin too farback. But I'll investigate and report to you."</p><p>All this went on quite over Isabel's head; she had no suspicionsthat her relations with Mr. Osmond were being discussed. Madame Merlehad said nothing to put her on her guard; she alluded no more pointedlyto him than to the other gentlemen of Florence, native and foreign, whonow arrived in considerable numbers to pay their respects to MissArcher's aunt. Isabel thought him interesting--she came back to that;she liked so to think of him. She had carried away an image from hervisit to his hill-top which her subsequent knowledge of him did nothingto efface and which put on for her a particular harmony with othersupposed and divined things, histories within histories: the image of aquiet, clever, sensitive, distinguished man, strolling on a moss-grownterrace above the sweet Val d'Arno and holding by the hand a littlegirl whose bell-like clearness gave a new grace to childhood. Thepicture had no flourishes, but she liked its lowness of tone and theatmosphere of summer twilight that pervaded it. It spoke of the kind ofpersonal issue that touched her most nearly; of the choice betweenobjects, subjects, contacts--what might she call them?--of a thin andthose of a rich association; of a lonely, studious life in a lovelyland; of an old sorrow that sometimes ached to-day; of a feeling ofpride that was perhaps exaggerated, but that had an element ofnobleness; of a care for beauty and perfection so natural and socultivated together that the career appeared to stretch beneath it inthe disposed vistas and with the ranges of steps and terraces andfountains of a formal Italian garden--allowing only for arid placesfreshened by the natural dews of a quaint half-anxious, half-helplessfatherhood. At Palazzo Crescentini Mr. Osmond's manner remained thesame; diffident at first--oh self-conscious beyond doubt! and full ofthe effort (visible only to a sympathetic eye) to overcome thisdisadvantage; an effort which usually resulted in a great deal of easy,lively, very positive, rather aggressive, always suggestive talk. Mr.Osmond's talk was not injured by the indication of an eagerness toshine; Isabel found no difficulty in believing that a person wassincere who had so many of the signs of strong conviction--as forinstance an explicit and graceful appreciation of anything that mightbe said on his own side of the question, said perhaps by Miss Archer inespecial. What continued to please this young woman was that while hetalked so for amusement he didn't talk, as she had heard people, for"effect." He uttered his ideas as if, odd as they often appeared, hewere used to them and had lived with them; old polished knobs and headsand handles, of precious substance, that could be fitted if necessaryto new walking-sticks--not switches plucked in destitution from thecommon tree and then too elegantly waved about. One day he brought hissmall daughter with him, and she rejoiced to renew acquaintance withthe child, who, as she presented her forehead to be kissed by everymember of the circle, reminded her vividly of an ingenue in a Frenchplay. Isabel had never seen a little person of this pattern; Americangirls were very different-- different too were the maidens of England.Pansy was so formed and finished for her tiny place in the world, andyet in imagination, as one could see, so innocent and infantine. Shesat on the sofa by Isabel; she wore a small grenadine mantle and a pairof the useful gloves that Madame Merle had given her-- little greygloves with a single button. She was like a sheet of blank paper--theideal jeune fille of foreign fiction. Isabel hoped that so fair andsmooth a page would be covered with an edifying text.</p><p>The Countess Gemini also came to call upon her, but the Countess wasquite another affair. She was by no means a blank sheet; she had beenwritten over in a variety of hands, and Mrs. Touchett, who felt by nomeans honoured by her visit, pronounced that a number of unmistakeableblots were to be seen upon her surface. The Countess gave rise indeedto some discussion between the mistress of the house and the visitorfrom Rome, in which Madame Merle (who was not such a fool as toirritate people by always agreeing with them) availed herselffelicitously enough of that large licence of dissent which her hostesspermitted as freely as she practised it. Mrs. Touchett had declared ita piece of audacity that this highly compromised character should havepresented herself at such a time of day at the door of a house in whichshe was esteemed so little as she must long have known herself to be atPalazzo Crescentini. Isabel had been made acquainted with the estimateprevailing under that roof: it represented Mr. Osmond's sister as alady who had so mismanaged her improprieties that they had ceased tohang together at all-- which was at the least what one asked of suchmatters--and had become the mere floating fragments of a wreckedrenown, incommoding social circulation. She had been married by hermother--a more administrative person, with an appreciation of foreigntitles which the daughter, to do her justice, had probably by this timethrown off--to an Italian nobleman who had perhaps given her someexcuse for attempting to quench the consciousness of outrage. TheCountess, however, had consoled herself outrageously, and the list ofher excuses had now lost itself in the labyrinth of her adventures.Mrs. Touchett had never consented to receive her, though the Countesshad made overtures of old. Florence was not an austere city; but, asMrs. Touchett said, she had to draw the line somewhere.</p><p>Madame Merle defended the luckless lady with a great deal of zealand wit. She couldn't see why Mrs. Touchett should make a scapegoat ofa woman who had really done no harm, who had only done good in thewrong way. One must certainly draw the line, but while one was about itone should draw it straight: it was a very crooked chalk-mark thatwould exclude the Countess Gemini. In that case Mrs. Touchett hadbetter shut up her house; this perhaps would be the best course so longas she remained in Florence. One must be fair and not make arbitrarydifferences: the Countess had doubtless been imprudent, she had notbeen so clever as other women. She was a good creature, not clever atall; but since when had that been a ground of exclusion from the bestsociety? For ever so long now one had heard nothing about her, andthere could be no better proof of her having renounced the error of herways than her desire to become a member of Mrs. Touchett's circle.Isabel could contribute nothing to this interesting dispute, not even apatient attention; she contented herself with having given a friendlywelcome to the unfortunate lady, who, whatever her defects, had atleast the merit of being Mr. Osmond's sister. As she liked the brotherIsabel thought it proper to try and like the sister: in spite of thegrowing complexity of things she was still capable of these primitivesequences. She had not received the happiest impression of the Countesson meeting her at the villa, but was thankful for an opportunity torepair the accident. Had not Mr. Osmond remarked that she was arespectable person? To have proceeded from Gilbert Osmond this was acrude proposition, but Madame Merle bestowed upon it a certainimproving polish. She told Isabel more about the poor Countess than Mr.Osmond had done, and related the history of her marriage and itsconsequences. The Count was a member of an ancient Tuscan family, butof such small estate that he had been glad to accept Amy Osmond, inspite of the questionable beauty which had yet not hampered her career,with the modest dowry her mother was able to offer--a sum aboutequivalent to that which had already formed her brother's share oftheir patrimony. Count Gemini since then, however, had inherited money,and now they were well enough off, as Italians went, though Amy washorribly extravagant. The Count was a low-lived brute; he had given hiswife every pretext. She had no children; she had lost three within ayear of their birth. Her mother, who had bristled with pretensions toelegant learning and published descriptive poems and corresponded onItalian subjects with the English weekly journals, her mother had diedthree years after the Countess's marriage, the father, lost in the greyAmerican dawn of the situation, but reputed originally rich and wild,having died much earlier. One could see this in Gilbert Osmond, MadameMerle held--see that he had been brought up by a woman; though, to dohim justice, one would suppose it had been by a more sensible womanthan the American Corinne, as Mrs. Osmond had liked to be called. Shehad brought her children to Italy after her husband's death, and Mrs.Touchett remembered her during the year that followed her arrival. Shethought her a horrible snob; but this was an irregularity of judgementon Mrs. Touchett's part, for she, like Mrs. Osmond, approved ofpolitical marriages. The Countess was very good company and not reallythe featherhead she seemed; all one had to do with her was to observethe simple condition of not believing a word she said. Madame Merle hadalways made the best of her for her brother's sake; he appreciated anykindness shown to Amy, because (if it had to be confessed for him) herather felt she let down their common name. Naturally he couldn't likeher style, her shrillness, her egotism, her violations of taste andabove all of truth: she acted badly on his nerves, she was not HIS sortof woman. What was his sort of woman? Oh, the very opposite of theCountess, a woman to whom the truth should be habitually sacred. Isabelwas unable to estimate the number of times her visitor had, in half anhour, profaned it: the Countess indeed had given her an impression ofrather silly sincerity. She had talked almost exclusively aboutherself; how much she should like to know Miss Archer; how thankful sheshould be for a real friend; how base the people in Florence were; howtired she was of the place; how much she should like to live somewhereelse--in Paris, in London, in Washington; how impossible it was to getanything nice to wear in Italy except a little old lace; how dear theworld was growing everywhere; what a life of suffering and privationshe had led. Madame Merle listened with interest to Isabel's account ofthis passage, but she had not needed it to feel exempt from anxiety. Onthe whole she was not afraid of the Countess, and she could afford todo what was altogether best--not to appear so.</p><p>Isabel had meanwhile another visitor, whom it was not, even behindher back, so easy a matter to patronise. Henrietta Stackpole, who hadleft Paris after Mrs. Touchett's departure for San Remo and had workedher way down, as she said, through the cities of North Italy, reachedthe banks of the Arno about the middle of May. Madame Merle surveyedher with a single glance, took her in from head to foot, and after apang of despair determined to endure her. She determined indeed todelight in her. She mightn't be inhaled as a rose, but she might begrasped as a nettle. Madame Merle genially squeezed her intoinsignificance, and Isabel felt that in foreseeing this liberality shehad done justice to her friend's intelligence. Henrietta's arrival hadbeen announced by Mr. Bantling, who, coming down from Nice while shewas at Venice, and expecting to find her in Florence, which she had notyet reached, called at Palazzo Crescentini to express hisdisappointment. Henrietta's own advent occurred two days later andproduced in Mr. Bantling an emotion amply accounted for by the factthat he had not seen her since the termination of the episode atVersailles. The humorous view of his situation was generally taken, butit was uttered only by Ralph Touchett, who, in the privacy of his ownapartment, when Bantling smoked a cigar there, indulged in goodnessknew what strong comedy on the subject of the all-judging one and herBritish backer. This gentleman took the joke in perfectly good part andcandidly confessed that he regarded the affair as a positiveintellectual adventure. He liked Miss Stackpole extremely; he thoughtshe had a wonderful head on her shoulders, and found great comfort inthe society of a woman who was not perpetually thinking about whatwould be said and how what she did, how what they did--and they haddone things!--would look. Miss Stackpole never cared how anythinglooked, and, if she didn't care, pray why should he? But his curiosityhad been roused; he wanted awfully to see if she ever WOULD care. Hewas prepared to go as far as she--he didn't see why he should breakdown first.</p><p>Henrietta showed no signs of breaking down. Her prospects hadbrightened on her leaving England, and she was now in the fullenjoyment of her copious resources. She had indeed been obliged tosacrifice her hopes with regard to the inner life; the social question,on the Continent, bristled with difficulties even more numerous thanthose she had encountered in England. But on the Continent there wasthe outer life, which was palpable and visible at every turn, and moreeasily convertible to literary uses than the customs of those opaqueislanders. Out of doors in foreign lands, as she ingeniously remarked,one seemed to see the right side of the tapestry; out of doors inEngland one seemed to see the wrong side, which gave one no notion ofthe figure. The admission costs her historian a pang, but Henrietta,despairing of more occult things, was now paying much attention to theouter life. She had been studying it for two months at Venice, fromwhich city she sent to the Interviewer a conscientious account of thegondolas, the Piazza, the Bridge of Sighs, the pigeons and the youngboatman who chanted Tasso. The Interviewer was perhaps disappointed,but Henrietta was at least seeing Europe. Her present purpose was toget down to Rome before the malaria should come on--she apparentlysupposed that it began on a fixed day; and with this design she was tospend at present but few days in Florence. Mr. Bantling was to go withher to Rome, and she pointed out to Isabel that as he had been therebefore, as he was a military man and as he had had a classicaleducation--he had been bred at Eton, where they study nothing but Latinand Whyte-Melville, said Miss Stackpole--he would be a most usefulcompanion in the city of the Caesars. At this juncture Ralph had thehappy idea of proposing to Isabel that she also, under his own escort,should make a pilgrimage to Rome. She expected to pass a portion of thenext winter there--that was very well; but meantime there was no harmin surveying the field. There were ten days left of the beautiful monthof May--the most precious month of all to the true Rome-lover. Isabelwould become a Rome-lover; that was a foregone conclusion. She wasprovided with a trusty companion of her own sex, whose society, thanksto the fact of other calls on this lady's attention, would probably notbe oppressive. Madame Merle would remain with Mrs. Touchett; she hadleft Rome for the summer and wouldn't care to return. She professedherself delighted to be left at peace in Florence; she had locked upher apartment and sent her cook home to Palestrina. She urged Isabel,however, to assent to Ralph's proposal, and assured her that a goodintroduction to Rome was not a thing to be despised. Isabel in truthneeded no urging, and the party of four arranged its little journey.Mrs. Touchett, on this occasion, had resigned herself to the absence ofa duenna; we have seen that she now inclined to the belief that herniece should stand alone. One of Isabel's preparations consisted of herseeing Gilbert Osmond before she started and mentioning her intentionto him.</p><p>"I should like to be in Rome with you," he commented. "I should like to see you on that wonderful ground."</p><p>She scarcely faltered. "You might come then."</p><p>"But you'll have a lot of people with you."</p><p>"Ah," Isabel admitted, "of course I shall not be alone."</p><p>For a moment he said nothing more. "You'll like it," he went on at last. "They've spoiled it, but you'll rave about it."</p><p>"Ought I to dislike it because, poor old dear--the Niobe of Nations, you know--it has been spoiled?" she asked.</p><p>"No, I think not. It has been spoiled so often," he smiled. "If I were to go, what should I do with my little girl?"</p><p>"Can't you leave her at the villa?"</p><p>"I don't know that I like that--though there's a very good old woman who looks after her. I can't afford a governess."</p><p>"Bring her with you then," said Isabel promptly.</p><p>Mr. Osmond looked grave. "She has been in Rome all winter, at her convent; and she's too young to make journeys of pleasure."</p><p>"You don't like bringing her forward?" Isabel enquired.</p><p>"No, I think young girls should be kept out of the world."</p><p>"I was brought up on a different system."</p><p>"You? Oh, with you it succeeded, because you--you were exceptional."</p><p>"I don't see why," said Isabel, who, however, was not sure there was not some truth in the speech.</p><p>Mr. Osmond didn't explain; he simply went on: "If I thought it wouldmake her resemble you to join a social group in Rome I'd take her thereto-morrow."</p><p>"Don't make her resemble me," said Isabel. "Keep her like herself."</p><p>"I might send her to my sister," Mr. Osmond observed. He had almostthe air of asking advice; he seemed to like to talk over his domesticmatters with Miss Archer.</p><p>"Yes," she concurred; "I think that wouldn't do much towards making her resemble me!"</p><p>After she had left Florence Gilbert Osmond met Madame Merle at theCountess Gemini's. There were other people present; the Countess'sdrawing-room was usually well filled, and the talk had been general,but after a while Osmond left his place and came and sat on an ottomanhalf-behind, half-beside Madame Merle's chair. "She wants me to go toRome with her," he remarked in a low voice.</p><p>"To go with her?"</p><p>"To be there while she's there. She proposed it.</p><p>"I suppose you mean that you proposed it and she assented."</p><p>"Of course I gave her a chance. But she's encouraging--she's very encouraging."</p><p>"I rejoice to hear it--but don't cry victory too soon. Of course you'll go to Rome."</p><p>"Ah," said Osmond, "it makes one work, this idea of yours!"</p><p>"Don't pretend you don't enjoy it--you're very ungrateful. You've not been so well occupied these many years."</p><p>"The way you take it's beautiful," said Osmond. "I ought to be grateful for that."</p><p>"Not too much so, however," Madame Merle answered. She talked withher usual smile, leaning back in her chair and looking round the room."You've made a very good impression, and I've seen for myself thatyou've received one. You've not come to Mrs. Touchett's seven times tooblige me."</p><p>"The girl's not disagreeable," Osmond quietly conceded.</p><p>Madame Merle dropped her eye on him a moment, during which her lipsclosed with a certain firmness. "Is that all you can find to say aboutthat fine creature?"</p><p>"All? Isn't it enough? Of how many people have you heard me say more?"</p><p>She made no answer to this, but still presented her talkative graceto the room. "You're unfathomable," she murmured at last. "I'mfrightened at the abyss into which I shall have cast her."</p><p>He took it almost gaily. "You can't draw back--you've gone too far."</p><p>"Very good; but you must do the rest yourself."</p><p>"I shall do it," said Gilbert Osmond.</p><p>Madame Merle remained silent and he changed his place again; butwhen she rose to go he also took leave. Mrs. Touchett's victoria wasawaiting her guest in the court, and after he had helped his friendinto it he stood there detaining her. "You're very indiscreet," shesaid rather wearily; "you shouldn't have moved when I did."</p><p>He had taken off his hat; he passed his hand over his forehead. "I always forget; I'm out of the habit."</p><p>"You're quite unfathomable," she repeated, glancing up at thewindows of the house, a modern structure in the new part of the town.</p><p>He paid no heed to this remark, but spoke in his own sense. "She'sreally very charming. I've scarcely known any one more graceful."</p><p>"It does me good to hear you say that. The better you like her the better for me."</p><p>"I like her very much. She's all you described her, and into thebargain capable, I feel, of great devotion. She has only one fault."</p><p>"What's that?"</p><p>"Too many ideas."</p><p>"I warned you she was clever."</p><p>"Fortunately they're very bad ones," said Osmond.</p><p>"Why is that fortunate?"</p><p>"Dame, if they must be sacrificed!"</p><p>Madame Merle leaned back, looking straight before her; then shespoke to the coachman. But her friend again detained her. "If I go toRome what shall I do with Pansy?"</p><p>"I'll go and see her," said Madame Merle.</p></span><span id = 976 ><p>I may not attempt to report in its fulness our young woman'sresponse to the deep appeal of Rome, to analyse her feelings as shetrod the pavement of the Forum or to number her pulsations as shecrossed the threshold of Saint Peter's. It is enough to say that herimpression was such as might have been expected of a person of herfreshness and her eagerness. She had always been fond of history, andhere was history in the stones of the street and the atoms of thesunshine. She had an imagination that kindled at the mention of greatdeeds, and wherever she turned some great deed had been acted. Thesethings strongly moved her, but moved her all inwardly. It seemed to hercompanions that she talked less than usual, and Ralph Touchett, when heappeared to be looking listlessly and awkwardly over her head, wasreally dropping on her an intensity of observation. By her own measureshe was very happy; she would even have been willing to take thesehours for the happiest she was ever to know. The sense of the terriblehuman past was heavy to her, but that of something altogethercontemporary would suddenly give it wings that it could wave in theblue. Her consciousness was so mixed that she scarcely knew where thedifferent parts of it would lead her, and she went about in a repressedecstasy of contemplation, seeing often in the things she looked at agreat deal more than was there, and yet not seeing many of the itemsenumerated in her Murray. Rome, as Ralph said, confessed to thepsychological moment. The herd of reechoing tourists had departed andmost of the solemn places had relapsed into solemnity. The sky was ablaze of blue, and the plash of the fountains in their mossy niches hadlost its chill and doubled its music. On the corners of the warm,bright streets one stumbled on bundles of flowers. Our friends had goneone afternoon--it was the third of their stay--to look at the latestexcavations in the Forum, these labours having been for some timeprevious largely extended. They had descended from the modern street tothe level of the Sacred Way, along which they wandered with a reverenceof step which was not the same on the part of each. Henrietta Stackpolewas struck with the fact that ancient Rome had been paved a good deallike New York, and even found an analogy between the deep chariot-rutstraceable in the antique street and the overjangled iron grooves whichexpress the intensity of American life. The sun had begun to sink, theair was a golden haze, and the long shadows of broken column and vaguepedestal leaned across the field of ruin. Henrietta wandered away withMr. Bantling, whom it was apparently delightful to her to hear speak ofJulius Caesar as a "cheeky old boy," and Ralph addressed suchelucidations as he was prepared to offer to the attentive ear of ourheroine. One of the humble archeologists who hover about the place hadput himself at the disposal of the two, and repeated his lesson with afluency which the decline of the season had done nothing to impair. Aprocess of digging was on view in a remote corner of the Forum, and hepresently remarked that if it should please the signori to go and watchit a little they might see something of interest. The proposalcommended itself more to Ralph than to Isabel, weary with muchwandering; so that she admonished her companion to satisfy hiscuriosity while she patiently awaited his return. The hour and theplace were much to her taste--she should enjoy being briefly alone.Ralph accordingly went off with the cicerone while Isabel sat down on aprostrate column near the foundations of the Capitol. She wanted ashort solitude, but she was not long to enjoy it. Keen as was herinterest in the rugged relics of the Roman past that lay scatteredabout her and in which the corrosion of centuries had still left somuch of individual life, her thoughts, after resting a while on thesethings, had wandered, by a concatenation of stages it might requiresome subtlety to trace, to regions and objects charged with a moreactive appeal. From the Roman past to Isabel Archer's future was a longstride, but her imagination had taken it in a single flight and nowhovered in slow circles over the nearer and richer field. She was soabsorbed in her thoughts, as she bent her eyes upon a row of crackedbut not dislocated slabs covering the ground at her feet, that she hadnot heard the sound of approaching footsteps before a shadow was thrownacross the line of her vision. She looked up and saw a gentleman--agentleman who was not Ralph come back to say that the excavations werea bore. This personage was startled as she was startled; he stood therebaring his head to her perceptibly pale surprise.</p><p>"Lord Warburton!" Isabel exclaimed as she rose.</p><p>"I had no idea it was you. I turned that corner and came upon you."</p><p>She looked about her to explain. "I'm alone, but my companions havejust left me. My cousin's gone to look at the work over there."</p><p>"Ah yes; I see." And Lord Warburton's eyes wandered vaguely in thedirection she had indicated. He stood firmly before her now; he hadrecovered his balance and seemed to wish to show it, though verykindly. "Don't let me disturb you," he went on, looking at her dejectedpillar. "I'm afraid you're tired."</p><p>"Yes, I'm rather tired." She hesitated a moment, but sat down again. "Don't let me interrupt you," she added.</p><p>"Oh dear, I'm quite alone, I've nothing on earth to do. I had noidea you were in Rome. I've just come from the East. I'm only passingthrough."</p><p>"You've been making a long journey," said Isabel, who had learned from Ralph that Lord Warburton was absent from England.</p><p>"Yes, I came abroad for six months--soon after I saw you last. I'vebeen in Turkey and Asia Minor; I came the other day from Athens." Hemanaged not to be awkward, but he wasn't easy, and after a longer lookat the girl he came down to nature. "Do you wish me to leave you, orwill you let me stay a little?"</p><p>She took it all humanely. "I don't wish you to leave me, Lord Warburton; I'm very glad to see you."</p><p>"Thank you for saying that. May I sit down?"</p><p>The fluted shaft on which she had taken her seat would have affordeda resting-place to several persons, and there was plenty of room evenfor a highly-developed Englishman. This fine specimen of that greatclass seated himself near our young lady, and in the course of fiveminutes he had asked her several questions, taken rather at random andto which, as he put some of them twice over, he apparently somewhatmissed catching the answer; had given her too some information abouthimself which was not wasted upon her calmer feminine sense. Herepeated more than once that he had not expected to meet her, and itwas evident that the encounter touched him in a way that would havemade preparation advisable. He began abruptly to pass from the impunityof things to their solemnity, and from their being delightful to theirbeing impossible. He was splendidly sunburnt; even his multitudinousbeard had been burnished by the fire of Asia. He was dressed in theloose-fitting, heterogeneous garments in which the English traveller inforeign lands is wont to consult his comfort and affirm hisnationality; and with his pleasant steady eyes, his bronzed complexion,fresh beneath its seasoning, his manly figure, his minimising mannerand his general air of being a gentleman and an explorer, he was such arepresentative of the British race as need not in any clime have beendisavowed by those who have a kindness for it. Isabel noted thesethings and was glad she had always liked him. He had kept, evidently inspite of shocks, every one of his merits--properties these partaking ofthe essence of great decent houses, as one might put it; resemblingtheir innermost fixtures and ornaments, not subject to vulgar shiftingand removable only by some whole break-up. They talked of the mattersnaturally in order; her uncle's death, Ralph's state of health, the wayshe had passed her winter, her visit to Rome, her return to Florence,her plans for the summer, the hotel she was staying at; and then ofLord Warburton's own adventures, movements, intentions, impressions andpresent domicile. At last there was a silence, and it said so much morethan either had said that it scarce needed his final words. "I'vewritten to you several times."</p><p>"Written to me? I've never had your letters."</p><p>"I never sent them. I burned them up."</p><p>"Ah," laughed Isabel, "it was better that you should do that than I!"</p><p>"I thought you wouldn't care for them," he went on with a simplicitythat touched her. "It seemed to me that after all I had no right totrouble you with letters."</p><p>"I should have been very glad to have news of you. You know how Ihoped that--that--" But she stopped; there would be such a flatness inthe utterance of her thought.</p><p>"I know what you're going to say. You hoped we should always remaingood friends." This formula, as Lord Warburton uttered it, wascertainly flat enough; but then he was interested in making it appearso.</p><p>She found herself reduced simply to "Please don't talk of all that";a speech which hardly struck her as improvement on the other.</p><p>"It's a small consolation to allow me!" her companion exclaimed with force.</p><p>"I can't pretend to console you," said the girl, who, all still asshe sat there, threw herself back with a sort of inward triumph on theanswer that had satisfied him so little six months before. He waspleasant, he was powerful, he was gallant; there was no better man thanhe. But her answer remained.</p><p>"It's very well you don't try to console me; it wouldn't be in yourpower," she heard him say through the medium of her strange elation.</p><p>"I hoped we should meet again, because I had no fear you wouldattempt to make me feel I had wronged you. But when you do that-- thepain's greater than the pleasure." And she got up with a smallconscious majesty, looking for her companions.</p><p>"I don't want to make you feel that; of course I can't say that. Ionly just want you to know one or two things--in fairness to myself, asit were. I won't return to the subject again. I felt very strongly whatI expressed to you last year; I couldn't think of anything else. Itried to forget--energetically, systematically. I tried to take aninterest in somebody else. I tell you this because I want you to know Idid my duty. I didn't succeed. It was for the same purpose I wentabroad--as far away as possible. They say travelling distracts themind, but it didn't distract mine. I've thought of you perpetually,ever since I last saw you. I'm exactly the same. I love you just asmuch, and everything I said to you then is just as true. This instantat which I speak to you shows me again exactly how, to my greatmisfortune, you just insuperably charm me. There--I can't say less. Idon't mean, however, to insist; it's only for a moment. I may add thatwhen I came upon you a few minutes since, without the smallest idea ofseeing you, I was, upon my honour, in the very act of wishing I knewwhere you were." He had recovered his self-control, and while he spokeit became complete. He might have been addressing a smallcommittee--making all quietly and clearly a statement of importance;aided by an occasional look at a paper of notes concealed in his hat,which he had not again put on. And the committee, assuredly, would havefelt the point proved.</p><p>"I've often thought of you, Lord Warburton," Isabel answered. "Youmay be sure I shall always do that." And she added in a tone of whichshe tried to keep up the kindness and keep down the meaning: "There'sno harm in that on either side."</p><p>They walked along together, and she was prompt to ask about hissisters and request him to let them know she had done so. He made forthe moment no further reference to their great question, but dippedagain into shallower and safer waters. But he wished to know when shewas to leave Rome, and on her mentioning the limit of her stay declaredhe was glad it was still so distant.</p><p>"Why do you say that if you yourself are only passing through?" she enquired with some anxiety.</p><p>"Ah, when I said I was passing through I didn't mean that one wouldtreat Rome as if it were Clapham Junction. To pass through Rome is tostop a week or two."</p><p>"Say frankly that you mean to stay as long as I do!"</p><p>His flushed smile, for a little, seemed to sound her. "You won't like that. You're afraid you'll see too much of me."</p><p>"It doesn't matter what I like. I certainly can't expect you toleave this delightful place on my account. But I confess I'm afraid ofyou."</p><p>"Afraid I'll begin again? I promise to be very careful."</p><p>They had gradually stopped and they stood a moment face to face."Poor Lord Warburton!" she said with a compassion intended to be goodfor both of them.</p><p>"Poor Lord Warburton indeed! But I'll be careful."</p><p>"You may be unhappy, but you shall not make ME so. That I can't allow."</p><p>"If I believed I could make you unhappy I think I should try it." Atthis she walked in advance and he also proceeded. "I'll never say aword to displease you."</p><p>"Very good. If you do, our friendship's at an end."</p><p>"Perhaps some day--after a while--you'll give me leave."</p><p>"Give you leave to make me unhappy?"</p><p>He hesitated. "To tell you again--" But he checked himself. "I'll keep it down. I'll keep it down always."</p><p>Ralph Touchett had been joined in his visit to the excavation byMiss Stackpole and her attendant, and these three now emerged fromamong the mounds of earth and stone collected round the aperture andcame into sight of Isabel and her companion. Poor Ralph hailed hisfriend with joy qualified by wonder, and Henrietta exclaimed in a highvoice "Gracious, there's that lord!" Ralph and his English neighbourgreeted with the austerity with which, after long separations, Englishneighbours greet, and Miss Stackpole rested her large intellectual gazeupon the sunburnt traveller. But she soon established her relation tothe crisis. "I don't suppose you remember me, sir."</p><p>"Indeed I do remember you," said Lord Warburton. "I asked you to come and see me, and you never came."</p><p>"I don't go everywhere I'm asked," Miss Stackpole answered coldly.</p><p>"Ah well, I won't ask you again," laughed the master of Lockleigh.</p><p>"If you do I'll go; so be sure!"</p><p>Lord Warburton, for all his hilarity, seemed sure enough. Mr.Bantling had stood by without claiming a recognition, but he now tookoccasion to nod to his lordship, who answered him with a friendly "Oh,you here, Bantling?" and a hand-shake.</p><p>"Well," said Henrietta, "I didn't know you knew him!"</p><p>"I guess you don't know every one I know," Mr. Bantling rejoined facetiously.</p><p>"I thought that when an Englishman knew a lord he always told you."</p><p>"Ah, I'm afraid Bantling was ashamed of me," Lord Warburton laughedagain. Isabel took pleasure in that note; she gave a small sigh ofrelief as they kept their course homeward.</p><p>The next day was Sunday; she spent her morning over two longletters--one to her sister Lily, the other to Madame Merle; but inneither of these epistles did she mention the fact that a rejectedsuitor had threatened her with another appeal. Of a Sunday afternoonall good Romans (and the best Romans are often the northern barbarians)follow the custom of going to vespers at Saint Peter's; and it had beenagreed among our friends that they would drive together to the greatchurch. After lunch, an hour before the carriage came, Lord Warburtonpresented himself at the Hotel de Paris and paid a visit to the twoladies, Ralph Touchett and Mr. Bantling having gone out together. Thevisitor seemed to have wished to give Isabel a proof of his intentionto keep the promise made her the evening before; he was both discreetand frank--not even dumbly importunate or remotely intense. He thusleft her to judge what a mere good friend he could be. He talked abouthis travels, about Persia, about Turkey, and when Miss Stackpole askedhim whether it would "pay" for her to visit those countries assured herthey offered a great field to female enterprise. Isabel did himjustice, but she wondered what his purpose was and what he expected togain even by proving the superior strain of his sincerity. If heexpected to melt her by showing what a good fellow he was, he mightspare himself the trouble. She knew the superior strain of everythingabout him, and nothing he could now do was required to light the view.Moreover his being in Rome at all affected her as a complication of thewrong sort--she liked so complications of the right. Nevertheless,when, on bringing his call to a close, he said he too should be atSaint Peter's and should look out for her and her friends, she wasobliged to reply that he must follow his convenience.</p><p>In the church, as she strolled over its tesselated acres, he was thefirst person she encountered. She had not been one of the superiortourists who are "disappointed" in Saint Peter's and find it smallerthan its fame; the first time she passed beneath the huge leatherncurtain that strains and bangs at the entrance, the first time shefound herself beneath the far-arching dome and saw the light drizzledown through the air thickened with incense and with the reflections ofmarble and gilt, of mosaic and bronze, her conception of greatness roseand dizzily rose. After this it never lacked space to soar. She gazedand wondered like a child or a peasant, she paid her silent tribute tothe seated sublime. Lord Warburton walked beside her and talked ofSaint Sophia of Constantinople; she feared for instance that he wouldend by calling attention to his exemplary conduct. The service had notyet begun, but at Saint Peter's there is much to observe, and as thereis something almost profane in the vastness of the place, which seemsmeant as much for physical as for spiritual exercise, the differentfigures and groups, the mingled worshippers and spectators, may followtheir various intentions without conflict or scandal. In that splendidimmensity individual indiscretion carries but a short distance. Isabeland her companions, however, were guilty of none; for though Henriettawas obliged in candour to declare that Michael Angelo's dome sufferedby comparison with that of the Capitol at Washington, she addressed herprotest chiefly to Mr. Bantling's ear and reserved it in its moreaccentuated form for the columns of the Interviewer. Isabel made thecircuit of the church with his lordship, and as they drew near thechoir on the left of the entrance the voices of the Pope's singers wereborne to them over the heads of the large number of persons clusteredoutside the doors. They paused a while on the skirts of this crowd,composed in equal measure of Roman cockneys and inquisitive strangers,and while they stood there the sacred concert went forward. Ralph, withHenrietta and Mr. Bantling, was apparently within, where Isabel,looking beyond the dense group in front of her, saw the afternoonlight, silvered by clouds of incense that seemed to mingle with thesplendid chant, slope through the embossed recesses of high windows.After a while the singing stopped and then Lord Warburton seemeddisposed to move off with her. Isabel could only accompany him;whereupon she found herself confronted with Gilbert Osmond, whoappeared to have been standing at a short distance behind her. He nowapproached with all the forms --he appeared to have multiplied them onthis occasion to suit the place.</p><p>"So you decided to come?" she said as she put out her hand.</p><p>"Yes, I came last night and called this afternoon at your hotel. They told me you had come here, and I looked about for you."</p><p>"The others are inside," she decided to say.</p><p>"I didn't come for the others," he promptly returned.</p><p>She looked away; Lord Warburton was watching them; perhaps he hadheard this. Suddenly she remembered it to be just what he had said toher the morning he came to Gardencourt to ask her to marry him. Mr.Osmond's words had brought the colour to her cheek, and thisreminiscence had not the effect of dispelling it. She repaired anybetrayal by mentioning to each companion the name of the other, andfortunately at this moment Mr. Bantling emerged from the choir,cleaving the crowd with British valour and followed by Miss Stackpoleand Ralph Touchett. I say fortunately, but this is perhaps asuperficial view of the matter; since on perceiving the gentleman fromFlorence Ralph Touchett appeared to take the case as not committing himto joy. He didn't hang back, however, from civility, and presentlyobserved to Isabel, with due benevolence, that she would soon have allher friends about her. Miss Stackpole had met Mr. Osmond in Florence,but she had already found occasion to say to Isabel that she liked himno better than her other admirers--than Mr. Touchett and LordWarburton, and even than little Mr. Rosier in Paris. "I don't know whatit's in you," she had been pleased to remark, "but for a nice girl youdo attract the most unnatural people. Mr. Goodwood's the only one I'veany respect for, and he's just the one you don't appreciate."</p><p>"What's your opinion of Saint Peter's?" Mr. Osmond was meanwhile enquiring of our young lady.</p><p>"It's very large and very bright," she contented herself with replying.</p><p>"It's too large; it makes one feel like an atom."</p><p>"Isn't that the right way to feel in the greatest of human temples?" she asked with rather a liking for her phrase.</p><p>"I suppose it's the right way to feel everywhere, when one IS nobody. But I like it in a church as little as anywhere else."</p><p>"You ought indeed to be a Pope!" Isabel exclaimed, remembering something he had referred to in Florence.</p><p>"Ah, I should have enjoyed that!" said Gilbert Osmond.</p><p>Lord Warburton meanwhile had joined Ralph Touchett, and the twostrolled away together. "Who's the fellow speaking to Miss Archer?" hislordship demanded.</p><p>"His name's Gilbert Osmond--he lives in Florence," Ralph said.</p><p>"What is he besides?"</p><p>"Nothing at all. Oh yes, he's an American; but one forgets that-- he's so little of one."</p><p>"Has he known Miss Archer long?"</p><p>"Three or four weeks."</p><p>"Does she like him?"</p><p>"She's trying to find out."</p><p>"And will she?"</p><p>"Find out--?" Ralph asked.</p><p>"Will she like him?"</p><p>"Do you mean will she accept him?"</p><p>"Yes," said Lord Warburton after an instant; "I suppose that's what I horribly mean."</p><p>"Perhaps not if one does nothing to prevent it," Ralph replied.</p><p>His lordship stared a moment, but apprehended. "Then we must be perfectly quiet?"</p><p>"As quiet as the grave. And only on the chance!" Ralph added.</p><p>"The chance she may?"</p><p>"The chance she may not?"</p><p>Lord Warburton took this at first in silence, but he spoke again. "Is he awfully clever?"</p><p>"Awfully," said Ralph.</p><p>His companion thought. "And what else?"</p><p>"What more do you want?" Ralph groaned.</p><p>"Do you mean what more does SHE?"</p><p>Ralph took him by the arm to turn him: they had to rejoin the others. "She wants nothing that WE can give her."</p><p>"Ah well, if she won't have You--!" said his lordship handsomely as they went.</p></span><span id = 977 ><p>On the morrow, in the evening, Lord Warburton went again to see hisfriends at their hotel, and at this establishment he learned that theyhad gone to the opera. He drove to the opera with the idea of payingthem a visit in their box after the easy Italian fashion; and when hehad obtained his admittance--it was one of the secondarytheatres--looked about the large, bare, ill-lighted house. An act hadjust terminated and he was at liberty to pursue his quest. Afterscanning two or three tiers of boxes he perceived in one of the largestof these receptacles a lady whom he easily recognised. Miss Archer wasseated facing the stage and partly screened by the curtain of the box;and beside her, leaning back in his chair, was Mr. Gilbert Osmond. Theyappeared to have the place to themselves, and Warburton supposed theircompanions had taken advantage of the recess to enjoy the relativecoolness of the lobby. He stood a while with his eyes on theinteresting pair; he asked himself if he should go up and interrupt theharmony. At last he judged that Isabel had seen him, and this accidentdetermined him. There should be no marked holding off. He took his wayto the upper regions and on the staircase met Ralph Touchett slowlydescending, his hat at the inclination of ennui and his hands wherethey usually were.</p><p>"I saw you below a moment since and was going down to you. I feel lonely and want company," was Ralph's greeting.</p><p>"You've some that's very good which you've yet deserted."</p><p>"Do you mean my cousin? Oh, she has a visitor and doesn't want me.Then Miss Stackpole and Bantling have gone out to a cafe to eat anice--Miss Stackpole delights in an ice. I didn't think they wanted meeither. The opera's very bad; the women look like laundresses and singlike peacocks. I feel very low."</p><p>"You had better go home," Lord Warburton said without affectation.</p><p>"And leave my young lady in this sad place? Ah no, I must watch over her."</p><p>"She seems to have plenty of friends."</p><p>"Yes, that's why I must watch," said Ralph with the same large mock-melancholy.</p><p>"If she doesn't want you it's probable she doesn't want me."</p><p>"No, you're different. Go to the box and stay there while I walk about."</p><p>Lord Warburton went to the box, where Isabel's welcome was as to afriend so honourably old that he vaguely asked himself what queertemporal province she was annexing. He exchanged greetings with Mr.Osmond, to whom he had been introduced the day before and who, after hecame in, sat blandly apart and silent, as if repudiating competence inthe subjects of allusion now probable. It struck her second visitorthat Miss Archer had, in operatic conditions, a radiance, even a slightexaltation; as she was, however, at all times a keenly-glancing,quickly-moving, completely animated young woman, he may have beenmistaken on this point. Her talk with him moreover pointed to presenceof mind; it expressed a kindness so ingenious and deliberate as toindicate that she was in undisturbed possession of her faculties. PoorLord Warburton had moments of bewilderment. She had discouraged him,formally, as much as a woman could; what business had she then withsuch arts and such felicities, above all with such tones ofreparation--preparation? Her voice had tricks of sweetness, but whyplay them on HIM? The others came back; the bare, familiar, trivialopera began again. The box was large, and there was room for him toremain if he would sit a little behind and in the dark. He did so forhalf an hour, while Mr. Osmond remained in front, leaning forward, hiselbows on his knees, just behind Isabel. Lord Warburton heard nothing,and from his gloomy corner saw nothing but the clear profile of thisyoung lady defined against the dim illumination of the house. Whenthere was another interval no one moved. Mr. Osmond talked to Isabel,and Lord Warburton kept his corner. He did so but for a short time,however; after which he got up and bade good-night to the ladies.Isabel said nothing to detain him, but it didn't prevent his beingpuzzled again. Why should she mark so one of his values--quite thewrong one--when she would have nothing to do with another, which wasquite the right? He was angry with himself for being puzzled, and thenangry for being angry. Verdi's music did little to comfort him, and heleft the theatre and walked homeward, without knowing his way, throughthe tortuous, tragic streets of Rome, where heavier sorrows than hishad been carried under the stars.</p><p>"What's the character of that gentleman?" Osmond asked of Isabel after he had retired.</p><p>"Irreproachable--don't you see it?"</p><p>"He owns about half England; that's his character," Henrietta remarked. "That's what they call a free country!"</p><p>"Ah, he's a great proprietor? Happy man!" said Gilbert Osmond.</p><p>"Do you call that happiness--the ownership of wretched humanbeings?" cried Miss Stackpole. "He owns his tenants and has thousandsof them. It's pleasant to own something, but inanimate objects areenough for me. I don't insist on flesh and blood and minds andconsciences."</p><p>"It seems to me you own a human being or two," Mr. Bantlingsuggested jocosely. "I wonder if Warburton orders his tenants about asyou do me."</p><p>"Lord Warburton's a great radical," Isabel said. "He has very advanced opinions."</p><p>"He has very advanced stone walls. His park's enclosed by a giganticiron fence, some thirty miles round," Henrietta announced for theinformation of Mr. Osmond. "I should like him to converse with a few ofour Boston radicals."</p><p>"Don't they approve of iron fences?" asked Mr. Bantling.</p><p>"Only to shut up wicked conservatives. I always feel as if I weretalking to YOU over something with a neat top-finish of broken glass."</p><p>"Do you know him well, this unreformed reformer?" Osmond went on, questioning Isabel.</p><p>"Well enough for all the use I have for him."</p><p>"And how much of a use is that?"</p><p>"Well, I like to like him."</p><p>"'Liking to like'--why, it makes a passion!" said Osmond.</p><p>"No"--she considered--"keep that for liking to DISlike."</p><p>"Do you wish to provoke me then," Osmond laughed, "to a passion for HIM?"</p><p>She said nothing for a moment, but then met the light question witha disproportionate gravity. "No, Mr. Osmond; I don't think I shouldever dare to provoke you. Lord Warburton, at any rate," she more easilyadded, "is a very nice man."</p><p>"Of great ability?" her friend enquired.</p><p>"Of excellent ability, and as good as he looks."</p><p>"As good as he's good-looking do you mean? He's very good-looking.How detestably fortunate!--to be a great English magnate, to be cleverand handsome into the bargain, and, by way of finishing off, to enjoyyour high favour! That's a man I could envy."</p><p>Isabel considered him with interest. "You seem to me to be alwaysenvying some one. Yesterday it was the Pope; to-day it's poor LordWarburton."</p><p>"My envy's not dangerous; it wouldn't hurt a mouse. I don't want todestroy the people--I only want to BE them. You see it would destroyonly myself."</p><p>"You'd like to be the Pope?" said Isabel.</p><p>"I should love it--but I should have gone in for it earlier. But why"--Osmond reverted--"do you speak of your friend as poor?"</p><p>"Women--when they are very, very good sometimes pity men afterthey've hurt them; that's their great way of showing kindness," saidRalph, joining in the conversation for the first time and with acynicism so transparently ingenious as to be virtually innocent.</p><p>"Pray, have I hurt Lord Warburton?" Isabel asked, raising her eyebrows as if the idea were perfectly fresh.</p><p>"It serves him right if you have," said Henrietta while the curtain rose for the ballet.</p><p>Isabel saw no more of her attributive victim for the nexttwenty-four hours, but on the second day after the visit to the operashe encountered him in the gallery of the Capitol, where he stoodbefore the lion of the collection, the statue of the Dying Gladiator.She had come in with her companions, among whom, on this occasionagain, Gilbert Osmond had his place, and the party, having ascended thestaircase, entered the first and finest of the rooms. Lord Warburtonaddressed her alertly enough, but said in a moment that he was leavingthe gallery. "And I'm leaving Rome," he added. "I must bid yougoodbye." Isabel, inconsequently enough, was now sorry to hear it. Thiswas perhaps because she had ceased to be afraid of his renewing hissuit; she was thinking of something else. She was on the point ofnaming her regret, but she checked herself and simply wished him ahappy journey; which made him look at her rather unlightedly. "I'mafraid you'll think me very 'volatile.' I told you the other day Iwanted so much to stop."</p><p>"Oh no; you could easily change your mind."</p><p>"That's what I have done."</p><p>"Bon voyage then."</p><p>"You're in a great hurry to get rid of me," said his lordship quite dismally.</p><p>"Not in the least. But I hate partings."</p><p>"You don't care what I do," he went on pitifully.</p><p>Isabel looked at him a moment. "Ah," she said, "you're not keeping your promise!"</p><p>He coloured like a boy of fifteen. "If I'm not, then it's because I can't; and that's why I'm going."</p><p>"Good-bye then."</p><p>"Good-bye." He lingered still, however. "When shall I see you again?"</p><p>Isabel hesitated, but soon, as if she had had a happy inspiration: "Some day after you're married."</p><p>"That will never be. It will be after you are."</p><p>"That will do as well," she smiled.</p><p>"Yes, quite as well. Good-bye."</p><p>They shook hands, and he left her alone in the glorious room, amongthe shining antique marbles. She sat down in the centre of the circleof these presences, regarding them vaguely, resting her eyes on theirbeautiful blank faces; listening, as it were, to their eternal silence.It is impossible, in Rome at least, to look long at a great company ofGreek sculptures without feeling the effect of their noble quietude;which, as with a high door closed for the ceremony, slowly drops on thespirit the large white mantle of peace. I say in Rome especially,because the Roman air is an exquisite medium for such impressions. Thegolden sunshine mingles with them, the deep stillness of the past, sovivid yet, though it is nothing but a void full of names, seems tothrow a solemn spell upon them. The blinds were partly closed in thewindows of the Capitol, and a clear, warm shadow rested on the figuresand made them more mildly human. Isabel sat there a long time, underthe charm of their motionless grace, wondering to what, of theirexperience, their absent eyes were open, and how, to our ears, theiralien lips would sound. The dark red walls of the room threw them intorelief; the polished marble floor reflected their beauty. She had seenthem all before, but her enjoyment repeated itself, and it was all thegreater because she was glad again, for the time, to be alone. At last,however, her attention lapsed, drawn off by a deeper tide of life. Anoccasional tourist came in, stopped and stared a moment at the DyingGladiator, and then passed out of the other door, creaking over thesmooth pavement. At the end of half an hour Gilbert Osmond reappeared,apparently in advance of his companions. He strolled toward her slowly,with his hands behind him and his usual enquiring, yet not quiteappealing smile. "I'm surprised to find you alone, I thought you hadcompany.</p><p>"So I have--the best." And she glanced at the Antinous and the Faun.</p><p>"Do you call them better company than an English peer?"</p><p>"Ah, my English peer left me some time ago." She got up, speaking with intention a little dryly.</p><p>Mr. Osmond noted her dryness, which contributed for him to theinterest of his question. "I'm afraid that what I heard the otherevening is true: you're rather cruel to that nobleman."</p><p>Isabel looked a moment at the vanquished Gladiator. "It's not true. I'm scrupulously kind."</p><p>"That's exactly what I mean!" Gilbert Osmond returned, and with suchhappy hilarity that his joke needs to be explained. We know that he wasfond of originals, of rarities, of the superior and the exquisite; andnow that he had seen Lord Warburton, whom he thought a very fineexample of his race and order, he perceived a new attraction in theidea of taking to himself a young lady who had qualified herself tofigure in his collection of choice objects by declining so noble ahand. Gilbert Osmond had a high appreciation of this particularpatriciate; not so much for its distinction, which he thought easilysurpassable, as for its solid actuality. He had never forgiven his starfor not appointing him to an English dukedom, and he could measure theunexpectedness of such conduct as Isabel's. It would be proper that thewoman he might marry should have done something of that sort.</p></span><span id = 978 ><p>Ralph Touchett, in talk with his excellent friend, had rathermarkedly qualified, as we know, his recognition of Gilbert Osmond'spersonal merits; but he might really have felt himself illiberal in thelight of that gentleman's conduct during the rest of the visit to Rome.Osmond spent a portion of each day with Isabel and her companions, andended by affecting them as the easiest of men to live with. Whowouldn't have seen that he could command, as it were, both tact andgaiety?--which perhaps was exactly why Ralph had made his old-time lookof superficial sociability a reproach to him. Even Isabel's invidiouskinsman was obliged to admit that he was just now a delightfulassociate. His good humour was imperturbable, his knowledge of theright fact, his production of the right word, as convenient as thefriendly flicker of a match for your cigarette. Clearly he wasamused--as amused as a man could be who was so little ever surprised,and that made him almost applausive. It was not that his spirits werevisibly high--he would never, in the concert of pleasure, touch the bigdrum by so much as a knuckle: he had a mortal dislike to the high,ragged note, to what he called random ravings. He thought Miss Archersometimes of too precipitate a readiness. It was pity she had thatfault, because if she had not had it she would really have had none;she would have been as smooth to his general need of her as handledivory to the palm. If he was not personally loud, however, he was deep,and during these closing days of the Roman May he knew a complacencythat matched with slow irregular walks under the pines of the VillaBorghese, among the small sweet meadow-flowers and the mossy marbles.He was pleased with everything; he had never before been pleased withso many things at once. Old impressions, old enjoyments, renewedthemselves; one evening, going home to his room at the inn, he wrotedown a little sonnet to which he prefixed the title of "RomeRevisited." A day or two later he showed this piece of correct andingenious verse to Isabel, explaining to her that it was an Italianfashion to commemorate the occasions of life by a tribute to the muse.</p><p>He took his pleasures in general singly; he was too often--he wouldhave admitted that--too sorely aware of something wrong, somethingugly; the fertilising dew of a conceivable felicity too seldomdescended on his spirit. But at present he was happy-- happier than hehad perhaps ever been in his life, and the feeling had a largefoundation. This was simply the sense of success--the most agreeableemotion of the human heart. Osmond had never had too much of it; inthis respect he had the irritation of satiety, as he knew perfectlywell and often reminded himself. "Ah no, I've not been spoiled;certainly I've not been spoiled," he used inwardly to repeat. "If I dosucceed before I die I shall thoroughly have earned it." He was too aptto reason as if "earning" this boon consisted above all of covertlyaching for it and might be confined to that exercise. Absolutely voidof it, also, his career had not been; he might indeed have suggested toa spectator here and there that he was resting on vague laurels. Buthis triumphs were, some of them, now too old; others had been too easy.The present one had been less arduous than might have been expected,but had been easy-- that is had been rapid--only because he had made analtogether exceptional effort, a greater effort than he had believed itin him to make. The desire to have something or other to show for his"parts"--to show somehow or other--had been the dream of his youth; butas the years went on the conditions attached to any marked proof ofrarity had affected him more and more as gross and detestable; like theswallowing of mugs of beer to advertise what one could "stand." If ananonymous drawing on a museum wall had been conscious and watchful itmight have known this peculiar pleasure of being at last and all of asudden identified--as from the hand of a great master--by the so highand so unnoticed fact of style. His "style" was what the girl haddiscovered with a little help; and now, beside herself enjoying it, sheshould publish it to the world without his having any of the trouble.She should do the thing FOR him, and he would not have waited in vain.</p><p>Shortly before the time fixed in advance for her departure thisyoung lady received from Mrs. Touchett a telegram running as follows:"Leave Florence 4th June for Bellaggio, and take you if you have notother views. But can't wait if you dawdle in Rome." The dawdling inRome was very pleasant, but Isabel had different views, and she let heraunt know she would immediately join her. She told Gilbert Osmond thatshe had done so, and he replied that, spending many of his summers aswell as his winters in Italy, he himself would loiter a little longerin the cool shadow of Saint Peter's. He would not return to Florencefor ten days more, and in that time she would have started forBellaggio. It might be months in this case before he should see heragain. This exchange took place in the large decorated sitting-roomoccupied by our friends at the hotel; it was late in the evening, andRalph Touchett was to take his cousin back to Florence on the morrow.Osmond had found the girl alone; Miss Stackpole had contracted afriendship with a delightful American family on the fourth floor andhad mounted the interminable staircase to pay them a visit. Henriettacontracted friendships, in travelling, with great freedom, and hadformed in railway-carriages several that were among her most valuedties. Ralph was making arrangements for the morrow's journey, andIsabel sat alone in a wilderness of yellow upholstery. The chairs andsofas were orange; the walls and windows were draped in purple andgilt. The mirrors, the pictures had great flamboyant frames; theceiling was deeply vaulted and painted over with naked muses andcherubs. For Osmond the place was ugly to distress; the false colours,the sham splendour were like vulgar, bragging, lying talk. Isabel hadtaken in hand a volume of Ampere, presented, on their arrival in Rome,by Ralph; but though she held it in her lap with her finger vaguelykept in the place she was not impatient to pursue her study. A lampcovered with a drooping veil of pink tissue-paper burned on the tablebeside her and diffused a strange pale rosiness over the scene.</p><p>"You say you'll come back; but who knows?" Gilbert Osmond said.</p><p>"I think you're much more likely to start on your voyage round theworld. You're under no obligation to come back; you can do exactly whatyou choose; you can roam through space."</p><p>"Well, Italy's a part of space," Isabel answered. "I can take it on the way."</p><p>"On the way round the world? No, don't do that. Don't put us in aparenthesis--give us a chapter to ourselves. I don't want to see you onyour travels. I'd rather see you when they're over. I should like tosee you when you're tired and satiated," Osmond added in a moment. "Ishall prefer you in that state."</p><p>Isabel, with her eyes bent, fingered the pages of M. Ampere. "Youturn things into ridicule without seeming to do it, though not, Ithink, without intending it. You've no respect for my travels-- youthink them ridiculous."</p><p>"Where do you find that?"</p><p>She went on in the same tone, fretting the edge of her book with thepaper-knife. "You see my ignorance, my blunders, the way I wander aboutas if the world belonged to me, simply because-- because it has beenput into my power to do so. You don't think a woman ought to do that.You think it bold and ungraceful."</p><p>"I think it beautiful," said Osmond. "You know my opinions--I'vetreated you to enough of them. Don't you remember my telling you thatone ought to make one's life a work of art? You looked rather shockedat first; but then I told you that it was exactly what you seemed to meto be trying to do with your own."</p><p>She looked up from her book. "What you despise most in the world is bad, is stupid art."</p><p>"Possibly. But yours seem to me very clear and very good."</p><p>"If I were to go to Japan next winter you would laugh at me," she went on.</p><p>Osmond gave a smile--a keen one, but not a laugh, for the tone oftheir conversation was not jocose. Isabel had in fact her solemnity; hehad seen it before. "You have one!"</p><p>"That's exactly what I say. You think such an idea absurd."</p><p>"I would give my little finger to go to Japan; it's one of thecountries I want most to see. Can't you believe that, with my taste forold lacquer?"</p><p>"I haven't a taste for old lacquer to excuse me," said Isabel.</p><p>"You've a better excuse--the means of going. You're quite wrong inyour theory that I laugh at you. I don't know what has put it into yourhead."</p><p>"It wouldn't be remarkable if you did think it ridiculous that Ishould have the means to travel when you've not; for you knoweverything and I know nothing."</p><p>"The more reason why you should travel and learn," smiled Osmond."Besides," he added as if it were a point to be made, "I don't knoweverything."</p><p>Isabel was not struck with the oddity of his saying this gravely;she was thinking that the pleasantest incident of her life--so itpleased her to qualify these too few days in Rome, which she mightmusingly have likened to the figure of some small princess of one ofthe ages of dress overmuffled in a mantle of state and dragging a trainthat it took pages or historians to hold up-- that this felicity wascoming to an end. That most of the interest of the time had been owingto Mr. Osmond was a reflexion she was not just now at pains to make;she had already done the point abundant justice. But she said toherself that if there were a danger they should never meet again,perhaps after all it would be as well. Happy things don't repeatthemselves, and her adventure wore already the changed, the seawardface of some romantic island from which, after feasting on purplegrapes, she was putting off while the breeze rose. She might come backto Italy and find him different--this strange man who pleased her justas he was; and it would be better not to come than run the risk ofthat. But if she was not to come the greater the pity that the chapterwas closed; she felt for a moment a pang that touched the source oftears. The sensation kept her silent, and Gilbert Osmond was silenttoo; he was looking at her. "Go everywhere," he said at last, in a low,kind voice; "do everything; get everything out of life. Be happy,--betriumphant."</p><p>"What do you mean by being triumphant?"</p><p>"Well, doing what you like."</p><p>"To triumph, then, it seems to me, is to fail! Doing all the vain things one likes is often very tiresome."</p><p>"Exactly," said Osmond with his quiet quickness. "As I intimatedjust now, you'll be tired some day." He paused a moment and then hewent on: "I don't know whether I had better not wait till then forsomething I want to say to you."</p><p>"Ah, I can't advise you without knowing what it is. But I'm horrid when I'm tired," Isabel added with due inconsequence.</p><p>"I don't believe that. You're angry, sometimes--that I can believe,though I've never seen it. But I'm sure you're never 'cross.'"</p><p>"Not even when I lose my temper?"</p><p>"You don't lose it--you find it, and that must be beautiful." Osmondspoke with a noble earnestness. "They must be great moments to see."</p><p>"If I could only find it now!" Isabel nervously cried.</p><p>"I'm not afraid; I should fold my arms and admire you. I'm speakingvery seriously." He leaned forward, a hand on each knee; for somemoments he bent his eyes on the floor. "What I wish to say to you," hewent on at last, looking up, "is that I find I'm in love with you."</p><p>She instantly rose. "Ah, keep that till I am tired!"</p><p>"Tired of hearing it from others?" He sat there raising his eyes toher. "No, you may heed it now or never, as you please. But after all Imust say it now." She had turned away, but in the movement she hadstopped herself and dropped her gaze upon him. The two remained a whilein this situation, exchanging a long look --the large, conscious lookof the critical hours of life. Then he got up and came near her, deeplyrespectful, as if he were afraid he had been too familiar. "I'mabsolutely in love with you."</p><p>He had repeated the announcement in a tone of almost impersonaldiscretion, like a man who expected very little from it but who spokefor his own needed relief. The tears came into her eyes: this time theyobeyed the sharpness of the pang that suggested to her somehow theslipping of a fine bolt--backward, forward, she couldn't have saidwhich. The words he had uttered made him, as he stood there, beautifuland generous, invested him as with the golden air of early autumn; but,morally speaking, she retreated before them--facing him still--as shehad retreated in the other cases before a like encounter. "Oh don't saythat, please," she answered with an intensity that expressed the dreadof having, in this case too, to choose and decide. What made her dreadgreat was precisely the force which, as it would seem, ought to havebanished all dread--the sense of something within herself, deep down,that she supposed to be inspired and trustful passion. It was therelike a large sum stored in a bank--which there was a terror in havingto begin to spend. If she touched it, it would all come out.</p><p>"I haven't the idea that it will matter much to you," said Osmond."I've too little to offer you. What I have--it's enough for me; butit's not enough for you. I've neither fortune, nor fame, nor extrinsicadvantages of any kind. So I offer nothing. I only tell you because Ithink it can't offend you, and some day or other it may give youpleasure. It gives me pleasure, I assure you," he went on, standingthere before her, considerately inclined to her, turning his hat, whichhe had taken up, slowly round with a movement which had all the decenttremor of awkwardness and none of its oddity, and presenting to her hisfirm, refined, slightly ravaged face. "It gives me no pain, becauseit's perfectly simple. For me you'll always be the most important womanin the world."</p><p>Isabel looked at herself in this character--looked intently,thinking she filled it with a certain grace. But what she said was notan expression of any such complacency. "You don't offend me; but youought to remember that, without being offended, one may be incommoded,troubled." "Incommoded," she heard herself saying that, and it struckher as a ridiculous word. But it was what stupidly came to her.</p><p>"I remember perfectly. Of course you're surprised and startled. Butif it's nothing but that, it will pass away. And it will perhaps leavesomething that I may not be ashamed of."</p><p>"I don't know what it may leave. You see at all events that I'm notoverwhelmed," said Isabel with rather a pale smile. "I'm not tootroubled to think. And I think that I'm glad I leave Rome to-morrow."</p><p>"Of course I don't agree with you there."</p><p>"I don't at all KNOW you," she added abruptly; and then she colouredas she heard herself saying what she had said almost a year before toLord Warburton.</p><p>"If you were not going away you'd know me better."</p><p>"I shall do that some other time."</p><p>"I hope so. I'm very easy to know."</p><p>"No, no," she emphatically answered--"there you're not sincere. You're not easy to know; no one could be less so."</p><p>"Well," he laughed, "I said that because I know myself. It may be a boast, but I do."</p><p>"Very likely; but you're very wise."</p><p>"So are you, Miss Archer!" Osmond exclaimed.</p><p>"I don't feel so just now. Still, I'm wise enough to think you had better go. Good-night."</p><p>"God bless you!" said Gilbert Osmond, taking the hand which shefailed to surrender. After which he added: "If we meet again you'llfind me as you leave me. If we don't I shall be so all the same."</p><p>"Thank you very much. Good-bye."</p><p>There was something quietly firm about Isabel's visitor; he might goof his own movement, but wouldn't be dismissed. "There's one thingmore. I haven't asked anything of you--not even a thought in thefuture; you must do me that justice. But there's a little service Ishould like to ask. I shall not return home for several days; Rome'sdelightful, and it's a good place for a man in my state of mind. Oh, Iknow you're sorry to leave it; but you're right to do what your auntwishes."</p><p>"She doesn't even wish it!" Isabel broke out strangely.</p><p>Osmond was apparently on the point of saying something that wouldmatch these words, but he changed his mind and rejoined simply: "Ahwell, it's proper you should go with her, very proper. Do everythingthat's proper; I go in for that. Excuse my being so patronising. Yousay you don't know me, but when you do you'll discover what a worship Ihave for propriety."</p><p>"You're not conventional?" Isabel gravely asked.</p><p>"I like the way you utter that word! No, I'm not conventional: I'mconvention itself. You don't understand that?" And he paused a moment,smiling. "I should like to explain it." Then with a sudden, quick,bright naturalness, "Do come back again," he pleaded. "There are somany things we might talk about."</p><p>She stood there with lowered eyes. "What service did you speak of just now?"</p><p>"Go and see my little daughter before you leave Florence. She'salone at the villa; I decided not to send her to my sister, who hasn'tat all my ideas. Tell her she must love her poor father very much,"said Gilbert Osmond gently.</p><p>"It will be a great pleasure to me to go," Isabel answered. "I'll tell her what you say. Once more good-bye."</p><p>On this he took a rapid, respectful leave. When he had gone shestood a moment looking about her and seated herself slowly and with anair of deliberation. She sat there till her companions came back, withfolded hands, gazing at the ugly carpet. Her agitation--for it had notdiminished--was very still, very deep. What had happened was somethingthat for a week past her imagination had been going forward to meet;but here, when it came, she stopped--that sublime principle somehowbroke down. The working of this young lady's spirit was strange, and Ican only give it to you as I see it, not hoping to make it seemaltogether natural. Her imagination, as I say, now hung back: there wasa last vague space it couldn't cross--a dusky, uncertain tract whichlooked ambiguous and even slightly treacherous, like a moorland seen inthe winter twilight. But she was to cross it yet.</p></span><span id = 979 ><p>She returned on the morrow to Florence, under her cousin's escort,and Ralph Touchett, though usually restive under railway discipline,thought very well of the successive hours passed in the train thathurried his companion away from the city now distinguished by GilbertOsmond's preference--hours that were to form the first stage in alarger scheme of travel. Miss Stackpole had remained behind; she wasplanning a little trip to Naples, to be carried out with Mr. Bantling'said. Isabel was to have three days in Florence before the 4th of June,the date of Mrs. Touchett's departure, and she determined to devote thelast of these to her promise to call on Pansy Osmond. Her plan,however, seemed for a moment likely to modify itself in deference to anidea of Madame Merle's. This lady was still at Casa Touchett; but shetoo was on the point of leaving Florence, her next station being anancient castle in the mountains of Tuscany, the residence of a noblefamily of that country, whose acquaintance (she had known them, as shesaid, "forever") seemed to Isabel, in the light of certain photographsof their immense crenellated dwelling which her friend was able to showher, a precious privilege. She mentioned to this fortunate woman thatMr. Osmond had asked her to take a look at his daughter, but didn'tmention that he had also made her a declaration of love.</p><p>"Ah, comme cela se trouve!" Madame Merle exclaimed. "I myself havebeen thinking it would be a kindness to pay the child a little visitbefore I go off."</p><p>"We can go together then," Isabel reasonably said: "reasonably"because the proposal was not uttered in the spirit of enthusiasm. Shehad prefigured her small pilgrimage as made in solitude; she shouldlike it better so. She was nevertheless prepared to sacrifice thismystic sentiment to her great consideration for her friend.</p><p>That personage finely meditated. "After all, why should we both go; having, each of us, so much to do during these last hours?"</p><p>"Very good; I can easily go alone."</p><p>"I don't know about your going alone--to the house of a handsome bachelor. He has been married--but so long ago!"</p><p>Isabel stared. "When Mr. Osmond's away what does it matter?"</p><p>"They don't know he's away, you see."</p><p>"They? Whom do you mean?"</p><p>"Every one. But perhaps it doesn't signify."</p><p>"If you were going why shouldn't I?" Isabel asked.</p><p>"Because I'm an old frump and you're a beautiful young woman."</p><p>"Granting all that, you've not promised."</p><p>"How much you think of your promises!" said the elder woman in mild mockery.</p><p>"I think a great deal of my promises. Does that surprise you?"</p><p>"You're right," Madame Merle audibly reflected. "I really think you wish to be kind to the child."</p><p>"I wish very much to be kind to her."</p><p>"Go and see her then; no one will be the wiser. And tell her I'dhave come if you hadn't. Or rather," Madame Merle added, "DON'T tellher. She won't care."</p><p>As Isabel drove, in the publicity of an open vehicle, along thewinding way which led to Mr. Osmond's hill-top, she wondered what herfriend had meant by no one's being the wiser. Once in a while, at largeintervals, this lady, whose voyaging discretion, as a general thing,was rather of the open sea than of the risky channel, dropped a remarkof ambiguous quality, struck a note that sounded false. What caredIsabel Archer for the vulgar judgements of obscure people? and didMadame Merle suppose that she was capable of doing a thing at all if ithad to be sneakingly done? Of course not: she must have meant somethingelse--something which in the press of the hours that preceded herdeparture she had not had time to explain. Isabel would return to thissome day; there were sorts of things as to which she liked to be clear.She heard Pansy strumming at the piano in another place as she herselfwas ushered into Mr. Osmond's drawing-room; the little girl was"practising," and Isabel was pleased to think she performed this dutywith rigour. She immediately came in, smoothing down her frock, and didthe honours of her father's house with a wide-eyed earnestness ofcourtesy. Isabel sat there half an hour, and Pansy rose to the occasionas the small, winged fairy in the pantomime soars by the aid of thedissimulated wire --not chattering, but conversing, and showing thesame respectful interest in Isabel's affairs that Isabel was so good asto take in hers. Isabel wondered at her; she had never had so directlypresented to her nose the white flower of cultivated sweetness. Howwell the child had been taught, said our admiring young woman; howprettily she had been directed and fashioned; and yet how simple, hownatural, how innocent she had been kept! Isabel was fond, ever, of thequestion of character and quality, of sounding, as who should say, thedeep personal mystery, and it had pleased her, up to this time, to bein doubt as to whether this tender slip were not really all-knowing.Was the extremity of her candour but the perfection ofself-consciousness? Was it put on to please her father's visitor, orwas it the direct expression of an unspotted nature? The hour thatIsabel spent in Mr. Osmond's beautiful empty, dusky rooms--the windowshad been half-darkened, to keep out the heat, and here and there,through an easy crevice, the splendid summer day peeped in, lighting agleam of faded colour or tarnished gilt in the rich gloom--herinterview with the daughter of the house, I say, effectually settledthis question. Pansy was really a blank page, a pure white surface,successfully kept so; she had neither art, nor guile, nor temper, nortalent--only two or three small exquisite instincts: for knowing afriend, for avoiding a mistake, for taking care of an old toy or a newfrock. Yet to be so tender was to be touching withal, and she could befelt as an easy victim of fate. She would have no will, no power toresist, no sense of her own importance; she would easily be mystified,easily crushed: her force would be all in knowing when and where tocling. She moved about the place with her visitor, who had asked leaveto walk through the other rooms again, where Pansy gave her judgementon several works of art. She spoke of her prospects, her occupations,her father's intentions; she was not egotistical, but felt thepropriety of supplying the information so distinguished a guest wouldnaturally expect.</p><p>"Please tell me," she said, "did papa, in Rome, go to see MadameCatherine? He told me he would if he had time. Perhaps he had not time.Papa likes a great deal of time. He wished to speak about my education;it isn't finished yet, you know. I don't know what they can do with memore; but it appears it's far from finished. Papa told me one day hethought he would finish it himself; for the last year or two, at theconvent, the masters that teach the tall girls are so very dear. Papa'snot rich, and I should be very sorry if he were to pay much money forme, because I don't think I'm worth it. I don't learn quickly enough,and I have no memory. For what I'm told, yes--especially when it'spleasant; but not for what I learn in a book. There was a young girlwho was my best friend, and they took her away from the convent, whenshe was fourteen, to make--how do you say it in English?--to make adot. You don't say it in English? I hope it isn't wrong; I only meanthey wished to keep the money to marry her. I don't know whether it isfor that that papa wishes to keep the money-- to marry me. It costs somuch to marry!" Pansy went on with a sigh; "I think papa might makethat economy. At any rate I'm too young to think about it yet, and Idon't care for any gentleman; I mean for any but him. If he were not mypapa I should like to marry him; I would rather be his daughter thanthe wife of--of some strange person. I miss him very much, but not somuch as you might think, for I've been so much away from him. Papa hasalways been principally for holidays. I miss Madame Catherine almostmore; but you must not tell him that. You shall not see him again? I'mvery sorry, and he'll be sorry too. Of everyone who comes here I likeyou the best. That's not a great compliment, for there are not manypeople. It was very kind of you to come to-day--so far from your house;for I'm really as yet only a child. Oh, yes, I've only the occupationsof a child. When did YOU give them up, the occupations of a child? Ishould like to know how old you are, but I don't know whether it'sright to ask. At the convent they told us that we must never ask theage. I don't like to do anything that's not expected; it looks as ifone had not been properly taught. I myself--I should never like to betaken by surprise. Papa left directions for everything. I go to bedvery early. When the sun goes off that side I go into the garden. Papaleft strict orders that I was not to get scorched. I always enjoy theview; the mountains are so graceful. In Rome, from the convent, we sawnothing but roofs and bell-towers. I practise three hours. I don't playvery well. You play yourself? I wish very much you'd play something forme; papa has the idea that I should hear good music. Madame Merle hasplayed for me several times; that's what I like best about MadameMerle; she has great facility. I shall never have facility. And I've novoice--just a small sound like the squeak of a slate-pencil makingflourishes."</p><p>Isabel gratified this respectful wish, drew off her gloves and satdown to the piano, while Pansy, standing beside her, watched her whitehands move quickly over the keys. When she stopped she kissed the childgood-bye, held her close, looked at her long. "Be very good," she said;"give pleasure to your father."</p><p>"I think that's what I live for," Pansy answered. "He has not much pleasure; he's rather a sad man."</p><p>Isabel listened to this assertion with an interest which she felt italmost a torment to be obliged to conceal. It was her pride thatobliged her, and a certain sense of decency; there were still otherthings in her head which she felt a strong impulse, instantly checked,to say to Pansy about her father; there were things it would have givenher pleasure to hear the child, to make the child, say. But she nosooner became conscious of these things than her imagination was hushedwith horror at the idea of taking advantage of the little girl--it wasof this she would have accused herself--and of exhaling into that airwhere he might still have a subtle sense for it any breath of hercharmed state. She had come--she had come; but she had stayed only anhour. She rose quickly from the music-stool; even then, however, shelingered a moment, still holding her small companion, drawing thechild's sweet slimness closer and looking down at her almost in envy.She was obliged to confess it to herself--she would have taken apassionate pleasure in talking of Gilbert Osmond to this innocent,diminutive creature who was so near him. But she said no other word;she only kissed Pansy once again. They went together through thevestibule, to the door that opened on the court; and there her younghostess stopped, looking rather wistfully beyond. "I may go no further.I've promised papa not to pass this door."</p><p>"You're right to obey him; he'll never ask you anything unreasonable."</p><p>"I shall always obey him. But when will you come again?"</p><p>"Not for a long time, I'm afraid."</p><p>"As soon as you can, I hope. I'm only a little girl," said Pansy,"but I shall always expect you." And the small figure stood in thehigh, dark doorway, watching Isabel cross the clear, grey court anddisappear into the brightness beyond the big portone, which gave awider dazzle as it opened.</p></span><span id = 980 ><p>Isabel came back to Florence, but only after several months; aninterval sufficiently replete with incident. It is not, however, duringthis interval that we are closely concerned with her; our attention isengaged again on a certain day in the late spring-time, shortly afterher return to Palazzo Crescentini and a year from the date of theincidents just narrated. She was alone on this occasion, in one of thesmaller of the numerous rooms devoted by Mrs. Touchett to social uses,and there was that in her expression and attitude which would havesuggested that she was expecting a visitor. The tall window was open,and though its green shutters were partly drawn the bright air of thegarden had come in through a broad interstice and filled the room withwarmth and perfume. Our young woman stood near it for some time, herhands clasped behind her; she gazed abroad with the vagueness ofunrest. Too troubled for attention she moved in a vain circle. Yet itcould not be in her thought to catch a glimpse of her visitor before heshould pass into the house, since the entrance to the palace was notthrough the garden, in which stillness and privacy always reigned. Shewished rather to forestall his arrival by a process of conjecture, andto judge by the expression of her face this attempt gave her plenty todo. Grave she found herself, and positively more weighted, as by theexperience of the lapse of the year she had spent in seeing the world.She had ranged, she would have said, through space and surveyed much ofmankind, and was therefore now, in her own eyes, a very differentperson from the frivolous young woman from Albany who had begun to takethe measure of Europe on the lawn at Gardencourt a couple of yearsbefore. She flattered herself she had harvested wisdom and learned agreat deal more of life than this light-minded creature had evensuspected. If her thoughts just now had inclined themselves toretrospect, instead of fluttering their wings nervously about thepresent, they would have evoked a multitude of interesting pictures.These pictures would have been both landscapes and figure-pieces; thelatter, however, would have been the more numerous. With several of theimages that might have been projected on such a field we are alreadyacquainted. There would be for instance the conciliatory Lily, ourheroine's sister and Edmund Ludlow's wife, who had come out from NewYork to spend five months with her relative. She had left her husbandbehind her, but had brought her children, to whom Isabel now playedwith equal munificence and tenderness the part of maiden-aunt. Mr.Ludlow, toward the last, had been able to snatch a few weeks from hisforensic triumphs and, crossing the ocean with extreme rapidity, hadspent a month with the two ladies in Paris before taking his wife home.The little Ludlows had not yet, even from the American point of view,reached the proper tourist-age; so that while her sister was with herIsabel had confined her movements to a narrow circle. Lily and thebabies had joined her in Switzerland in the month of July, and they hadspent a summer of fine weather in an Alpine valley where the flowerswere thick in the meadows and the shade of great chestnuts made aresting-place for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken byladies and children on warm afternoons. They had afterwards reached theFrench capital, which was worshipped, and with costly ceremonies, byLily, but thought of as noisily vacant by Isabel, who in these daysmade use of her memory of Rome as she might have done, in a hot andcrowded room, of a phial of something pungent hidden in herhandkerchief.</p><p>Mrs. Ludlow sacrificed, as I say, to Paris, yet had doubts andwonderments not allayed at that altar; and after her husband had joinedher found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into thesespeculations. They all had Isabel for subject; but Edmund Ludlow, as hehad always done before, declined to be surprised, or distressed, ormystified, or elated, at anything his sister-in-law might have done orhave failed to do. Mrs. Ludlow's mental motions were sufficientlyvarious. At one moment she thought it would be so natural for thatyoung woman to come home and take a house in New York--the Rossiters',for instance, which had an elegant conservatory and was just round thecorner from her own; at another she couldn't conceal her surprise atthe girl's not marrying some member of one of the great aristocracies.On the whole, as I have said, she had fallen from high communion withthe probabilities. She had taken more satisfaction in Isabel'saccession of fortune than if the money had been left to herself; it hadseemed to her to offer just the proper setting for her sister'sslightly meagre, but scarce the less eminent figure. Isabel haddeveloped less, however, than Lily had thought likely--development, toLily's understanding, being somehow mysteriously connected withmorning-calls and evening-parties. Intellectually, doubtless, she hadmade immense strides; but she appeared to have achieved few of thosesocial conquests of which Mrs. Ludlow had expected to admire thetrophies. Lily's conception of such achievements was extremely vague;but this was exactly what she had expected of Isabel--to give it formand body. Isabel could have done as well as she had done in New York;and Mrs. Ludlow appealed to her husband to know whether there was anyprivilege she enjoyed in Europe which the society of that city mightnot offer her. We know ourselves that Isabel had madeconquests--whether inferior or not to those she might have effected inher native land it would be a delicate matter to decide; and it is notaltogether with a feeling of complacency that I again mention that shehad not rendered these honourable victories public. She had not toldher sister the history of Lord Warburton, nor had she given her a hintof Mr. Osmond's state of mind; and she had had no better reason for hersilence than that she didn't wish to speak. It was more romantic to saynothing, and, drinking deep, in secret, of romance, she was as littledisposed to ask poor Lily's advice as she would have been to close thatrare volume forever. But Lily knew nothing of these discriminations,and could only pronounce her sister's career a strange anti-climax--animpression confirmed by the fact that Isabel's silence about Mr.Osmond, for instance, was in direct proportion to the frequency withwhich he occupied her thoughts. As this happened very often itsometimes appeared to Mrs. Ludlow that she had lost her courage. Souncanny a result of so exhilarating an incident as inheriting a fortunewas of course perplexing to the cheerful Lily; it added to her generalsense that Isabel was not at all like other people.</p><p>Our young lady's courage, however, might have been taken as reachingits height after her relations had gone home. She could imagine braverthings than spending the winter in Paris--Paris had sides by which itso resembled New York, Paris was like smart, neat prose--and her closecorrespondence with Madame Merle did much to stimulate such flights.She had never had a keener sense of freedom, of the absolute boldnessand wantonness of liberty, than when she turned away from the platformat the Euston Station on one of the last days of November, after thedeparture of the train that was to convey poor Lily, her husband andher children to their ship at Liverpool. It had been good for her toregale; she was very conscious of that; she was very observant, as weknow, of what was good for her, and her effort was constantly to findsomething that was good enough. To profit by the present advantage tillthe latest moment she had made the journey from Paris with the unenviedtravellers. She would have accompanied them to Liverpool as well, onlyEdmund Ludlow had asked her, as a favour, not to do so; it made Lily sofidgety and she asked such impossible questions. Isabel watched thetrain move away; she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews,a demonstrative child who leaned dangerously far out of the window ofthe carriage and made separation an occasion of violent hilarity, andthen she walked back into the foggy London street. The world lay beforeher--she could do whatever she chose. There was a deep thrill in itall, but for the present her choice was tolerably discreet; she chosesimply to walk back from Euston Square to her hotel. The early dusk ofa November afternoon had already closed in; the street-lamps, in thethick, brown air, looked weak and red; our heroine was unattended andEuston Square was a long way from Piccadilly. But Isabel performed thejourney with a positive enjoyment of its dangers and lost her wayalmost on purpose, in order to get more sensations, so that she wasdisappointed when an obliging policeman easily set her right again. Shewas so fond of the spectacle of human life that she enjoyed even theaspect of gathering dusk in the London streets-- the moving crowds, thehurrying cabs, the lighted shops, the flaring stalls, the dark, shiningdampness of everything. That evening, at her hotel, she wrote to MadameMerle that she should start in a day or two for Rome. She made her waydown to Rome without touching at Florence--having gone first to Veniceand then proceeded southward by Ancona. She accomplished this journeywithout other assistance than that of her servant, for her naturalprotectors were not now on the ground. Ralph Touchett was spending thewinter at Corfu, and Miss Stackpole, in the September previous, hadbeen recalled to America by a telegram from the Interviewer. Thisjournal offered its brilliant correspondent a fresher field for hergenius than the mouldering cities of Europe, and Henrietta was cheeredon her way by a promise from Mr. Bantling that he would soon come overto see her. Isabel wrote to Mrs. Touchett to apologise for notpresenting herself just yet in Florence, and her aunt repliedcharacteristically enough. Apologies, Mrs. Touchett intimated, were ofno more use to her than bubbles, and she herself never dealt in sucharticles. One either did the thing or one didn't, and what one "would"have done belonged to the sphere of the irrelevant, like the idea of afuture life or of the origin of things. Her letter was frank, but (arare case with Mrs. Touchett) not so frank as it pretended. She easilyforgave her niece for not stopping at Florence, because she took it fora sign that Gilbert Osmond was less in question there than formerly.She watched of course to see if he would now find a pretext for goingto Rome, and derived some comfort from learning that he had not beenguilty of an absence. Isabel, on her side, had not been a fortnight inRome before she proposed to Madame Merle that they should make a littlepilgrimage to the East. Madame Merle remarked that her friend wasrestless, but she added that she herself had always been consumed withthe desire to visit Athens and Constantinople. The two ladiesaccordingly embarked on this expedition, and spent three months inGreece, in Turkey, in Egypt. Isabel found much to interest her in thesecountries, though Madame Merle continued to remark that even among themost classic sites, the scenes most calculated to suggest repose andreflexion, a certain incoherence prevailed in her. Isabel travelledrapidly and recklessly; she was like a thirsty person draining cupafter cup. Madame Merle meanwhile, as lady-in-waiting to a princesscirculating incognita, panted a little in her rear. It was on Isabel'sinvitation she had come, and she imparted all due dignity to the girl'suncountenanced state. She played her part with the tact that might havebeen expected of her, effacing herself and accepting the position of acompanion whose expenses were profusely paid. The situation, however,had no hardships, and people who met this reserved though striking pairon their travels would not have been able to tell you which waspatroness and which client. To say that Madame Merle improved onacquaintance states meagrely the impression she made on her friend, whohad found her from the first so ample and so easy. At the end of anintimacy of three months Isabel felt she knew her better; her characterhad revealed itself, and the admirable woman had also at last redeemedher promise of relating her history from her own point of view--aconsummation the more desirable as Isabel had already heard it relatedfrom the point of view of others. This history was so sad a one (in sofar as it concerned the late M. Merle, a positive adventurer, she mightsay, though originally so plausible, who had taken advantage, yearsbefore, of her youth and of an inexperience in which doubtless thosewho knew her only now would find it difficult to believe</span><span id = 981 ><p>It was not of him, nevertheless, that she was thinking while shestood at the window near which we found her a while ago, and it was notof any of the matters I have rapidly sketched. She was not turned tothe past, but to the immediate, impending hour. She had reason toexpect a scene, and she was not fond of scenes. She was not askingherself what she should say to her visitor; this question had alreadybeen answered. What he would say to her-- that was the interestingissue. It could be nothing in the least soothing--she had warrant forthis, and the conviction doubtless showed in the cloud on her brow. Forthe rest, however, all clearness reigned in her; she had put away hermourning and she walked in no small shimmering splendour. She only,felt older-- ever so much, and as if she were "worth more" for it, likesome curious piece in an antiquary's collection. She was not at anyrate left indefinitely to her apprehensions, for a servant at laststood before her with a card on his tray. "Let the gentleman come in,"she said, and continued to gaze out of the window after the footman hadretired. It was only when she had heard the door close behind theperson who presently entered that she looked round.</p><p>Caspar Goodwood stood there--stood and received a moment, from headto foot, the bright, dry gaze with which she rather withheld thanoffered a greeting. Whether his sense of maturity had kept pace withIsabel's we shall perhaps presently ascertain; let me say meanwhilethat to her critical glance he showed nothing of the injury of time.Straight, strong and hard, there was nothing in his appearance thatspoke positively either of youth or of age; if he had neither innocencenor weakness, so he had no practical philosophy. His jaw showed thesame voluntary cast as in earlier days; but a crisis like the presenthad in it of course something grim. He had the air of a man who hadtravelled hard; he said nothing at first, as if he had been out ofbreath. This gave Isabel time to make a reflexion: "Poor fellow, whatgreat things he's capable of, and what a pity he should waste sodreadfully his splendid force! What a pity too that one can't satisfyeverybody!" It gave her time to do more to say at the end of a minute:"I can't tell you how I hoped you wouldn't come!"</p><p>"I've no doubt of that." And he looked about him for a seat. Not only had he come, but he meant to settle.</p><p>"You must be very tired," said Isabel, seating herself, and generously, as she thought, to give him his opportunity.</p><p>"No, I'm not at all tired. Did you ever know me to be tired?"</p><p>"Never; I wish I had! When did you arrive?"</p><p>"Last night, very late; in a kind of snail-train they call theexpress. These Italian trains go at about the rate of an Americanfuneral."</p><p>"That's in keeping--you must have felt as if you were coming to buryme!" And she forced a smile of encouragement to an easy view of theirsituation. She had reasoned the matter well out, making it perfectlyclear that she broke no faith and falsified no contract; but for allthis she was afraid of her visitor. She was ashamed of her fear; butshe was devoutly thankful there was nothing else to be ashamed of. Helooked at her with his stiff insistence, an insistence in which therewas such a want of tact; especially when the dull dark beam in his eyerested on her as a physical weight.</p><p>"No, I didn't feel that; I couldn't think of you as dead. I wish I could!" he candidly declared.</p><p>"I thank you immensely."</p><p>"I'd rather think of you as dead than as married to another man."</p><p>"That's very selfish of you!" she returned with the ardour of a realconviction. "If you're not happy yourself others have yet a right tobe."</p><p>"Very likely it's selfish; but I don't in the least mind your sayingso. I don't mind anything you can say now--I don't feel it. Thecruellest things you could think of would be mere pin-pricks. Afterwhat you've done I shall never feel anything-- I mean anything butthat. That I shall feel all my life."</p><p>Mr. Goodwood made these detached assertions with dry deliberateness,in his hard, slow American tone, which flung no atmospheric colour overpropositions intrinsically crude. The tone made Isabel angry ratherthan touched her; but her anger perhaps was fortunate, inasmuch as itgave her a further reason for controlling herself. It was under thepressure of this control that she became, after a little, irrelevant."When did you leave New York?"</p><p>He threw up his head as if calculating. "Seventeen days ago."</p><p>"You must have travelled fast in spite of your slow trains."</p><p>"I came as fast as I could. I'd have come five days ago if I had been able."</p><p>"It wouldn't have made any difference, Mr. Goodwood," she coldly smiled.</p><p>"Not to you--no. But to me."</p><p>"You gain nothing that I see."</p><p>"That's for me to judge!"</p><p>"Of course. To me it seems that you only torment yourself." Andthen, to change the subject, she asked him if he had seen HenriettaStackpole. He looked as if he had not come from Boston to Florence totalk of Henrietta Stackpole; but he answered, distinctly enough, thatthis young lady had been with him just before he left America. "Shecame to see you?" Isabel then demanded.</p><p>"Yes, she was in Boston, and she called at my office. It was the day I had got your letter."</p><p>"Did you tell her?" Isabel asked with a certain anxiety.</p><p>"Oh no," said Caspar Goodwood simply; "I didn't want to do that. She'll hear it quick enough; she hears everything."</p><p>"I shall write to her, and then she'll write to me and scold me," Isabel declared, trying to smile again.</p><p>Caspar, however, remained sternly grave. "I guess she'll come right out," he said.</p><p>"On purpose to scold me?"</p><p>"I don't know. She seemed to think she had not seen Europe thoroughly."</p><p>"I'm glad you tell me that," Isabel said. "I must prepare for her."</p><p>Mr. Goodwood fixed his eyes for a moment on the floor; then at last, raising them, "Does she know Mr. Osmond?" he enquired.</p><p>"A little. And she doesn't like him. But of course I don't marry toplease Henrietta," she added. It would have been better for poor Casparif she had tried a little more to gratify Miss Stackpole; but he didn'tsay so; he only asked, presently, when her marriage would take place.To which she made answer that she didn't know yet. "I can only say itwill be soon. I've told no one but yourself and one other person--anold friend of Mr. Osmond's."</p><p>"Is it a marriage your friends won't like?" he demanded.</p><p>"I really haven't an idea. As I say, I don't marry for my friends."</p><p>He went on, making no exclamation, no comment, only askingquestions, doing it quite without delicacy. "Who and what then is Mr.Gilbert Osmond?"</p><p>"Who and what? Nobody and nothing but a very good and veryhonourable man. He's not in business," said Isabel. "He's not rich;he's not known for anything in particular."</p><p>She disliked Mr. Goodwood's questions, but she said to herself thatshe owed it to him to satisfy him as far as possible. The satisfactionpoor Caspar exhibited was, however, small; he sat very upright, gazingat her. "Where does he come from? Where does he belong?"</p><p>She had never been so little pleased with the way he said "belawng.""He comes from nowhere. He has spent most of his life in Italy."</p><p>"You said in your letter he was American. Hasn't he a native place?"</p><p>"Yes, but he has forgotten it. He left it as a small boy."</p><p>"Has he never gone back?"</p><p>"Why should he go back?" Isabel asked, flushing all defensively. "He has no profession."</p><p>"He might have gone back for his pleasure. Doesn't he like the United States?"</p><p>"He doesn't know them. Then he's very quiet and very simple--he contents himself with Italy."</p><p>"With Italy and with you," said Mr. Goodwood with gloomy plainnessand no appearance of trying to make an epigram. "What has he everdone?" he added abruptly.</p><p>"That I should marry him? Nothing at all," Isabel replied while herpatience helped itself by turning a little to hardness. "If he had donegreat things would you forgive me any better? Give me up, Mr. Goodwood;I'm marrying a perfect nonentity. Don't try to take an interest in him.You can't."</p><p>"I can't appreciate him; that's what you mean. And you don't mean inthe least that he's a perfect nonentity. You think he's grand, youthink he's great, though no one else thinks so."</p><p>Isabel's colour deepened; she felt this really acute of hercompanion, and it was certainly a proof of the aid that passion mightrender perceptions she had never taken for fine. "Why do you alwayscomeback to what others think? I can't discuss Mr. Osmond with you."</p><p>"Of course not," said Caspar reasonably. And he sat there with hisair of stiff helplessness, as if not only this were true, but therewere nothing else that they might discuss.</p><p>"You see how little you gain," she accordingly broke out--"how little comfort or satisfaction I can give you."</p><p>"I didn't expect you to give me much."</p><p>"I don't understand then why you came."</p><p>"I came because I wanted to see you once more--even just as you are."</p><p>"I appreciate that; but if you had waited a while, sooner or laterwe should have been sure to meet, and our meeting would have beenpleasanter for each of us than this."</p><p>"Waited till after you're married? That's just what I didn't want to do. You'll be different then."</p><p>"Not very. I shall still be a great friend of yours. You'll see."</p><p>"That will make it all the worse," said Mr. Goodwood grimly.</p><p>"Ah, you're unaccommodating! I can't promise to dislike you in order to help you to resign yourself."</p><p>"I shouldn't care if you did!"</p><p>Isabel got up with a movement of repressed impatience and walked tothe window, where she remained a moment looking out. When she turnedround her visitor was still motionless in his place. She came towardhim again and stopped, resting her hand on the back of the chair shehad just quitted. "Do you mean you came simply to look at me? That'sbetter for you perhaps than for me."</p><p>"I wished to hear the sound of your voice," he said.</p><p>"You've heard it, and you see it says nothing very sweet."</p><p>"It gives me pleasure, all the same." And with this he got up. Shehad felt pain and displeasure on receiving early that day the news hewas in Florence and by her leave would come within an hour to see her.She had been vexed and distressed, though she had sent back word by hismessenger that he might come when he would. She had not been betterpleased when she saw him; his being there at all was so full of heavyimplications. It implied things she could never assent to--rights,reproaches, remonstrance, rebuke, the expectation of making her changeher purpose. These things, however, if implied, had not been expressed;and now our young lady, strangely enough, began to resent her visitor'sremarkable self-control. There was a dumb misery about him thatirritated her; there was a manly staying of his hand that made herheart beat faster. She felt her agitation rising, and she said toherself that she was angry in the way a woman is angry when she hasbeen in the wrong. She was not in the wrong; she had fortunately notthat bitterness to swallow; but, all the same, she wished he woulddenounce her a little. She had wished his visit would be short; it hadno purpose, no propriety; yet now that he seemed to be turning away shefelt a sudden horror of his leaving her without uttering a word thatwould give her an opportunity to defend herself more than she had donein writing to him a month before, in a few carefully chosen words, toannounce her engagement. If she were not in the wrong, however, whyshould she desire to defend herself? It was an excess of generosity onIsabel's part to desire that Mr. Goodwood should be angry. And if hehad not meanwhile held himself hard it might have made him so to hearthe tone in which she suddenly exclaimed, as if she were accusing himof having accused her: "I've not deceived you! I was perfectly free!"</p><p>"Yes, I know that," said Caspar.</p><p>"I gave you full warning that I'd do as I chose."</p><p>"You said you'd probably never marry, and you said it with such a manner that I pretty well believed it."</p><p>She considered this an instant. "No one can be more surprised than myself at my present intention."</p><p>"You told me that if I heard you were engaged I was not to believeit," Caspar went on. "I heard it twenty days ago from yourself, but Iremembered what you had said. I thought there might be some mistake,and that's partly why I came."</p><p>"If you wish me to repeat it by word of mouth, that's soon done. There's no mistake whatever."</p><p>"I saw that as soon as I came into the room."</p><p>"What good would it do you that I shouldn't marry?" she asked with a certain fierceness.</p><p>"I should like it better than this."</p><p>"You're very selfish, as I said before."</p><p>"I know that. I'm selfish as iron."</p><p>"Even iron sometimes melts! If you'll be reasonable I'll see you again."</p><p>"Don't you call me reasonable now?"</p><p>"I don't know what to say to you," she answered with sudden humility.</p><p>"I shan't trouble you for a long time," the young man went on. Hemade a step towards the door, but he stopped. "Another reason why Icame was that I wanted to hear what you would say in explanation ofyour having changed your mind."</p><p>Her humbleness as suddenly deserted her. "In explanation? Do you think I'm bound to explain?"</p><p>He gave her one of his long dumb looks. "You were very positive. I did believe it."</p><p>"So did I. Do you think I could explain if I would?"</p><p>"No, I suppose not. Well," he added, "I've done what I wished. I've seen you."</p><p>"How little you make of these terrible journeys," she felt the poverty of her presently replying.</p><p>"If you're afraid I'm knocked up--in any such way as that--you mayhe at your ease about it." He turned away, this time in earnest, and nohand-shake, no sign of parting, was exchanged between them.</p><p>At the door he stopped with his hand on the knob. "I shall leave Florence to-morrow," he said without a quaver.</p><p>"I'm delighted to hear it!" she answered passionately. Five minutes after he had gone out she burst into tears.</p></span><span id = 982 ><p>Her fit of weeping, however, was soon smothered, and the signs of ithad vanished when, an hour later, she broke the news to her aunt. I usethis expression because she had been sure Mrs. Touchett would not bepleased; Isabel had only waited to tell her till she had seen Mr.Goodwood. She had an odd impression that it would not be honourable tomake the fact public before she should have heard what Mr. Goodwoodwould say about it. He had said rather less than she expected, and shenow had a somewhat angry sense of having lost time. But she would loseno more; she waited till Mrs. Touchett came into the drawing-roombefore the mid-day breakfast, and then she began. "Aunt Lydia, I'vesomething to tell you."</p><p>Mrs. Touchett gave a little jump and looked at her almost fiercely. "You needn't tell me; I know what it is."</p><p>"I don't know how you know."</p><p>"The same way that I know when the window's open--by feeling a draught. You're going to marry that man."</p><p>"What man do you mean?" Isabel enquired with great dignity.</p><p>"Madame Merle's friend--Mr. Osmond."</p><p>"I don't know why you call him Madame Merle's friend. Is that the principal thing he's known by?"</p><p>"If he's not her friend he ought to be--after what she has done forhim!" cried Mrs. Touchett. "I shouldn't have expected it of her; I'mdisappointed."</p><p>"If you mean that Madame Merle has had anything to do with myengagement you're greatly mistaken," Isabel declared with a sort ofardent coldness.</p><p>"You mean that your attractions were sufficient, without thegentleman's having had to be lashed up? You're quite right. They'reimmense, your attractions, and he would never have presumed to think ofyou if she hadn't put him up to it. He has a very good opinion ofhimself, but he was not a man to take trouble. Madame Merle took thetrouble for him."</p><p>"He has taken a great deal for himself!" cried Isabel with a voluntary laugh.</p><p>Mrs. Touchett gave a sharp nod. "I think he must, after all, to have made you like him so much."</p><p>"I thought he even pleased YOU."</p><p>"He did, at one time; and that's why I'm angry with him."</p><p>"Be angry with me, not with him," said the girl.</p><p>"Oh, I'm always angry with you; that's no satisfaction! Was it for this that you refused Lord Warburton?"</p><p>"Please don't go back to that. Why shouldn't I like Mr. Osmond, since others have done so?"</p><p>"Others, at their wildest moments, never wanted to marry him. There's nothing OF him," Mrs. Touchett explained.</p><p>"Then he can't hurt me," said Isabel.</p><p>"Do you think you're going to be happy? No one's happy, in such doings, you should know."</p><p>"I shall set the fashion then. What does one marry for?"</p><p>"What YOU will marry for, heaven only knows. People usually marry asthey go into partnership--to set up a house. But in your partnershipyou'll bring everything."</p><p>"Is it that Mr. Osmond isn't rich? Is that what you're talking about?" Isabel asked.</p><p>"He has no money; he has no name; he has no importance. I value suchthings and I have the courage to say it; I think they're very precious.Many other people think the same, and they show it. But they give someother reason."</p><p>Isabel hesitated a little. "I think I value everything that'svaluable. I care very much for money, and that's why I wish Mr. Osmondto have a little."</p><p>"Give it to him then; but marry some one else."</p><p>"His name's good enough for me," the girl went on. "It's a very pretty name. Have I such a fine one myself?"</p><p>"All the more reason you should improve on it. There are only a dozen American names. Do you marry him out of charity?"</p><p>"It was my duty to tell you, Aunt Lydia, but I don't think it's myduty to explain to you. Even if it were I shouldn't be able. So pleasedon't remonstrate; in talking about it you have me at a disadvantage. Ican't talk about it."</p><p>"I don't remonstrate, I simply answer you: I must give some sign ofintelligence. I saw it coming, and I said nothing. I never meddle."</p><p>"You never do, and I'm greatly obliged to you. You've been very considerate."</p><p>"It was not considerate--it was convenient," said Mrs. Touchett. "But I shall talk to Madame Merle."</p><p>"I don't see why you keep bringing her in. She has been a very good friend to me."</p><p>"Possibly; but she has been a poor one to me."</p><p>"What has she done to you?"</p><p>"She has deceived me. She had as good as promised me to prevent your engagement."</p><p>"She couldn't have prevented it."</p><p>"She can do anything; that's what I've always liked her for. I knewshe could play any part; but I understood that she played them one byone. I didn't understand that she would play two at the same time."</p><p>"I don't know what part she may have played to you," Isabel said;"that's between yourselves. To me she has been honest and kind anddevoted."</p><p>"Devoted, of course; she wished you to marry her candidate. She told me she was watching you only in order to interpose."</p><p>"She said that to please you," the girl answered; conscious, however, of the inadequacy of the explanation.</p><p>"To please me by deceiving me? She knows me better. Am I pleased to-day?"</p><p>"I don't think you're ever much pleased," Isabel was obliged toreply. "If Madame Merle knew you would learn the truth what had she togain by insincerity?"</p><p>"She gained time, as you see. While I waited for her to interfere you were marching away, and she was really beating the drum."</p><p>"That's very well. But by your own admission you saw I was marching,and even if she had given the alarm you wouldn't have tried to stop me."</p><p>"No, but some one else would."</p><p>"Whom do you mean?" Isabel asked, looking very hard at her aunt.Mrs. Touchett's little bright eyes, active as they usually were,sustained her gaze rather than returned it. "Would you have listened toRalph?"</p><p>"Not if he had abused Mr. Osmond."</p><p>"Ralph doesn't abuse people; you know that perfectly. He cares very much for you."</p><p>"I know he does," said Isabel; "and I shall feel the value of it now, for he knows that whatever I do I do with reason."</p><p>"He never believed you would do this. I told him you were capable of it, and he argued the other way."</p><p>"He did it for the sake of argument," the girl smiled. "You don'taccuse him of having deceived you; why should you accuse Madame Merle?"</p><p>"He never pretended he'd prevent it."</p><p>"I'm glad of that!" cried Isabel gaily. "I wish very much," shepresently added, "that when he comes you'd tell him first of myengagement."</p><p>"Of course I'll mention it," said Mrs. Touchett. "I shall saynothing more to you about it, but I give you notice I shall talk toothers."</p><p>"That's as you please. I only meant that it's rather better the announcement should come from you than from me."</p><p>"I quite agree with you; it's much more proper!" And on this theaunt and the niece went to breakfast, where Mrs. Touchett, as good asher word, made no allusion to Gilbert Osmond. After an interval ofsilence, however, she asked her companion from whom she had received avisit an hour before.</p><p>"From an old friend--an American gentleman," Isabel said with a colour in her cheek.</p><p>"An American gentleman of course. It's only an American gentleman who calls at ten o'clock in the morning."</p><p>"It was half-past ten; he was in a great hurry; he goes away this evening."</p><p>"Couldn't he have come yesterday, at the usual time?"</p><p>"He only arrived last night."</p><p>"He spends but twenty-four hours in Florence?" Mrs. Touchett cried. "He's an American gentleman truly."</p><p>"He is indeed," said Isabel, thinking with perverse admiration of what Caspar Goodwood had done for her.</p><p>Two days afterward Ralph arrived; but though Isabel was sure thatMrs. Touchett had lost no time in imparting to him the great fact, heshowed at first no open knowledge of it. Their prompted talk wasnaturally of his health; Isabel had many questions to ask about Corfu.She had been shocked by his appearance when he came into the room; shehad forgotten how ill he looked. In spite of Corfu he looked very illto-day, and she wondered if he were really worse or if she were simplydisaccustomed to living with an invalid. Poor Ralph made no nearerapproach to conventional beauty as he advanced in life, and the nowapparently complete loss of his health had done little to mitigate thenatural oddity of his person. Blighted and battered, but stillresponsive and still ironic, his face was like a lighted lanternpatched with paper and unsteadily held; his thin whisker languishedupon a lean cheek; the exorbitant curve of his nose defined itself moresharply. Lean he was altogether, lean and long and loose-jointed; anaccidental cohesion of relaxed angles. His brown velvet jacket hadbecome perennial; his hands had fixed themselves in his pockets; heshambled and stumbled and shuffled in a manner that denoted greatphysical helplessness. It was perhaps this whimsical gait that helpedto mark his character more than ever as that of the humorousinvalid--the invalid for whom even his own disabilities are part of thegeneral joke. They might well indeed with Ralph have been the chiefcause of the want of seriousness marking his view of a world in whichthe reason for his own continued presence was past finding out. Isabelhad grown fond of his ugliness; his awkwardness had become dear to her.They had been sweetened by association; they struck her as the veryterms on which it had been given him to be charming. He was so charmingthat her sense of his being ill had hitherto had a sort of comfort init; the state of his health had seemed not a limitation, but a kind ofintellectual advantage; it absolved him from all professional andofficial emotions and left him the luxury of being exclusivelypersonal. The personality so resulting was delightful; he had remainedproof against the staleness of disease; he had had to consent to bedeplorably ill, yet had somehow escaped being formally sick. Such hadbeen the girl's impression of her cousin; and when she had pitied himit was only on reflection. As she reflected a good deal she had allowedhim a certain amount of compassion; but she always had a dread ofwasting that essence--a precious article, worth more to the giver thanto any one else. Now, however, it took no great sensibility to feelthat poor Ralph's tenure of life was less elastic than it should be. Hewas a bright, free, generous spirit, he had all the illumination ofwisdom and none of its pedantry, and yet he was distressfully dying.</p><p>Isabel noted afresh that life was certainly hard for some people,and she felt a delicate glow of shame as she thought how easy it nowpromised to become for herself. She was prepared to learn that Ralphwas not pleased with her engagement; but she was not prepared, in spiteof her affection for him, to let this fact spoil the situation. She wasnot even prepared, or so she thought, to resent his want of sympathy;for it would be his privilege--it would be indeed his natural line--tofind fault with any step she might take toward marriage. One's cousinalways pretended to hate one's husband; that was traditional,classical; it was a part of one's cousin's always pretending to adoreone. Ralph was nothing if not critical; and though she would certainly,other things being equal, have been as glad to marry to please him asto please any one, it would be absurd to regard as important that herchoice should square with his views. What were his views after all? Hehad pretended to believe she had better have married Lord Warburton;but this was only because she had refused that excellent man. If shehad accepted him Ralph would certainly have taken another tone; healways took the opposite. You could criticise any marriage; it was theessence of a marriage to be open to criticism. How well she herself,should she only give her mind to it, might criticise this union of herown! She had other employment, however, and Ralph was welcome torelieve her of the care. Isabel was prepared to be most patient andmost indulgent. He must have seen that, and this made it the more oddhe should say nothing. After three days had elapsed without hisspeaking our young woman wearied of waiting; dislike it as he would, hemight at least go through the form. We, who know more about poor Ralphthan his cousin, may easily believe that during the hours that followedhis arrival at Palazzo Crescentini he had privately gone through manyforms. His mother had literally greeted him with the great news, whichhad been even more sensibly chilling than Mrs. Touchett's maternalkiss. Ralph was shocked and humiliated; his calculations had been falseand the person in the world in whom he was most interested was lost. Hedrifted about the house like a rudderless vessel in a rocky stream, orsat in the garden of the palace on a great cane chair, his long legsextended, his head thrown back and his hat pulled over his eyes. Hefelt cold about the heart; he had never liked anything less. What couldhe do, what could he say? If the girl were irreclaimable could hepretend to like it? To attempt to reclaim her was permissible only ifthe attempt should succeed. To try to persuade her of anything sordidor sinister in the man to whose deep art she had succumbed would bedecently discreet only in the event of her being persuaded. Otherwisehe should simply have damned himself. It cost him an equal effort tospeak his thought and to dissemble; he could neither assent withsincerity nor protest with hope. Meanwhile he knew--or rather hesupposed--that the affianced pair were daily renewing their mutualvows. Osmond at this moment showed himself little at PalazzoCrescentini; but Isabel met him every day elsewhere, as she was free todo after their engagement had been made public. She had taken acarriage by the month, so as not to be indebted to her aunt for themeans of pursuing a course of which Mrs. Touchett disapproved, and shedrove in the morning to the Cascine. This suburban wilderness, duringthe early hours, was void of all intruders, and our young lady, joinedby her lover in its quietest part, strolled with him a while throughthe grey Italian shade and listened to the nightingales.</p></span><span id = 983 ><p>One morning, on her return from her drive, some half-hour beforeluncheon, she quitted her vehicle in the court of the palace and,instead of ascending the great staircase, crossed the court, passedbeneath another archway and entered the garden. A sweeter spot at thismoment could not have been imagined. The stillness of noontide hungover it, and the warm shade, enclosed and still, made bowers likespacious caves. Ralph was sitting there in the clear gloom, at the baseof a statue of Terpsichore--a dancing nymph with taper fingers andinflated draperies in the manner of Bernini; the extreme relaxation ofhis attitude suggested at first to Isabel that he was asleep. Her lightfootstep on the grass had not roused him, and before turning away shestood for a moment looking at him. During this instant he opened hiseyes; upon which she sat down on a rustic chair that matched with hisown. Though in her irritation she had accused him of indifference shewas not blind to the fact that he had visibly had something to broodover. But she had explained his air of absence partly by the languor ofhis increased weakness, partly by worries connected with the propertyinherited from his father--the fruit of eccentric arrangements of whichMrs. Touchett disapproved and which, as she had told Isabel, nowencountered opposition from the other partners in the bank. He ought tohave gone to England, his mother said, instead of coming to Florence;he had not been there for months, and took no more interest in the bankthan in the state of Patagonia.</p><p>"I'm sorry I waked you," Isabel said; "you look too tired."</p><p>"I feel too tired. But I was not asleep. I was thinking of you."</p><p>"Are you tired of that?"</p><p>"Very much so. It leads to nothing. The road's long and I never arrive."</p><p>"What do you wish to arrive at?" she put to him, closing her parasol.</p><p>"At the point of expressing to myself properly what I think of your engagement."</p><p>"Don't think too much of it," she lightly returned.</p><p>"Do you mean that it's none of my business?"</p><p>"Beyond a certain point, yes."</p><p>"That's the point I want to fix. I had an idea you may have found me wanting in good manners. I've never congratulated you."</p><p>"Of course I've noticed that. I wondered why you were silent."</p><p>"There have been a good many reasons. I'll tell you now," Ralphsaid. He pulled off his hat and laid it on the ground; then he satlooking at her. He leaned back under the protection of Bernini, hishead against his marble pedestal, his arms dropped on either side ofhim, his hands laid upon the rests of his wide chair. He lookedawkward, uncomfortable; he hesitated long. Isabel said nothing; whenpeople were embarrassed she was usually sorry for them, but she wasdetermined not to help Ralph to utter a word that should not be to thehonour of her high decision. "I think I've hardly got over mysurprise," he went on at last. "You were the last person I expected tosee caught."</p><p>"I don't know why you call it caught."</p><p>"Because you're going to be put into a cage."</p><p>"If I like my cage, that needn't trouble you," she answered.</p><p>"That's what I wonder at; that's what I've been thinking of."</p><p>"If you've been thinking you may imagine how I've thought! I'm satisfied that I'm doing well."</p><p>"You must have changed immensely. A year ago you valued your liberty beyond everything. You wanted only to see life."</p><p>"I've seen it," said Isabel. "It doesn't look to me now, I admit, such an inviting expanse."</p><p>"I don't pretend it is; only I had an idea that you took a genial view of it and wanted to survey the whole field."</p><p>"I've seen that one can't do anything so general. One must choose a corner and cultivate that."</p><p>"That's what I think. And one must choose as good a corner aspossible. I had no idea, all winter, while I read your delightfulletters, that you were choosing. You said nothing about it, and yoursilence put me off my guard."</p><p>"It was not a matter I was likely to write to you about. Besides, Iknew nothing of the future. It has all come lately. If you had been onyour guard, however," Isabel asked, "what would you have done?"</p><p>"I should have said 'Wait a little longer.'"</p><p>"Wait for what?"</p><p>"Well, for a little more light," said Ralph with rather an absurd smile, while his hands found their way into his pockets.</p><p>"Where should my light have come from? From you?"</p><p>"I might have struck a spark or two."</p><p>Isabel had drawn off her gloves; she smoothed them out as they layupon her knee. The mildness of this movement was accidental, for herexpression was not conciliatory. "You're beating about the bush, Ralph.You wish to say you don't like Mr. Osmond, and yet you're afraid."</p><p>"Willing to wound and yet afraid to strike? I'm willing to woundHIM, yes--but not to wound you. I'm afraid of you, not of him. If youmarry him it won't be a fortunate way for me to have spoken."</p><p>"IF I marry him! Have you had any expectation of dissuading me?"</p><p>"Of course that seems to you too fatuous."</p><p>"No," said Isabel after a little; "it seems to me too touching."</p><p>"That's the same thing. It makes me so ridiculous that you pity me."</p><p>She stroked out her long gloves again. "I know you've a great affection for me. I can't get rid of that."</p><p>"For heaven's sake don't try. Keep that well in sight. It will convince you how intensely I want you to do well."</p><p>"And how little you trust me!"</p><p>There was a moment's silence; the warm noontide seemed to listen. "I trust you, but I don't trust him," said Ralph.</p><p>She raised her eyes and gave him a wide, deep look. "You've said itnow, and I'm glad you've made it so clear. But you'll suffer by it."</p><p>"Not if you're just."</p><p>"I'm very just," said Isabel. "What better proof of it can there bethan that I'm not angry with you? I don't know what's the matter withme, but I'm not. I was when you began, but it has passed away. PerhapsI ought to be angry, but Mr. Osmond wouldn't think so. He wants me toknow everything; that's what I like him for. You've nothing to gain, Iknow that. I've never been so nice to you, as a girl, that you shouldhave much reason for wishing me to remain one. You give very goodadvice; you've often done so. No, I'm very quiet; I've always believedin your wisdom," she went on, boasting of her quietness, yet speakingwith a kind of contained exaltation. It was her passionate desire to bejust; it touched Ralph to the heart, affected him like a caress from acreature he had injured. He wished to interrupt, to reassure her; for amoment he was absurdly inconsistent; he would have retracted what hehad said. But she gave him no chance; she went on, having caught aglimpse, as she thought, of the heroic line and desiring to advance inthat direction. "I see you've some special idea; I should like verymuch to hear it. I'm sure it's disinterested; I feel that. It seems astrange thing to argue about, and of course I ought to tell youdefinitely that if you expect to dissuade me you may give it up. You'llnot move me an inch; it's too late. As you say, I'm caught. Certainlyit won't be pleasant for you to remember this, but your pain will be inyour own thoughts. I shall never reproach you."</p><p>"I don't think you ever will," said Ralph. "It's not in the least the sort of marriage I thought you'd make."</p><p>"What sort of marriage was that, pray?"</p><p>"Well, I can hardly say. I hadn't exactly a positive view of it, butI had a negative. I didn't think you'd decide for--well, for that type."</p><p>"What's the matter with Mr. Osmond's type, if it be one? His beingso independent, so individual, is what I most see in him," the girldeclared. "What do you know against him? You know him scarcely at all."</p><p>"Yes," Ralph said, "I know him very little, and I confess I haven'tfacts and items to prove him a villain. But all the same I can't helpfeeling that you're running a grave risk."</p><p>"Marriage is always a grave risk, and his risk's as grave as mine."</p><p>"That's his affair! If he's afraid, let him back out. I wish to God he would."</p><p>Isabel reclined in her chair, folding her arms and gazing a while ather cousin. "I don't think I understand you," she said at last coldly."I don't know what you're talking about."</p><p>"I believed you'd marry a man of more importance."</p><p>Cold, I say, her tone had been, but at this a colour like a flameleaped into her face. "Of more importance to whom? It seems to meenough that one's husband should be of importance to one's self!"</p><p>Ralph blushed as well; his attitude embarrassed him. Physicallyspeaking he proceeded to change it; he straightened himself, thenleaned forward, resting a hand on each knee. He fixed his eyes on theground; he had an air of the most respectful deliberation.</p><p>"I'll tell you in a moment what I mean," he presently said. He feltagitated, intensely eager; now that he had opened the discussion hewished to discharge his mind. But he wished also to be superlativelygentle.</p><p>Isabel waited a little--then she went on with majesty. "Ineverything that makes one care for people Mr. Osmond is pre-eminent.There may be nobler natures, but I've never had the pleasure of meetingone. Mr. Osmond's is the finest I know; he's good enough for me, andinteresting enough, and clever enough. I'm far more struck with what hehas and what he represents than with what he may lack."</p><p>"I had treated myself to a charming vision of your future," Ralphobserved without answering this; "I had amused myself with planning outa high destiny for you. There was to be nothing of this sort in it. Youwere not to come down so easily or so soon."</p><p>"Come down, you say?"</p><p>"Well, that renders my sense of what has happened to you. You seemedto me to be soaring far up in the blue--to be, sailing in the brightlight, over the heads of men. Suddenly some one tosses up a fadedrosebud--a missile that should never have reached you--and straight youdrop to the ground. It hurts me," said Ralph audaciously, "hurts me asif I had fallen myself!"</p><p>The look of pain and bewilderment deepened in his companion's face."I don't understand you in the least," she repeated. "You say youamused yourself with a project for my career--I don't understand that.Don't amuse yourself too much, or I shall think you're doing it at myexpense."</p><p>Ralph shook his head. "I'm not afraid of your not believing that I've had great ideas for you."</p><p>"What do you mean by my soaring and sailing?" she pursued.</p><p>"I've never moved on a higher plane than I'm moving on now. There'snothing higher for a girl than to marry a--a person she likes," saidpoor Isabel, wandering into the didactic.</p><p>"It's your liking the person we speak of that I venture tocriticise, my dear cousin. I should have said that the man for youwould have been a more active, larger, freer sort of nature." Ralphhesitated, then added: "I can't get over the sense that Osmond issomehow--well, small." He had uttered the last word with no greatassurance; he was afraid she would flash out again. But to his surpriseshe was quiet; she had the air of considering.</p><p>"Small?" She made it sound immense.</p><p>"I think he's narrow, selfish. He takes himself so seriously!"</p><p>"He has a great respect for himself; I don't blame him for that," said Isabel. "It makes one more sure to respect others."</p><p>Ralph for a moment felt almost reassured by her reasonable tone.</p><p>"Yes, but everything is relative; one ought to feel one's relation to things--to others. I don't think Mr. Osmond does that."</p><p>"I've chiefly to do with his relation to me. In that he's excellent."</p><p>"He's the incarnation of taste," Ralph went on, thinking hard how hecould best express Gilbert Osmond's sinister attributes without puttinghimself in the wrong by seeming to describe him coarsely. He wished todescribe him impersonally, scientifically. "He judges and measures,approves and condemns, altogether by that."</p><p>"It's a happy thing then that his taste should be exquisite."</p><p>"It's exquisite, indeed, since it has led him to select you as hisbride. But have you ever seen such a taste--a really exquisiteone--ruffled?"</p><p>"I hope it may never be my fortune to fail to gratify my husband's."</p><p>At these words a sudden passion leaped to Ralph's lips. "Ah, that'swilful, that's unworthy of you! You were not meant to be measured inthat way--you were meant for something better than to keep guard overthe sensibilities of a sterile dilettante!"</p><p>Isabel rose quickly and he did the same, so that they stood for amoment looking at each other as if he had flung down a defiance or aninsult. But "You go too far," she simply breathed.</p><p>"I've said what I had on my mind--and I've said it because I love you!"</p><p>Isabel turned pale: was he too on that tiresome list? She had asudden wish to strike him off. "Ah then, you're not disinterested!"</p><p>"I love you, but I love without hope," said Ralph quickly, forcing asmile and feeling that in that last declaration he had expressed morethan he intended.</p><p>Isabel moved away and stood looking into the sunny stillness of thegarden; but after a little she turned back to him. "I'm afraid yourtalk then is the wildness of despair! I don't understand it --but itdoesn't matter. I'm not arguing with you; it's impossible I should;I've only tried to listen to you. I'm much obliged to you forattempting to explain," she said gently, as if the anger with which shehad just sprung up had already subsided. "It's very good of you to tryto warn me, if you're really alarmed; but I won't promise to think ofwhat you've said: I shall forget it as soon as possible. Try and forgetit yourself; you've done your duty, and no man can do more. I can'texplain to you what I feel, what I believe, and I wouldn't if I could."She paused a moment and then went on with an inconsequence that Ralphobserved even in the midst of his eagerness to discover some symptom ofconcession. "I can't enter into your idea of Mr. Osmond; I can't do itjustice, because I see him in quite another way. He's notimportant--no, he's not important; he's a man to whom importance issupremely indifferent. If that's what you mean when you call him'small,' then he's as small as you please. I call that large--it's thelargest thing I know. I won't pretend to argue with you about a personI'm going to marry," Isabel repeated. "I'm not in the least concernedto defend Mr. Osmond; he's not so weak as to need my defence. I shouldthink it would seem strange even to yourself that I should talk of himso quietly and coldly, as if he were any one else. I wouldn't talk ofhim at all to any one but you; and you, after what you've said--I mayjust answer you once for all. Pray, would you wish me to make amercenary marriage--what they call a marriage of ambition? I've onlyone ambition--to be free to follow out a good feeling. I had othersonce, but they've passed away. Do you complain of Mr. Osmond becausehe's not rich? That's just what I like him for. I've fortunately moneyenough; I've never felt so thankful for it as to-day. There have beenmoments when I should like to go and kneel down by your father's grave:he did perhaps a better thing than he knew when he put it into my powerto marry a poor man--a man who has borne his poverty with such dignity,with such indifference. Mr. Osmond has never scrambled norstruggled--he has cared for no worldly prize. If that's to be narrow,if that's to be selfish, then it's very well. I'm not frightened bysuch words, I'm not even displeased; I'm only sorry that you shouldmake a mistake. Others might have done so, but I'm surprised that youshould. You might know a gentleman when you see one--you might know afine mind. Mr. Osmond makes no mistakes! He knows everything, heunderstands everything, he has the kindest, gentlest, highest spirit.You've got hold of some false idea. It's a pity, but I can't help it;it regards you more than me." Isabel paused a moment, looking at hercousin with an eye illumined by a sentiment which contradicted thecareful calmness of her manner--a mingled sentiment, to which the angrypain excited by his words and the wounded pride of having needed tojustify a choice of which she felt only the nobleness and purity,equally contributed. Though she paused Ralph said nothing; he saw shehad more to say. She was grand, but she was highly solicitous; she wasindifferent, but she was all in a passion. "What sort of a personshould you have liked me to marry?" she asked suddenly. "You talk aboutone's soaring and sailing, but if one marries at all one touches theearth. One has human feelings and needs, one has a heart in one'sbosom, and one must marry a particular individual. Your mother hasnever forgiven me for not having come to a better understanding withLord Warburton, and she's horrified at my contenting myself with aperson who has none of his great advantages--no property, no title, nohonours, no houses, nor lands, nor position, nor reputation, norbrilliant belongings of any sort. It's the total absence of all thesethings that pleases me. Mr. Osmond's simply a very lonely, a verycultivated and a very honest man--he's not a prodigious proprietor."</p><p>Ralph had listened with great attention, as if everything she saidmerited deep consideration; but in truth he was only half thinking ofthe things she said, he was for the rest simply accommodating himselfto the weight of his total impression--the impression of her ardentgood faith. She was wrong, but she believed; she was deluded, but shewas dismally consistent. It was wonderfully characteristic of her that,having invented a fine theory, about Gilbert Osmond, she loved him notfor what he really possessed, but for his very poverties dressed out ashonours. Ralph remembered what he had said to his father about wishingto put it into her power to meet the requirements of her imagination.He had done so, and the girl had taken full advantage of the luxury.Poor Ralph felt sick; he felt ashamed. Isabel had uttered her lastwords with a low solemnity of conviction which virtually terminated thediscussion, and she closed it formally by turning away and walking backto the house. Ralph walked beside her, and they passed into the courttogether and reached the big staircase. Here he stopped and Isabelpaused, turning on him a face of elation--absolutely and perversely ofgratitude. His opposition had made her own conception of her conductclearer to her. "Shall you not come up to breakfast?" she asked.</p><p>"No; I want no breakfast; I'm not hungry."</p><p>"You ought to eat," said the girl; "you live on air."</p><p>"I do, very much, and I shall go back into the garden and takeanother mouthful. I came thus far simply to say this. I told you lastyear that if you were to get into trouble I should feel terribly sold.That's how I feel to-day."</p><p>"Do you think I'm in trouble?"</p><p>"One's in trouble when one's in error."</p><p>"Very well," said Isabel; "I shall never complain of my trouble to you!" And she moved up the staircase.</p><p>Ralph, standing there with his hands in his pockets, followed herwith his eyes; then the lurking chill of the high-walled court struckhim and made him shiver, so that he returned to the garden to breakfaston the Florentine sunshine.</p></span><span id = 984 ><p>Isabel, when she strolled in the Cascine with her lover, felt noimpulse to tell him how little he was approved at Palazzo Crescentini.The discreet opposition offered to her marriage by her aunt and hercousin made on the whole no great impression upon her; the moral of itwas simply that they disliked Gilbert Osmond. This dislike was notalarming to Isabel; she scarcely even regretted it; for it servedmainly to throw into higher relief the fact, in every way sohonourable, that she married to please herself. One did other things toplease other people; one did this for a more personal satisfaction; andIsabel's satisfaction was confirmed by her lover's admirable goodconduct. Gilbert Osmond was in love, and he had never deserved lessthan during these still, bright days, each of them numbered, whichpreceded the fulfilment of his hopes, the harsh criticism passed uponhim by Ralph Touchett. The chief impression produced on Isabel's spiritby this criticism was that the passion of love separated its victimterribly from every one but the loved object. She felt herselfdisjoined from every one she had ever known before--from her twosisters, who wrote to express a dutiful hope that she would be happy,and a surprise, somewhat more vague, at her not having chosen a consortwho was the hero of a richer accumulation of anecdote; from Henrietta,who, she was sure, would come out, too late, on purpose to remonstrate;from Lord Warburton, who would certainly console himself, and fromCaspar Goodwood, who perhaps would not; from her aunt, who had cold,shallow ideas about marriage, for which she was not sorry to displayher contempt; and from Ralph, whose talk about having great views forher was surely but a whimsical cover for a personal disappointment.Ralph apparently wished her not to marry at all--that was what itreally meant--because he was amused with the spectacle of heradventures as a single woman. His disappointment made him say angrythings about the man she had preferred even to him: Isabel flatteredherself that she believed Ralph had been angry. It was the more easyfor her to believe this because, as I say, she had now little free orunemployed emotion for minor needs, and accepted as an incident, infact quite as an ornament, of her lot the idea that to prefer GilbertOsmond as she preferred him was perforce to break all other ties. Shetasted of the sweets of this preference, and they made her conscious,almost with awe, of the invidious and remorseless tide of the charmedand possessed condition, great as was the traditional honour andimputed virtue of being in love. It was the tragic part of happiness;one's right was always made of the wrong of some one else.</p><p>The elation of success, which surely now flamed high in Osmond,emitted meanwhile very little smoke for so brilliant a blaze.Contentment, on his part, took no vulgar form; excitement, in the mostself-conscious of men, was a kind of ecstasy of self-control. Thisdisposition, however, made him an admirable lover; it gave him aconstant view of the smitten and dedicated state. He never forgothimself, as I say; and so he never forgot to be graceful and tender, towear the appearance--which presented indeed no difficulty--of stirredsenses and deep intentions. He was immensely pleased with his younglady; Madame Merle had made him a present of incalculable value. Whatcould be a finer thing to live with than a high spirit attuned tosoftness? For would not the softness be all for one's self, and thestrenuousness for society, which admired the air of superiority? Whatcould be a happier gift in a companion than a quick, fanciful mindwhich saved one repetitions and reflected one's thought on a polished,elegant surface? Osmond hated to see his thought reproduced literally--that made it look stale and stupid; he preferred it to be freshened inthe reproduction even as "words" by music. His egotism had never takenthe crude form of desiring a dull wife; this lady's intelligence was tobe a silver plate, not an earthen one--a plate that he might heap upwith ripe fruits, to which it would give a decorative value, so thattalk might become for him a sort of served dessert. He found the silverquality in this perfection in Isabel; he could tap her imagination withhis knuckle and make it ring. He knew perfectly, though he had not beentold, that their union enjoyed little favour with the girl's relations;but he had always treated her so completely as an independent personthat it hardly seemed necessary to express regret for the attitude ofher family. Nevertheless, one morning, he made an abrupt allusion toit. "It's the difference in our fortune they don't like," he said."They think I'm in love with your money."</p><p>"Are you speaking of my aunt--of my cousin?" Isabel asked. "How do you know what they think?"</p><p>"You've not told me they're pleased, and when I wrote to Mrs.Touchett the other day she never answered my note. If they had beendelighted I should have had some sign of it, and the fact of my beingpoor and you rich is the most obvious explanation of their reserve. Butof course when a poor man marries a rich girl he must be prepared forimputations. I don't mind them; I only care for one thing--for your nothaving the shadow of a doubt. I don't care what people of whom I asknothing think--I'm not even capable perhaps of wanting to know. I'venever so concerned myself, God forgive me, and why should I beginto-day, when I have taken to myself a compensation for everything? Iwon't pretend I'm sorry you're rich; I'm delighted. I delight ineverything that's yours--whether it be money or virtue. Money's ahorrid thing to follow, but a charming thing to meet. It seems to me,however, that I've sufficiently proved the limits of my itch for it: Inever in my life tried to earn a penny, and I ought to be less subjectto suspicion than most of the people one sees grubbing and grabbing. Isuppose it's their business to suspect--that of your family; it'sproper on the whole they should. They'll like me better some day; sowill you, for that matter. Meanwhile my business is not to make myselfbad blood, but simply to be thankful for life and love." "It has mademe better, loving you," he said on another occasion; "it has made mewiser and easier and--I won't pretend to deny--brighter and nicer andeven stronger. I used to want a great many things before and to beangry I didn't have them. Theoretically I was satisfied, as I once toldyou. I flattered myself I had limited my wants. But I was subject toirritation; I used to have morbid, sterile, hateful fits of hunger, ofdesire. Now I'm really satisfied, because I can't think of anythingbetter. It's just as when one has been trying to spell out a book inthe twilight and suddenly the lamp comes in. I had been putting out myeyes over the book of life and finding nothing to reward me for mypains; but now that I can read it properly I see it's a delightfulstory. My dear girl, I can't tell you how life seems to stretch therebefore us--what a long summer afternoon awaits us. It's the latter halfof an Italian day --with a golden haze, and the shadows justlengthening, and that divine delicacy in the light, the air, thelandscape, which I have loved all my life and which you love to-day.Upon my honour, I don't see why we shouldn't get on. We've got what welike--to say nothing of having each other. We've the faculty ofadmiration and several capital convictions. We're not stupid, we're notmean, we're not under bonds to any kind of ignorance or dreariness.You're remarkably fresh, and I'm remarkably well-seasoned. We've mypoor child to amuse us; we'll try and make up some little life for her.It's all soft and mellow--it has the Italian colouring."</p><p>They made a good many plans, but they left themselves also a gooddeal of latitude; it was a matter of course, however, that they shouldlive for the present in Italy. It was in Italy that they had met, Italyhad been a party to their first impressions of each other, and Italyshould be a party to their happiness. Osmond had the attachment of oldacquaintance and Isabel the stimulus of new, which seemed to assure hera future at a high level of consciousness of the beautiful. The desirefor unlimited expansion had been succeeded in her soul by the sensethat life was vacant without some private duty that might gather one'senergies to a point. She had told Ralph she had "seen life" in a yearor two and that she was already tired, not of the act of living, but ofthat of observing. What had become of all her ardours, her aspirations,her theories, her high estimate of her independence and her incipientconviction that she should never marry? These things had been absorbedin a more primitive need-- a need the answer to which brushed awaynumberless questions, yet gratified infinite desires. It simplified thesituation at a stroke, it came down from above like the light of thestars, and it needed no explanation. There was explanation enough inthe fact that he was her lover, her own, and that she should be able tobe of use to him. She could surrender to him with a kind of humility,she could marry him with a kind of pride; she was not only taking, shewas giving.</p><p>He brought Pansy with him two or three times to the Cascine-- Pansywho was very little taller than a year before, and not much older. Thatshe would always be a child was the conviction expressed by her father,who held her by the hand when she was in her sixteenth year and toldher to go and play while he sat down a little with the pretty lady.Pansy wore a short dress and a long coat; her hat always seemed too bigfor her. She found pleasure in walking off, with quick, short steps, tothe end of the alley, and then in walking back with a smile that seemedan appeal for approbation. Isabel approved in abundance, and theabundance had the personal touch that the child's affectionate naturecraved. She watched her indications as if for herself also muchdepended on them--Pansy already so represented part of the service shecould render, part of the responsibility she could face. Her fathertook so the childish view of her that he had not yet explained to herthe new relation in which he stood to the elegant Miss Archer. "Shedoesn't know," he said to Isabel; "she doesn't guess; she thinks itperfectly natural that you and I should come and walk here togethersimply as good friends. There seems to me something enchantinglyinnocent in that; it's the way I like her to be. No, I'm not a failure,as I used to think; I've succeeded in two things. I'm to marry thewoman I adore, and I've brought up my child, as I wished, in the oldway."</p><p>He was very fond, in all things, of the "old way"; that had struckIsabel as one of his fine, quiet, sincere notes. "It occurs to me thatyou'll not know whether you've succeeded until you've told her," shesaid. "You must see how she takes your news, She may be horrified--shemay be jealous."</p><p>"I'm not afraid of that; she's too fond of you on her own account. Ishould like to leave her in the dark a little longer --to see if itwill come into her head that if we're not engaged we ought to be."</p><p>Isabel was impressed by Osmond's artistic, the plastic view, as itsomehow appeared, of Pansy's innocence--her own appreciation of itbeing more anxiously moral. She was perhaps not the less pleased whenhe told her a few days later that he had communicated the fact to hisdaughter, who had made such a pretty little speech--"Oh, then I shallhave a beautiful sister!" She was neither surprised nor alarmed; shehad not cried, as he expected.</p><p>"Perhaps she had guessed it," said Isabel.</p><p>"Don't say that; I should be disgusted if I believed that. I thoughtit would be just a little shock; but the way she took it proves thather good manners are paramount. That's also what I wished. You shallsee for yourself; to-morrow she shall make you her congratulations inperson."</p><p>The meeting, on the morrow, took place at the Countess Gemini's,whither Pansy had been conducted by her father, who knew that Isabelwas to come in the afternoon to return a visit made her by the Countesson learning that they were to become sisters-in-law. Calling at CasaTouchett the visitor had not found Isabel at home; but after our youngwoman had been ushered into the Countess's drawing-room Pansy arrivedto say that her aunt would presently appear. Pansy was spending the daywith that lady, who thought her of an age to begin to learn how tocarry herself in company. It was Isabel's view that the little girlmight have given lessons in deportment to her relative, and nothingcould have justified this conviction more than the manner in whichPansy acquitted herself while they waited together for the Countess.Her father's decision, the year before, had finally been to send herback to the convent to receive the last graces, and Madame Catherinehad evidently carried out her theory that Pansy was to be fitted forthe great world.</p><p>"Papa has told me that you've kindly consented to marry him," saidthis excellent woman's pupil. "It's very delightful; I think you'llsuit very well."</p><p>"You think I shall suit YOU?"</p><p>"You'll suit me beautifully; but what I mean is that you and papawill suit each other. You're both so quiet and so serious. You're notso quiet as he--or even as Madame Merle; but you're more quiet thanmany others. He should not for instance have a wife like my aunt. She'salways in motion, in agitation--to-day especially; you'll see when shecomes in. They told us at the convent it was wrong to judge our elders,but I suppose there's no harm if we judge them favourably. You'll be adelightful companion for papa."</p><p>"For you too, I hope," Isabel said.</p><p>"I speak first of him on purpose. I've told you already what Imyself think of you; I liked you from the first. I admire you so muchthat I think it will be a good fortune to have you always before me.You'll be my model; I shall try to imitate you though I'm afraid itwill be very feeble. I'm very glad for papa--he needed something morethan me. Without you I don't see how he could have got it. You'll be mystepmother, but we mustn't use that word. They're always said to becruel; but I don't think you'll ever so much as pinch or even push me.I'm not afraid at all."</p><p>"My good little Pansy," said Isabel gently, "I shall be ever so kindto you." A vague, inconsequent vision of her coming in some odd way toneed it had intervened with the effect of a chill.</p><p>"Very well then, I've nothing to fear," the child returned with hernote of prepared promptitude. What teaching she had had, it seemed tosuggest--or what penalties for non-performance she dreaded!</p><p>Her description of her aunt had not been incorrect; the CountessGemini was further than ever from having folded her wings. She enteredthe room with a flutter through the air and kissed Isabel first on theforehead and then on each cheek as if according to some ancientprescribed rite. She drew the visitor to a sofa and, looking at herwith a variety of turns of the head, began to talk very much as if,seated brush in hand before an easel, she were applying a series ofconsidered touches to a composition of figures already sketched in. "Ifyou expect me to congratulate you I must beg you to excuse me. I don'tsuppose you care if I do or not; I believe you're supposed not tocare--through being so clever--for all sorts of ordinary things. But Icare myself if I tell fibs; I never tell them unless there's somethingrather good to be gained. I don't see what's to be gained with you--especially as you wouldn't believe me. I don't make professions anymore than I make paper flowers or flouncey lampshades--I don't knowhow. My lampshades would be sure to take fire, my roses and my fibs tobe larger than life. I'm very glad for my own sake that you're to marryOsmond; but I won't pretend I'm glad for yours. You're verybrilliant--you know that's the way you're always spoken of; you're anheiress and very good-looking and original, not banal; so it's a goodthing to have you in the family. Our family's very good, you know;Osmond will have told you that; and my mother was ratherdistinguished--she was called the American Corinne. But we'redreadfully fallen, I think, and perhaps you'll pick us up. I've greatconfidence in you; there are ever so many things I want to talk to youabout. I never congratulate any girl on marrying; I think they ought tomake it somehow not quite so awful a steel trap. I suppose Pansyoughtn't to hear all this; but that's what she has come to me for --toacquire the tone of society. There's no harm in her knowing whathorrors she may be in for. When first I got an idea that my brother haddesigns on you I thought of writing to you, to recommend you, in thestrongest terms, not to listen to him. Then I thought it would bedisloyal, and I hate anything of that kind. Besides, as I say, I wasenchanted for myself; and after all I'm very selfish. By the way, youwon't respect me, not one little mite, and we shall never be intimate.I should like it, but you won't. Some day, all the same, we shall bebetter friends than you will believe at first. My husband will come andsee you, though, as you probably know, he's on no sort of terms withOsmond. He's very fond of going to see pretty women, but I'm not afraidof you. In the first place I don't care what he does. In the second,you won't care a straw for him; he won't be a bit, at any time, youraffair, and, stupid as he is, he'll see you're not his. Some day, ifyou can stand it, I'll tell you all about him. Do you think my nieceought to go out of the room? Pansy, go and practise a little in myboudoir."</p><p>"Let her stay, please," said Isabel. "I would rather hear nothing that Pansy may not!"</p></span><span id = 985 ><p>One afternoon of the autumn of 1876, toward dusk, a young man ofpleasing appearance rang at the door of a small apartment on the thirdfloor of an old Roman house. On its being opened he enquired for MadameMerle; whereupon the servant, a neat, plain woman, with a French faceand a lady's maid's manner, ushered him into a diminutive drawing-roomand requested the favour of his name. "Mr. Edward Rosier," said theyoung man, who sat down to wait till his hostess should appear.</p><p>The reader will perhaps not have forgotten that Mr. Rosier was anornament of the American circle in Paris, but it may also be rememberedthat he sometimes vanished from its horizon. He had spent a portion ofseveral winters at Pau, and as he was a gentleman of constituted habitshe might have continued for years to pay his annual visit to thischarming resort. In the summer of 1876, however, an incident befell himwhich changed the current not only of his thoughts, but of hiscustomary sequences. He passed a month in the Upper Engadine andencountered at Saint Moritz a charming young girl. To this littleperson he began to pay, on the spot, particular attention: she struckhim as exactly the household angel he had long been looking for. He wasnever precipitate, he was nothing if not discreet, so he forbore forthe present to declare his passion; but it seemed to him when theyparted--the young lady to go down into Italy and her admirer to proceedto Geneva, where he was under bonds to join other friends--that heshould be romantically wretched if he were not to see her again. Thesimplest way to do so was to go in the autumn to Rome, where MissOsmond was domiciled with her family. Mr. Rosier started on hispilgrimage to the Italian capital and reached it on the first ofNovember. It was a pleasant thing to do, but for the young man therewas a strain of the heroic in the enterprise. He might expose himself,unseasoned, to the poison of the Roman air, which in November lay,notoriously, much in wait. Fortune, however, favours the brave; andthis adventurer, who took three grains of quinine a day, had at the endof a month no cause to deplore his temerity. He had made to a certainextent good use of his time; he had devoted it in vain to finding aflaw in Pansy Osmond's composition. She was admirably finished; she hadhad the last touch; she was really a consummate piece. He thought ofher in amorous meditation a good deal as he might have thought of aDresden-china shepherdess. Miss Osmond, indeed, in the bloom of herjuvenility, had a hint of the rococo which Rosier, whose taste waspredominantly for that manner, could not fail to appreciate. That heesteemed the productions of comparatively frivolous periods would havebeen apparent from the attention he bestowed upon Madame Merle'sdrawing-room, which, although furnished with specimens of every style,was especially rich in articles of the last two centuries. He hadimmediately put a glass into one eye and looked round; and then "ByJove, she has some jolly good things!" he had yearningly murmured. Theroom was small and densely filled with furniture; it gave an impressionof faded silk and little statuettes which might totter if one moved.Rosier got up and wandered about with his careful tread, bending overthe tables charged with knick-knacks and the cushions embossed withprincely arms. When Madame Merle came in she found him standing beforethe fireplace with his nose very close to the great lace flounceattached to the damask cover of the mantel. He had lifted itdelicately, as if he were smelling it.</p><p>"It's old Venetian," she said; "it's rather good."</p><p>"It's too good for this; you ought to wear it."</p><p>"They tell me you have some better in Paris, in the same situation."</p><p>"Ah, but I can't wear mine," smiled the visitor.</p><p>"I don't see why you shouldn't! I've better lace than that to wear."</p><p>His eyes wandered, lingeringly, round the room again. "You've some very good things."</p><p>"Yes, but I hate them."</p><p>"Do you want to get rid of them?" the young man quickly asked.</p><p>"No, it's good to have something to hate: one works it off!"</p><p>"I love my things," said Mr. Rosier as he sat there flushed with allhis recognitions. "But it's not about them, nor about yours, that Icame to talk to you." He paused a moment and then, with greatersoftness: "I care more for Miss Osmond than for all the bibelots inEurope!"</p><p>Madame Merle opened wide eyes. "Did you come to tell me that?"</p><p>"I came to ask your advice."</p><p>She looked at him with a friendly frown, stroking her chin with herlarge white hand. "A man in love, you know, doesn't ask advice."</p><p>"Why not, if he's in a difficult position? That's often the casewith a man in love. I've been in love before, and I know. But never somuch as this time--really never so much. I should like particularly toknow what you think of my prospects. I'm afraid that for Mr. Osmond I'mnot--well, a real collector's piece."</p><p>"Do you wish me to intercede?" Madame Merle asked with her fine arms folded and her handsome mouth drawn up to the left.</p><p>"If you could say a good word for me I should be greatly obliged.There will be no use in my troubling Miss Osmond unless I have goodreason to believe her father will consent."</p><p>"You're very considerate; that's in your favour. But you assume in rather an off-hand way that I think you a prize."</p><p>"You've been very kind to me," said the young man. "That's why I came."</p><p>"I'm always kind to people who have good Louis Quatorze. It's veryrare now, and there's no telling what one may get by it." With whichthe left-hand corner of Madame Merle's mouth gave expression to thejoke.</p><p>But he looked, in spite of it, literally apprehensive and consistently strenuous. "Ah, I thought you liked me for myself!"</p><p>"I like you very much; but, if you please, we won't analyse. Pardonme if I seem patronising, but I think you a perfect little gentleman. Imust tell you, however, that I've not the marrying of Pansy Osmond."</p><p>"I didn't suppose that. But you've seemed to me intimate with her family, and I thought you might have influence."</p><p>Madame Merle considered. "Whom do you call her family?"</p><p>"Why, her father; and--how do you say it in English?--her belle-mere."</p><p>"Mr. Osmond's her father, certainly; but his wife can scarcely betermed a member of her family. Mrs. Osmond has nothing to do withmarrying her."</p><p>"I'm sorry for that," said Rosier with an amiable sigh of good faith. "I think Mrs. Osmond would favour me."</p><p>"Very likely--if her husband doesn't."</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. "Does she take the opposite line from him?"</p><p>"In everything. They think quite differently."</p><p>"Well," said Rosier, "I'm sorry for that; but it's none of my business. She's very fond of Pansy."</p><p>"Yes, she's very fond of Pansy."</p><p>"And Pansy has a great affection for her. She has told me how she loves her as if she were her own mother."</p><p>"You must, after all, have had some very intimate talk with the poorchild," said Madame Merle. "Have you declared your sentiments?"</p><p>"Never!" cried Rosier, lifting his neatly-gloved hand. "Never till I've assured myself of those of the parents."</p><p>"You always wait for that? You've excellent principles; you observe the proprieties."</p><p>"I think you're laughing at me," the young man murmured, droppingback in his chair and feeling his small moustache. "I didn't expectthat of you, Madame Merle."</p><p>She shook her head calmly, like a person who saw things as she sawthem. "You don't do me justice. I think your conduct in excellent tasteand the best you could adopt. Yes, that's what I think."</p><p>"I wouldn't agitate her--only to agitate her; I love her too much for that," said Ned Rosier.</p><p>"I'm glad, after all, that you've told me," Madame Merle went on. "Leave it to me a little; I think I can help you."</p><p>"I said you were the person to come to!" her visitor cried with prompt elation.</p><p>"You were very clever," Madame Merle returned more dryly. "When Isay I can help you I mean once assuming your cause to be good. Let usthink a little if it is."</p><p>"I'm awfully decent, you know," said Rosier earnestly. "I won't say I've no faults, but I'll say I've no vices."</p><p>"All that's negative, and it always depends, also, on what peoplecall vices. What's the positive side? What's the virtuous? What haveyou got besides your Spanish lace and your Dresden teacups?"</p><p>"I've a comfortable little fortune--about forty thousand francs ayear. With the talent I have for arranging, we can live beautifully onsuch an income."</p><p>"Beautifully, no. Sufficiently, yes. Even that depends on where you live."</p><p>"Well, in Paris. I would undertake it in Paris."</p><p>Madame Merle's mouth rose to the left. "It wouldn't be famous; you'd have to make use of the teacups, and they'd get broken."</p><p>"We don't want to be famous. If Miss Osmond should have everythingpretty it would be enough. When one's as pretty as she one canafford--well, quite cheap faience. She ought never to wear anything butmuslin--without the sprig," said Rosier reflectively.</p><p>"Wouldn't you even allow her the sprig? She'd be much obliged to you at any rate for that theory."</p><p>"It's the correct one, I assure you; and I'm sure she'd enter into it. She understands all that; that's why I love her."</p><p>"She's a very good little girl, and most tidy--also extremelygraceful. But her father, to the best of my belief, can give hernothing."</p><p>Rosier scarce demurred. "I don't in the least desire that he should.But I may remark, all the same, that he lives like a rich man."</p><p>"The money's his wife's; she brought him a large fortune."</p><p>"Mrs. Osmond then is very fond of her stepdaughter; she may do something."</p><p>"For a love-sick swain you have your eyes about you!" Madame Merle exclaimed with a laugh.</p><p>"I esteem a dot very much. I can do without it, but I esteem it."</p><p>"Mrs. Osmond," Madame Merle went on, "will probably prefer to keep her money for her own children."</p><p>"Her own children? Surely she has none."</p><p>"She may have yet. She had a poor little boy, who died two years ago, six months after his birth. Others therefore may come."</p><p>"I hope they will, if it will make her happy. She's a splendid woman."</p><p>Madame Merle failed to burst into speech. "Ah, about her there'smuch to be said. Splendid as you like! We've not exactly made out thatyou're a parti. The absence of vices is hardly a source of income.</p><p>"Pardon me, I think it may be," said Rosier quite lucidly.</p><p>"You'll be a touching couple, living on your innocence!"</p><p>"I think you underrate me."</p><p>"You're not so innocent as that? Seriously," said Madame Merle, "ofcourse forty thousand francs a year and a nice character are acombination to be considered. I don't say it's to be jumped at, butthere might be a worse offer. Mr. Osmond, however, will probablyincline to believe he can do better."</p><p>"HE can do so perhaps; but what can his daughter do? She can't dobetter than marry the man she loves. For she does, you know," Rosieradded eagerly.</p><p>"She does--I know it."</p><p>"Ah," cried the young man, "I said you were the person to come to."</p><p>"But I don't know how you know it, if you haven't asked her," Madame Merle went on.</p><p>"In such a case there's no need of asking and telling; as you say, we're an innocent couple. How did YOU know it?"</p><p>"I who am not innocent? By being very crafty. Leave it to me; I'll find out for you."</p><p>Rosier got up and stood smoothing his hat. "You say that rathercoldly. Don't simply find out how it is, but try to make it as itshould be."</p><p>"I'll do my best. I'll try to make the most of your advantages."</p><p>"Thank you so very much. Meanwhile then I'll say a word to Mrs. Osmond."</p><p>"Gardez-vous-en bien!" And Madame Merle was on her feet. "Don't set her going, or you'll spoil everything."</p><p>Rosier gazed into his hat; he wondered whether his hostess HAD beenafter all the right person to come to. "I don't think I understand you.I'm an old friend of Mrs. Osmond, and I think she would like me tosucceed."</p><p>"Be an old friend as much as you like; the more old friends she hasthe better, for she doesn't get on very well with some of her new. Butdon't for the present try to make her take up the cudgels for you. Herhusband may have other views, and, as a person who wishes her well, Iadvise you not to multiply points of difference between them."</p><p>Poor Rosier's face assumed an expression of alarm; a suit for thehand of Pansy Osmond was even a more complicated business than histaste for proper transitions had allowed. But the extreme good sensewhich he concealed under a surface suggesting that of a careful owner's"best set" came to his assistance. "I don't see that I'm bound toconsider Mr. Osmond so very much!" he exclaimed. "No, but you shouldconsider HER. You say you're an old friend. Would you make her suffer?"</p><p>"Not for the world."</p><p>"Then be very careful, and let the matter alone till I've taken a few soundings."</p><p>"Let the matter alone, dear Madame Merle? Remember that I'm in love."</p><p>"Oh, you won't burn up! Why did you come to me, if you're not to heed what I say?"</p><p>"You're very kind; I'll be very good," the young man promised. "ButI'm afraid Mr. Osmond's pretty hard," he added in his mild voice as hewent to the door.</p><p>Madame Merle gave a short laugh. "It has been said before. But his wife isn't easy either."</p><p>"Ah, she's a splendid woman!" Ned Rosier repeated, for departure. Heresolved that his conduct should be worthy of an aspirant who wasalready a model of discretion; but he saw nothing in any pledge he hadgiven Madame Merle that made it improper he should keep himself inspirits by an occasional visit to Miss Osmond's home. He reflectedconstantly on what his adviser had said to him, and turned over in hismind the impression of her rather circumspect tone. He had gone to herde confiance, as they put it in Paris; but it was possible he had beenprecipitate. He found difficulty in thinking of himself as rash--he hadincurred this reproach so rarely; but it certainly was true that he hadknown Madame Merle only for the last month, and that his thinking her adelightful woman was not, when one came to look into it, a reason forassuming that she would be eager to push Pansy Osmond into his arms,gracefully arranged as these members might be to receive her. She hadindeed shown him benevolence, and she was a person of considerationamong the girl's people, where she had a rather striking appearance(Rosier had more than once wondered how she managed it) of beingintimate without being familiar. But possibly he had exaggerated theseadvantages. There was no particular reason why she should take troublefor him; a charming woman was charming to every one, and Rosier feltrather a fool when he thought of his having appealed to her on theground that she had distinguished him. Very likely--though she hadappeared to say it in joke--she was really only thinking of hisbibelots. Had it come into her head that he might offer her two orthree of the gems of his collection? If she would only help him tomarry Miss Osmond he would present her with his whole museum. He couldhardly say so to her outright; it would seem too gross a bribe. But heshould like her to believe it.</p><p>It was with these thoughts that he went again to Mrs. Osmond's, Mrs.Osmond having an "evening"--she had taken the Thursday of eachweek--when his presence could be accounted for on general principles ofcivility. The object of Mr. Rosier's well-regulated affection dwelt ina high house in the very heart of Rome; a dark and massive structureoverlooking a sunny piazzetta in the neighbourhood of the FarnesePalace. In a palace, too, little Pansy lived--a palace by Romanmeasure, but a dungeon to poor Rosier's apprehensive mind. It seemed tohim of evil omen that the young lady he wished to marry, and whosefastidious father he doubted of his ability to conciliate, should beimmured in a kind of domestic fortress, a pile which bore a stern oldRoman name, which smelt of historic deeds, of crime and craft andviolence, which was mentioned in "Murray" and visited by tourists wholooked, on a vague survey, disappointed and depressed, and which hadfrescoes by Caravaggio in the piano nobile and a row of mutilatedstatues and dusty urns in the wide, nobly-arched loggia overhanging thedamp court where a fountain gushed out of a mossy niche. In a lesspreoccupied frame of mind he could have done justice to the PalazzoRoccanera; he could have entered into the sentiment of Mrs. Osmond, whohad once told him that on settling themselves in Rome she and herhusband had chosen this habitation for the love of local colour. It hadlocal colour enough, and though he knew less about architecture thanabout Limoges enamels he could see that the proportions of the windowsand even the details of the cornice had quite the grand air. But Rosierwas haunted by the conviction that at picturesque periods young girlshad been shut up there to keep them from their true loves, and hen,under the threat of being thrown into convents, had been forced intounholy marriages. There was one point, however, to which he always didjustice when once he found himself in Mrs. Osmond's warm, rich-lookingreception-rooms, which were on the second floor. He acknowledged thatthese people were very strong in "good things." It was a taste ofOsmond's own--not at all of hers; this she had told him the first timehe came to the house, when, after asking himself for a quarter of anhour whether they had even better "French" than he in Paris, he wasobliged on the spot to admit that they had, very much, and vanquishedhis envy, as a gentleman should, to the point of expressing to hishostess his pure admiration of her treasures. He learned from Mrs.Osmond that her husband had made a large collection before theirmarriage and that, though he had annexed a number of fine pieces withinthe last three years, he had achieved his greatest finds at a time whenhe had not the advantage of her advice. Rosier interpreted thisinformation according to principles of his own. For "advice" read"cash," he said to himself; and the fact that Gilbert Osmond had landedhis highest prizes during his impecunious season confirmed his mostcherished doctrine--the doctrine that a collector may freely be poor ifhe be only patient. In general, when Rosier presented himself on aThursday evening, his first recognition was for the walls of thesaloon; there were three or four objects his eyes really yearned for.But after his talk with Madame Merle he felt the extreme seriousness ofhis position; and now, when he came in, he looked about for thedaughter of the house with such eagerness as might be permitted agentleman whose smile, as he crossed a threshold, always tookeverything comfortable for granted.</p></span><span id = 986 ><p>Pansy was not in the first of the rooms, a large apartment with aconcave ceiling and walls covered with old red damask; it was here Mrs.Osmond usually sat--though she was not in her most customary placeto-night--and that a circle of more especial intimates gathered aboutthe fire. The room was flushed with subdued, diffused brightness; itcontained the larger things and--almost always--an odour of flowers.Pansy on this occasion was presumably in the next of the series, theresort of younger visitors, where tea was served. Osmond stood beforethe chimney, leaning back with his hands behind him; he had one foot upand was warming the sole. Half a dozen persons, scattered near him,were talking together; but he was not in the conversation; his eyes hadan expression, frequent with them, that seemed to represent them asengaged with objects more worth their while than the appearancesactually thrust upon them. Rosier, coming in unannounced, failed toattract his attention; but the young man, who was very punctilious,though he was even exceptionally conscious that it was the wife, notthe husband, he had come to see, went up to shake hands with him.Osmond put out his left hand, without changing his attitude.</p><p>"How d'ye do? My wife's somewhere about."</p><p>"Never fear; I shall find her," said Rosier cheerfully.</p><p>Osmond, however, took him in; he had never in his life felt himselfso efficiently looked at. "Madame Merle has told him, and he doesn'tlike it," he privately reasoned. He had hoped Madame Merle would bethere, but she was not in sight; perhaps she was in one of the otherrooms or would come later. He had never especially delighted in GilbertOsmond, having a fancy he gave himself airs. But Rosier was not quicklyresentful, and where politeness was concerned had ever a strong need ofbeing quite in the right. He looked round him and smiled, all withouthelp, and then in a moment, "I saw a jolly good piece of Capo di Monteto-day," he said.</p><p>Osmond answered nothing at first; but presently, while he warmed hisboot-sole, "I don't care a fig for Capo di Monte!" he returned.</p><p>"I hope you're not losing your interest?"</p><p>"In old pots and plates? Yes, I'm losing my interest."</p><p>Rosier for an instant forgot the delicacy of his position. "You're not thinking of parting with a--a piece or two?"</p><p>"No, I'm not thinking of parting with anything at all, Mr. Rosier," said Osmond, with his eyes still on the eyes of his visitor.</p><p>"Ah, you want to keep, but not to add," Rosier remarked brightly.</p><p>"Exactly. I've nothing I wish to match."</p><p>Poor Rosier was aware he had blushed; he was distressed at his wantof assurance. "Ah, well, I have!" was all he could murmur; and he knewhis murmur was partly lost as he turned away. He took his course to theadjoining room and met Mrs. Osmond coming out of the deep doorway. Shewas dressed in black velvet; she looked high and splendid, as he hadsaid, and yet oh so radiantly gentle! We know what Mr. Rosier thoughtof her and the terms in which, to Madame Merle, he had expressed hisadmiration. Like his appreciation of her dear little stepdaughter itwas based partly on his eye for decorative character, his instinct forauthenticity; but also on a sense for uncatalogued values, for thatsecret of a "lustre" beyond any recorded losing or rediscovering, whichhis devotion to brittle wares had still not disqualified him torecognise. Mrs. Osmond, at present, might well have gratified suchtastes. The years had touched her only to enrich her; the flower of heryouth had not faded, it only hung more quietly on its stem. She hadlost something of that quick eagerness to which her husband hadprivately taken exception--she had more the air of being able to wait.Now, at all events, framed in the gilded doorway, she struck our youngman as the picture of a gracious lady. "You see I'm very regular," hesaid. "But who should be if I'm not?"</p><p>"Yes, I've known you longer than any one here. But we mustn'tindulge in tender reminiscences. I want to introduce you to a younglady."</p><p>"Ah, please, what young lady?" Rosier was immensely obliging; but this was not what he had come for.</p><p>"She sits there by the fire in pink and has no one to speak to."Rosier hesitated a moment. "Can't Mr. Osmond speak to her? He's withinsix feet of her."</p><p>Mrs. Osmond also hesitated. "She's not very lively, and he doesn't like dull people."</p><p>"But she's good enough for me? Ah now, that's hard!"</p><p>"I only mean that you've ideas for two. And then you're so obliging."</p><p>"No, he's not--to me." And Mrs. Osmond vaguely smiled.</p><p>"That's a sign he should be doubly so to other women.</p><p>"So I tell him," she said, still smiling.</p><p>"You see I want some tea," Rosier went on, looking wistfully beyond.</p><p>"That's perfect. Go and give some to my young lady."</p><p>"Very good; but after that I'll abandon her to her fate. The simple truth is I'm dying to have a little talk with Miss Osmond."</p><p>"Ah," said Isabel, turning away, "I can't help you there!"</p><p>Five minutes later, while he handed a tea-cup to the damsel in pink,whom he had conducted into the other room, he wondered whether, inmaking to Mrs. Osmond the profession I have just quoted, he had brokenthe spirit of his promise to Madame Merle. Such a question was capableof occupying this young man's mind for a considerable time. At last,however, he became-- comparatively speaking--reckless; he cared littlewhat promises he might break. The fate to which he had threatened toabandon the damsel in pink proved to be none so terrible; for PansyOsmond, who had given him the tea for his companion--Pansy was as fondas ever of making tea--presently came and talked to her. Into this mildcolloquy Edward Rosier entered little; he sat by moodily, watching hissmall sweetheart. If we look at her now through his eyes we shall atfirst not see much to remind us of the obedient little girl who, atFlorence, three years before, was sent to walk short distances in theCascine while her father and Miss Archer talked together of matterssacred to elder people. But after a moment we shall perceive that if atnineteen Pansy has become a young lady she doesn't really fill out thepart; that if she has grown very pretty she lacks in a deplorabledegree the quality known and esteemed in the appearance of females asstyle; and that if she is dressed with great freshness she wears hersmart attire with an undisguised appearance of saving it--very much asif it were lent her for the occasion. Edward Rosier, it would seem,would have been just the man to note these defects; and in point offact there was not a quality of this young lady, of any sort, that hehad not noted. Only he called her qualities by names of his own--someof which indeed were happy enough. "No, she's unique--she's absolutelyunique," he used to say to himself; and you may be sure that not for aninstant would he have admitted to you that she was wanting in style.Style? Why, she had the style of a little princess; if you couldn't seeit you had no eye. It was not modern, it was not conscious, it wouldproduce no impression in Broadway; the small, serious damsel, in herstiff little dress, only looked like an Infanta of Velasquez. This wasenough for Edward Rosier, who thought her delightfully old-fashioned.Her anxious eyes, her charming lips, her slip of a figure, were astouching as a childish prayer. He had now an acute desire to know justto what point she liked him--a desire which made him fidget as he satin his chair. It made him feel hot, so that he had to pat his foreheadwith his handkerchief; he had never been so uncomfortable. She was sucha perfect jeune fille, and one couldn't make of a jeune fille theenquiry requisite for throwing light on such a point. A jeune fille waswhat Rosier had always dreamed of--a jeune fille who should yet not beFrench, for he had felt that this nationality would complicate thequestion. He was sure Pansy had never looked at a newspaper and that,in the way of novels, if she had read Sir Walter Scott it was the verymost. An American jeune fille--what could be better than that? Shewould be frank and gay, and yet would not have walked alone, nor havereceived letters from men, nor have been taken to the theatre to seethe comedy of manners. Rosier could not deny that, as the matter stood,it would be a breach of hospitality to appeal directly to thisunsophisticated creature; but he was now in imminent danger of askinghimself if hospitality were the most sacred thing in the world. Was notthe sentiment that he entertained for Miss Osmond of infinitely greaterimportance? Of greater importance to him--yes; but not probably to themaster of the house. There was one comfort; even if this gentleman hadbeen placed on his guard by Madame Merle he would not have extended thewarning to Pansy; it would not have been part of his policy to let herknow that a prepossessing young man was in love with her. But he WAS inlove with her, the prepossessing young man; and all these restrictionsof circumstance had ended by irritating him. What had Gilbert Osmondmeant by giving him two fingers of his left hand? If Osmond was rude,surely he himself might be bold. He felt extremely bold after the dullgirl in so vain a disguise of rose-colour had responded to the call ofher mother, who came in to say, with a significant simper at Rosier,that she must carry her off to other triumphs. The mother and daughterdeparted together, and now it depended only upon him that he should bevirtually alone with Pansy. He had never been alone with her before; hehad never been alone with a jeune fille. It was a great moment; poorRosier began to pat his forehead again. There was another room beyondthe one in which they stood--a small room that had been thrown open andlighted, but that, the company not being numerous, had remained emptyall the evening. It was empty yet; it was upholstered in pale yellow;there were several lamps; through the open door it looked the verytemple of authorised love. Rosier gazed a moment through this aperture;he was afraid that Pansy would run away, and felt almost capable ofstretching out a hand to detain her. But she lingered where the othermaiden had left them, making no motion to join a knot of visitors onthe far side of the room. For a little it occurred to him that she wasfrightened--too frightened perhaps to move; but a second glance assuredhim she was not, and he then reflected that she was too innocent indeedfor that. After a supreme hesitation he asked her if he might go andlook at the yellow room, which seemed so attractive yet so virginal. Hehad been there already with Osmond, to inspect the furniture, which wasof the First French Empire, and especially to admire the clock (whichhe didn't really admire), an immense classic structure of that period.He therefore felt that he had now begun to manoeuvre.</p><p>"Certainly, you may go," said Pansy; "and if you like I'll show you." She was not in the least frightened.</p><p>"That's just what I hoped you'd say; you're so very kind," Rosier murmured.</p><p>They went in together; Rosier really thought the room very ugly, andit seemed cold. The same idea appeared to have struck Pansy. "It's notfor winter evenings; it's more for summer," she said. "It's papa'staste; he has so much."</p><p>He had a good deal, Rosier thought; but some of it was very bad. Helooked about him; he hardly knew what to say in such a situation."Doesn't Mrs. Osmond care how her rooms are done? Has she no taste?" heasked.</p><p>"Oh yes, a great deal; but it's more for literature," said Pansy--"and for conversation. But papa cares also for those things. I thinkhe knows everything."</p><p>Rosier was silent a little. "There's one thing I'm sure he knows!"he broke out presently. "He knows that when I come here it's, with allrespect to him, with all respect to Mrs. Osmond, who's socharming--it's really," said the young man, "to see you!"</p><p>"To see me?" And Pansy raised her vaguely troubled eyes.</p><p>"To see you; that's what I come for," Rosier repeated, feeling the intoxication of a rupture with authority.</p><p>Pansy stood looking at him, simply, intently, openly; a blush wasnot needed to make her face more modest. "I thought it was for that."</p><p>"And it was not disagreeable to you?"</p><p>"I couldn't tell; I didn't know. You never told me," said Pansy.</p><p>"I was afraid of offending you."</p><p>"You don't offend me," the young girl murmured, smiling as if an angel had kissed her.</p><p>"You like me then, Pansy?" Rosier asked very gently, feeling very happy.</p><p>"Yes--I like you."</p><p>They had walked to the chimney-piece where the big cold Empire clockwas perched; they were well within the room and beyond observation fromwithout. The tone in which she had said these four words seemed to himthe very breath of nature, and his only answer could be to take herhand and hold it a moment. Then he raised it to his lips. Shesubmitted, still with her pure, trusting smile, in which there wassomething ineffably passive. She liked him--she had liked him all thewhile; now anything might happen! She was ready--she had been readyalways, waiting for him to speak. If he had not spoken she would havewaited for ever; but when the word came she dropped like the peach fromthe shaken tree. Rosier felt that if he should draw her toward him andhold her to his heart she would submit without a murmur, would restthere without a question. It was true that this would be a rashexperiment in a yellow Empire salottino. She had known it was for herhe came, and yet like what a perfect little lady she had carried it off!</p><p>"You're very dear to me," he murmured, trying to believe that there was after all such a thing as hospitality.</p><p>She looked a moment at her hand, where he had kissed it. "Did you say papa knows?"</p><p>"You told me just now he knows everything."</p><p>"I think you must make sure," said Pansy.</p><p>"Ah, my dear, when once I'm sure of YOU!" Rosier murmured in herear; whereupon she turned back to the other rooms with a little air ofconsistency which seemed to imply that their appeal should be immediate.</p><p>The other rooms meanwhile had become conscious of the arrival ofMadame Merle, who, wherever she went, produced an impression when sheentered. How she did it the most attentive spectator could not havetold you, for she neither spoke loud, nor laughed profusely, nor movedrapidly, nor dressed with splendour, nor appealed in any appreciablemanner to the audience. Large, fair, smiling, serene, there wassomething in her very tranquillity that diffused itself, and whenpeople looked round it was because of a sudden quiet. On this occasionshe had done the quietest thing she could do; after embracing Mrs.Osmond, which was more striking, she had sat down on a small sofa tocommune with the master of the house. There was a brief exchange ofcommonplaces between these two--they always paid, in public, a certainformal tribute to the commonplace--and then Madame Merle, whose eyeshad been wandering, asked if little Mr. Rosier had come this evening.</p><p>"He came nearly an hour ago--but he has disappeared," Osmond said.</p><p>"And where's Pansy?"</p><p>"In the other room. There are several people there."</p><p>"He's probably among them," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"Do you wish to see him?" Osmond asked in a provokingly pointless tone.</p><p>Madame Merle looked at him a moment; she knew each of his tones tothe eighth of a note. "Yes, I should like to say to him that I've toldyou what he wants, and that it interests you but feebly."</p><p>"Don't tell him that. He'll try to interest me more--which is exactly what I don't want. Tell him I hate his proposal."</p><p>"But you don't hate it."</p><p>"It doesn't signify; I don't love it. I let him see that, myself,this evening; I was rude to him on purpose. That sort of thing's agreat bore. There's no hurry."</p><p>"I'll tell him that you'll take time and think it over."</p><p>"No, don't do that. He'll hang on."</p><p>"If I discourage him he'll do the same."</p><p>"Yes, but in the one case he'll try to talk and explain--which wouldbe exceedingly tiresome. In the other he'll probably hold his tongueand go in for some deeper game. That will leave me quiet. I hatetalking with a donkey."</p><p>"Is that what you call poor Mr. Rosier?"</p><p>"Oh, he's a nuisance--with his eternal majolica."</p><p>Madame Merle dropped her eyes; she had a faint smile. "He's agentleman, he has a charming temper; and, after all, an income of fortythousand francs!"</p><p>"It's misery--'genteel' misery," Osmond broke in. "It's not what I've dreamed of for Pansy."</p><p>"Very good then. He has promised me not to speak to her."</p><p>"Do you believe him?" Osmond asked absentmindedly.</p><p>"Perfectly. Pansy has thought a great deal about him; but I don't suppose you consider that that matters."</p><p>"I don't consider it matters at all; but neither do I believe she has thought of him."</p><p>"That opinion's more convenient," said Madame Merle quietly.</p><p>"Has she told you she's in love with him?"</p><p>"For what do you take her? And for what do you take me?" Madame Merle added in a moment.</p><p>Osmond had raised his foot and was resting his slim ankle on theother knee; he clasped his ankle in his hand familiarly--his long, fineforefinger and thumb could make a ring for it--and gazed a while beforehim. "This kind of thing doesn't find me unprepared. It's what Ieducated her for. It was all for this-- that when such a case shouldcome up she should do what I prefer."</p><p>"I'm not afraid that she'll not do it."</p><p>"Well then, where's the hitch?"</p><p>"I don't see any. But, all the same, I recommend you not to get rid of Mr. Rosier. Keep him on hand; he may be useful."</p><p>"I can't keep him. Keep him yourself."</p><p>"Very good; I'll put him into a corner and allow him so much a day."Madame Merle had, for the most part, while they talked, been glancingabout her; it was her habit in this situation, just as it was her habitto interpose a good many blank-looking pauses. A long drop followed thelast words I have quoted; and before it had ended she saw Pansy comeout of the adjoining room, followed by Edward Rosier. The girl advanceda few steps and then stopped and stood looking at Madame Merle and ather father.</p><p>"He has spoken to her," Madame Merle went on to Osmond.</p><p>Her companion never turned his head. "So much for your belief in his promises. He ought to be horsewhipped."</p><p>"He intends to confess, poor little man!"</p><p>Osmond got up; he had now taken a sharp look at his daughter. "It doesn't matter," he murmured, turning away.</p><p>Pansy after a moment came up to Madame Merle with her little mannerof unfamiliar politeness. This lady's reception of her was not moreintimate; she simply, as she rose from the sofa, gave her a friendlysmile.</p><p>"You're very late," the young creature gently said.</p><p>"My dear child, I'm never later than I intend to be."</p><p>Madame Merle had not got up to be gracious to Pansy; she movedtoward Edward Rosier. He came to meet her and, very quickly, as if toget it off his mind, "I've spoken to her!" he whispered.</p><p>"I know it, Mr. Rosier."</p><p>"Did she tell you?"</p><p>"Yes, she told me. Behave properly for the rest of the evening, andcome and see me to-morrow at a quarter past five." She was severe, andin the manner in which she turned her back to him there was a degree ofcontempt which caused him to mutter a decent imprecation.</p><p>He had no intention of speaking to Osmond; it was neither the timenor the place. But he instinctively wandered toward Isabel, who sattalking with an old lady. He sat down on the other side of her; the oldlady was Italian, and Rosier took for granted she understood noEnglish. "You said just now you wouldn't help me," he began to Mrs.Osmond. "Perhaps you'll feel differently when you know--when youknow--!"</p><p>Isabel met his hesitation. "When I know what?"</p><p>"That she's all right."</p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p>"Well, that we've come to an understanding."</p><p>"She's all wrong," said Isabel. "It won't do."</p><p>Poor Rosier gazed at her half-pleadingly, half-angrily; a suddenflush testified to his sense of injury. "I've never been treated so,"he said. "What is there against me, after all? That's not the way I'musually considered. I could have married twenty times."</p><p>"It's a pity you didn't. I don't mean twenty times, but once,comfortably," Isabel added, smiling kindly. "You're not rich enough forPansy."</p><p>"She doesn't care a straw for one's money."</p><p>"No, but her father does."</p><p>"Ah yes, he has proved that!" cried the young man.</p><p>Isabel got up, turning away from him, leaving her old lady withoutceremony; and he occupied himself for the next ten minutes inpretending to look at Gilbert Osmond's collection of miniatures, whichwere neatly arranged on a series of small velvet screens. But he lookedwithout seeing; his cheek burned; he was too full of his sense ofinjury. It was certain that he had never been treated that way before;he was not used to being thought not good enough. He knew how good hewas, and if such a fallacy had not been so pernicious he could havelaughed at it. He searched again for Pansy, but she had disappeared,and his main desire was now to get out of the house. Before doing so hespoke once more to Isabel; it was not agreeable to him to reflect thathe had just said a rude thing to her--the only point that would nowjustify a low view of him.</p><p>"I referred to Mr. Osmond as I shouldn't have done, a while ago," he began. "But you must remember my situation."</p><p>"I don't remember what you said," she answered coldly.</p><p>"Ah, you're offended, and now you'll never help me."</p><p>She was silent an instant, and then with a change of tone: "It's notthat I won't; I simply can't!" Her manner was almost passionate.</p><p>"If you COULD, just a little, I'd never again speak of your husband save as an angel."</p><p>"The inducement's great," said Isabel gravely--inscrutably, as heafterwards, to himself, called it; and she gave him, straight in theeyes, a look which was also inscrutable. It made him remember somehowthat he had known her as a child; and yet it was keener than he liked,and he took himself off.</p></span><span id = 987 ><p>He went to see Madame Merle on the morrow, and to his surprise shelet him off rather easily. But she made him promise that he would stopthere till something should have been decided. Mr. Osmond had hadhigher expectations; it was very true that as he had no intention ofgiving his daughter a portion such expectations were open to criticismor even, if one would, to ridicule. But she would advise Mr. Rosier notto take that tone; if he would possess his soul in patience he mightarrive at his felicity. Mr. Osmond was not favourable to his suit, butit wouldn't be a miracle if he should gradually come round. Pansy wouldnever defy her father, he might depend on that; so nothing was to begained by precipitation. Mr. Osmond needed to accustom his mind to anoffer of a sort that he had not hitherto entertained, and this resultmust come of itself--it was useless to try to force it. Rosier remarkedthat his own situation would be in the meanwhile the most uncomfortablein the world, and Madame Merle assured him that she felt for him. But,as she justly declared, one couldn't have everything one wanted; shehad learned that lesson for herself. There would be no use in hiswriting to Gilbert Osmond, who had charged her to tell him as much. Hewished the matter dropped for a few weeks and would himself write whenhe should have anything to communicate that it might please Mr. Rosierto hear.</p><p>"He doesn't like your having spoken to Pansy, Ah, he doesn't like it at all," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"I'm perfectly willing to give him a chance to tell me so!"</p><p>"If you do that he'll tell you more than you care to hear. Go to thehouse, for the next month, as little as possible, and leave the rest tome."</p><p>"As little as possible? Who's to measure the possibility?"</p><p>"Let me measure it. Go on Thursday evenings with the rest of theworld, but don't go at all at odd times, and don't fret about Pansy.I'll see that she understands everything. She's a calm little nature;she'll take it quietly."</p><p>Edward Rosier fretted about Pansy a good deal, but he did as he wasadvised, and awaited another Thursday evening before returning toPalazzo Roccanera. There had been a party at dinner, so that though hewent early the company was already tolerably numerous. Osmond, asusual, was in the first room, near the fire, staring straight at thedoor, so that, not to be distinctly uncivil, Rosier had to go and speakto him.</p><p>"I'm glad that you can take a hint," Pansy's father said, slightly closing his keen, conscious eyes.</p><p>"I take no hints. But I took a message, as I supposed it to be."</p><p>"You took it? Where did you take it?"</p><p>It seemed to poor Rosier he was being insulted, and he waited amoment, asking himself how much a true lover ought to submit to."Madame Merle gave me, as I understood it, a message from you-- to theeffect that you declined to give me the opportunity I desire, theopportunity to explain my wishes to you." And he flattered himself hespoke rather sternly.</p><p>"I don't see what Madame Merle has to do with it. Why did you apply to Madame Merle?"</p><p>"I asked her for an opinion--for nothing more. I did so because she had seemed to me to know you very well."</p><p>"She doesn't know me so well as she thinks," said Osmond.</p><p>"I'm sorry for that, because she has given me some little ground for hope."</p><p>Osmond stared into the fire a moment. "I set a great price on my daughter."</p><p>"You can't set a higher one than I do. Don't I prove it by wishing to marry her?"</p><p>"I wish to marry her very well," Osmond went on with a dry impertinence which, in another mood, poor Rosier would have admired.</p><p>"Of course I pretend she'd marry well in marrying me. She couldn'tmarry a man who loves her more--or whom, I may venture to add, sheloves more."</p><p>"I'm not bound to accept your theories as to whom my daughter loves"--and Osmond looked up with a quick, cold smile.</p><p>"I'm not theorising. Your daughter has spoken."</p><p>"Not to me," Osmond continued, now bending forward a little and dropping his eyes to his boot-toes.</p><p>"I have her promise, sir!" cried Rosier with the sharpness of exasperation.</p><p>As their voices had been pitched very low before, such a noteattracted some attention from the company. Osmond waited till thislittle movement had subsided; then he said, all undisturbed: "I thinkshe has no recollection of having given it."</p><p>They had been standing with their faces to the fire, and after hehad uttered these last words the master of the house turned round againto the room. Before Rosier had time to reply he perceived that agentleman--a stranger--had just come in, unannounced, according to theRoman custom, and was about to present himself to his host. The lattersmiled blandly, but somewhat blankly; the visitor had a handsome faceand a large, fair beard, and was evidently an Englishman.</p><p>"You apparently don't recognise me," he said with a smile that expressed more than Osmond's.</p><p>"Ah yes, now I do. I expected so little to see you."</p><p>Rosier departed and went in direct pursuit of Pansy. He sought her,as usual, in the neighbouring room, but he again encountered Mrs.Osmond in his path. He gave his hostess no greeting--he was toorighteously indignant, but said to her crudely: "Your husband's awfullycold-blooded."</p><p>She gave the same mystical smile he had noticed before. "You can't expect every one to be as hot as yourself."</p><p>"I don't pretend to be cold, but I'm cool. What has he been doing to his daughter?"</p><p>"I've no idea."</p><p>"Don't you take any interest?" Rosier demanded with his sense that she too was irritating.</p><p>For a moment she answered nothing; then, "No!" she said abruptly andwith a quickened light in her eyes which directly contradicted the word.</p><p>"Pardon me if I don't believe that. Where's Miss Osmond?"</p><p>"In the corner, making tea. Please leave her there."</p><p>Rosier instantly discovered his friend, who had been hidden byintervening groups. He watched her, but her own attention was entirelygiven to her occupation. "What on earth has he done to her?" he askedagain imploringly. "He declares to me she has given me up."</p><p>"She has not given you up," Isabel said in a low tone and without looking at him.</p><p>"Ah, thank you for that! Now I'll leave her alone as long as you think proper!"</p><p>He had hardly spoken when he saw her change colour, and became awarethat Osmond was coming toward her accompanied by the gentleman who hadjust entered. He judged the latter, in spite of the advantage of goodlooks and evident social experience, a little embarrassed. "Isabel,"said her husband, "I bring you an old friend."</p><p>Mrs. Osmond's face, though it wore a smile, was, like her oldfriend's, not perfectly confident. "I'm very happy to see LordWarburton," she said. Rosier turned away and, now that his talk withher had been interrupted, felt absolved from the little pledge he hadjust taken. He had a quick impression that Mrs. Osmond wouldn't noticewhat he did.</p><p>Isabel in fact, to do him justice, for some time quite ceased toobserve him. She had been startled; she hardly knew if she felt apleasure or a pain. Lord Warburton, however, now that he was face toface with her, was plainly quite sure of his own sense of the matter;though his grey eyes had still their fine original property of keepingrecognition and attestation strictly sincere. He was "heavier" than ofyore and looked older; he stood there very solidly and sensibly.</p><p>"I suppose you didn't expect to see me," he said; "I've but justarrived. Literally, I only got here this evening. You see I've lost notime in coming to pay you my respects. I knew you were at home onThursdays."</p><p>"You see the fame of your Thursdays has spread to England," Osmond remarked to his wife.</p><p>"It's very kind of Lord Warburton to come so soon; we're greatly flattered," Isabel said.</p><p>"Ah well, it's better than stopping in one of those horrible inns," Osmond went on.</p><p>"The hotel seems very good; I think it's the same at which I saw youfour years since. You know it was here in Rome that we first met; it'sa long time ago. Do you remember where I bade you good-bye?" hislordship asked of his hostess. "It was in the Capitol, in the firstroom."</p><p>"I remember that myself," said Osmond. "I was there at the time."</p><p>"Yes, I remember you there. I was very sorry to leave Rome--so sorrythat, somehow or other, it became almost a dismal memory, and I'venever cared to come back till to-day. But I knew you were living here,"her old friend went on to Isabel, "and I assure you I've often thoughtof you. It must be a charming place to live in," he added with a look,round him, at her established home, in which she might have caught thedim ghost of his old ruefulness.</p><p>"We should have been glad to see you at any time," Osmond observed with propriety.</p><p>"Thank you very much. I haven't been out of England since then. Till a month ago I really supposed my travels over."</p><p>"I've heard of you from time to time," said Isabel, who had already,with her rare capacity for such inward feats, taken the measure of whatmeeting him again meant for her.</p><p>"I hope you've heard no harm. My life has been a remarkably complete blank."</p><p>"Like the good reigns in history," Osmond suggested. He appeared tothink his duties as a host now terminated--he had performed them soconscientiously. Nothing could have been more adequate, more nicelymeasured, than his courtesy to his wife's old friend. It waspunctilious, it was explicit, it was everything but natural--adeficiency which Lord Warburton, who, himself, had on the whole a gooddeal of nature, may be supposed to have perceived. "I'll leave you andMrs. Osmond together," he added. "You have reminiscences into which Idon't enter."</p><p>"I'm afraid you lose a good deal!" Lord Warburton called after him,as he moved away, in a tone which perhaps betrayed overmuch anappreciation of his generosity. Then the visitor turned on Isabel thedeeper, the deepest, consciousness of his look, which gradually becamemore serious. "I'm really very glad to see you."</p><p>"It's very pleasant. You're very kind."</p><p>"Do you know that you're changed--a little?"</p><p>She just hesitated. "Yes--a good deal."</p><p>"I don't mean for the worse, of course; and yet how can I say for the better?"</p><p>"I think I shall have no scruple in saying that to YOU," she bravely returned.</p><p>"Ah well, for me--it's a long time. It would be a pity thereshouldn't be something to show for it." They sat down and she asked himabout his sisters, with other enquiries of a somewhat perfunctory kind.He answered her questions as if they interested him, and in a fewmoments she saw--or believed she saw--that he would press with less ofhis whole weight than of yore. Time had breathed upon his heart and,without chilling it, given it a relieved sense of having taken the air.Isabel felt her usual esteem for Time rise at a bound. Her friend'smanner was certainly that of a contented man, one who would rather likepeople, or like her at least, to know him for such. "There's somethingI must tell you without more delay," he resumed. "I've brought RalphTouchett with me."</p><p>"Brought him with you?" Isabel's surprise was great.</p><p>"He's at the hotel; he was too tired to come out and has gone to bed."</p><p>"I'll go to see him," she immediately said.</p><p>"That's exactly what I hoped you'd do. I had an idea you hadn't seenmuch of him since your marriage, that in fact your relations were a--alittle more formal. That's why I hesitated--like an awkward Briton."</p><p>"I'm as fond of Ralph as ever," Isabel answered. "But why has hecome to Rome?" The declaration was very gentle, the question a littlesharp.</p><p>"Because he's very far gone, Mrs. Osmond."</p><p>"Rome then is no place for him. I heard from him that he haddetermined to give up his custom of wintering abroad and to remain inEngland, indoors, in what he called an artificial climate."</p><p>"Poor fellow, he doesn't succeed with the artificial! I went to seehim three weeks ago, at Gardencourt, and found him thoroughly ill. Hehas been getting worse every year, and now he has no strength left. Hesmokes no more cigarettes! He had got up an artificial climate indeed;the house was as hot as Calcutta. Nevertheless he had suddenly taken itinto his head to start for Sicily. I didn't believe in it--neither didthe doctors, nor any of his friends. His mother, as I suppose you know,is in America, so there was no one to prevent him. He stuck to his ideathat it would be the saving of him to spend the winter at Catania. Hesaid he could take servants and furniture, could make himselfcomfortable, but in point of fact he hasn't brought anything. I wantedhim at least to go by sea, to save fatigue; but he said he hated thesea and wished to stop at Rome. After that, though I thought it allrubbish, I made up my mind to come with him. I'm acting as--what do youcall it in America?--as a kind of moderator. Poor Ralph's very moderatenow. We left England a fortnight ago, and he has been very bad on theway. He can't keep warm, and the further south we come the more hefeels the cold. He has got rather a good man, but I'm afraid he'sbeyond human help. I wanted him to take with him some clever fellow--Imean some sharp young doctor; but he wouldn't hear of it. If you don'tmind my saying so, I think it was a most extraordinary time for Mrs.Touchett to decide on going to America."</p><p>Isabel had listened eagerly; her face was full of pain and wonder."My aunt does that at fixed periods and lets nothing turn her aside.When the date comes round she starts; I think she'd have started ifRalph had been dying."</p><p>"I sometimes think he IS dying," Lord Warburton said.</p><p>Isabel sprang up. "I'll go to him then now."</p><p>He checked her; he was a little disconcerted at the quick effect ofhis words. "I don't mean I thought so to-night. On the contrary,to-day, in the train, he seemed particularly well; the idea of ourreaching Rome--he's very fond of Rome, you know-- gave him strength. Anhour ago, when I bade him goodnight, he told me he was very tired, butvery happy. Go to him in the morning; that's all I mean. I didn't tellhim I was coming here; I didn't decide to till after we had separated.Then I remembered he had told me you had an evening, and that it wasthis very Thursday. It occurred to me to come in and tell you he'shere, and let you know you had perhaps better not wait for him to call.I think he said he hadn't written to you." There was no need ofIsabel's declaring that she would act upon Lord Warburton'sinformation; she looked, as she sat there, like a winged creature heldback. "Let alone that I wanted to see you for myself," her visitorgallantly added.</p><p>"I don't understand Ralph's plan; it seems to me very wild," shesaid. "I was glad to think of him between those thick walls atGardencourt."</p><p>"He was completely alone there; the thick walls were his only company."</p><p>"You went to see him; you've been extremely kind."</p><p>"Oh dear, I had nothing to do," said Lord Warburton.</p><p>"We hear, on the contrary, that you're doing great things. Every onespeaks of you as a great statesman, and I'm perpetually seeing yourname in the Times, which, by the way, doesn't appear to hold it inreverence. You're apparently as wild a radical as ever."</p><p>"I don't feel nearly so wild; you know the world has come round tome. Touchett and I have kept up a sort of parliamentary debate all theway from London. I tell him he's the last of the Tories, and he callsme the King of the Goths--says I have, down to the details of mypersonal appearance, every sign of the brute. So you see there's lifein him yet."</p><p>Isabel had many questions to ask about Ralph, but she abstained fromasking them all. She would see for herself on the morrow. She perceivedthat after a little Lord Warburton would tire of that subject--he had aconception of other possible topics. She was more and more able to sayto herself that he had recovered, and, what is more to the point, shewas able to say it without bitterness. He had been for her, of old,such an image of urgency, of insistence, of something to be resistedand reasoned with, that his reappearance at first menaced her with anew trouble. But she was now reassured; she could see he only wished tolive with her on good terms, that she was to understand he had forgivenher and was incapable of the bad taste of making pointed allusions.This was not a form of revenge, of course; she had no suspicion of hiswishing to punish her by an exhibition of disillusionment; she did himthe justice to believe it had simply occurred to him that she would nowtake a good-natured interest in knowing he was resigned. It was theresignation of a healthy, manly nature, in which sentimental woundscould never fester. British politics had cured him; she had known theywould. She gave an envious thought to the happier lot of men, who arealways free to plunge into the healing waters of action. Lord Warburtonof course spoke of the past, but he spoke of it without implications;he even went so far as to allude to their former meeting in Rome as avery jolly time. And he told her he had been immensely interested inhearing of her marriage and that it was a great pleasure for him tomake Mr. Osmond's acquaintance--since he could hardly be said to havemade it on the other occasion. He had not written to her at the time ofthat passage in her history, but he didn't apologise to her for this.The only thing he implied was that they were old friends, intimatefriends. It was very much as an intimate friend that he said to her,suddenly, after a short pause which he had occupied in smiling, as helooked about him, like a person amused, at a provincial entertainment,by some innocent game of guesses--</p><p>"Well now, I suppose you're very happy and all that sort of thing?"</p><p>Isabel answered with a quick laugh; the tone of his remark struckher almost as the accent of comedy. "Do you suppose if I were not I'dtell you?"</p><p>"Well, I don't know. I don't see why not."</p><p>"I do then. Fortunately, however, I'm very happy."</p><p>"You've got an awfully good house."</p><p>"Yes, it's very pleasant. But that's not my merit--it's my husband's."</p><p>"You mean he has arranged it?"</p><p>"Yes, it was nothing when we came."</p><p>"He must be very clever."</p><p>"He has a genius for upholstery," said Isabel.</p><p>"There's a great rage for that sort of thing now. But you must have a taste of your own."</p><p>"I enjoy things when they're done, but I've no ideas. I can never propose anything."</p><p>"Do you mean you accept what others propose?"</p><p>"Very willingly, for the most part."</p><p>"That's a good thing to know. I shall propose to you something."</p><p>"It will be very kind. I must say, however, that I've in a few smallways a certain initiative. I should like for instance to introduce youto some of these people."</p><p>"Oh, please don't; I prefer sitting here. Unless it be to that young lady in the blue dress. She has a charming face."</p><p>"The one talking to the rosy young man? That's my husband's daughter."</p><p>"Lucky man, your husband. What a dear little maid!"</p><p>"You must make her acquaintance."</p><p>"In a moment--with pleasure. I like looking at her from here." Heceased to look at her, however, very soon; his eyes constantly revertedto Mrs. Osmond. "Do you know I was wrong just now in saying you hadchanged?" he presently went on. "You seem to me, after all, very muchthe same."</p><p>"And yet I find it a great change to be married," said Isabel with mild gaiety.</p><p>"It affects most people more than it has affected you. You see I haven't gone in for that."</p><p>"It rather surprises me."</p><p>"You ought to understand it, Mrs. Osmond. But I do want to marry," he added more simply.</p><p>"It ought to be very easy," Isabel said, rising--after which shereflected, with a pang perhaps too visible, that she was hardly theperson to say this. It was perhaps because Lord Warburton divined thepang that he generously forbore to call her attention to her not havingcontributed then to the facility.</p><p>Edward Rosier had meanwhile seated himself on an ottoman besidePansy's tea-table. He pretended at first to talk to her about trifles,and she asked him who was the new gentleman conversing with herstepmother.</p><p>"He's an English lord," said Rosier. "I don't know more."</p><p>"I wonder if he'll have some tea. The English are so fond of tea."</p><p>"Never mind that; I've something particular to say to you."</p><p>"Don't speak so loud every one will hear," said Pansy.</p><p>"They won't hear if you continue to look that way: as if your only thought in life was the wish the kettle would boil."</p><p>"It has just been filled; the servants never know!"--and she sighed with the weight of her responsibility.</p><p>"Do you know what your father said to me just now? That you didn't mean what you said a week ago."</p><p>"I don't mean everything I say. How can a young girl do that? But I mean what I say to you."</p><p>"He told me you had forgotten me."</p><p>"Ah no, I don't forget," said Pansy, showing her pretty teeth in a fixed smile.</p><p>"Then everything's just the very same?"</p><p>"Ah no, not the very same. Papa has been terribly severe."</p><p>"What has he done to you?"</p><p>"He asked me what you had done to me, and I told him everything. Then he forbade me to marry you."</p><p>"You needn't mind that."</p><p>"Oh yes, I must indeed. I can't disobey papa."</p><p>"Not for one who loves you as I do, and whom you pretend to love?"</p><p>She raised the lid of the tea-pot, gazing into this vessel for amoment; then she dropped six words into its aromatic depths. "I loveyou just as much."</p><p>"What good will that do me?"</p><p>"Ah," said Pansy, raising her sweet, vague eyes, "I don't know that."</p><p>"You disappoint me," groaned poor Rosier.</p><p>She was silent a little; she handed a tea-cup to a servant. "Please don't talk any more."</p><p>"Is this to be all my satisfaction?"</p><p>"Papa said I was not to talk with you."</p><p>"Do you sacrifice me like that? Ah, it's too much!"</p><p>"I wish you'd wait a little," said the girl in a voice just distinct enough to betray a quaver.</p><p>"Of course I'll wait if you'll give me hope. But you take my life away."</p><p>"I'll not give you up--oh no!" Pansy went on.</p><p>"He'll try and make you marry some one else."</p><p>"I'll never do that."</p><p>"What then are we to wait for?"</p><p>She hesitated again. "I'll speak to Mrs. Osmond and she'll help us."It was in this manner that she for the most part designated herstepmother.</p><p>"She won't help us much. She's afraid."</p><p>"Afraid of what?"</p><p>"Of your father, I suppose."</p><p>Pansy shook her little head. "She's not afraid of any one. We must have patience."</p><p>"Ah, that's an awful word," Rosier groaned; he was deeplydisconcerted. Oblivious of the customs of good society, he dropped hishead into his hands and, supporting it with a melancholy grace, satstaring at the carpet. Presently he became aware of a good deal ofmovement about him and, as he looked up, saw Pansy making a curtsey--itwas still her little curtsey of the convent--to the English lord whomMrs. Osmond had introduced.</p></span><span id = 988 ><p>It will probably not surprise the reflective reader that RalphTouchett should have seen less of his cousin since her marriage than hehad done before that event--an event of which he took such a view ascould hardly prove a confirmation of intimacy. He had uttered histhought, as we know, and after this had held his peace, Isabel nothaving invited him to resume a discussion which marked an era in theirrelations. That discussion had made a difference--the difference hefeared rather than the one he hoped. It had not chilled the girl's zealin carrying out her engagement, but it had come dangerously near tospoiling a friendship. No reference was ever again made between them toRalph's opinion of Gilbert Osmond, and by surrounding this topic with asacred silence they managed to preserve a semblance of reciprocalfrankness. But there was a difference, as Ralph often said tohimself--there was a difference. She had not forgiven him, she neverwould forgive him: that was all he had gained. She thought she hadforgiven him; she believed she didn't care; and as she was both verygenerous and very proud these convictions represented a certainreality. But whether or no the event should justify him he wouldvirtually have done her a wrong, and the wrong was of the sort thatwomen remember best. As Osmond's wife she could never again be hisfriend. If in this character she should enjoy the felicity sheexpected, she would have nothing but contempt for the man who hadattempted, in advance, to undermine a blessing so dear; and if on theother hand his warning should be justified the vow she had taken thathe should never know it would lay upon her spirit such a burden as tomake her hate him. So dismal had been, during the year that followedhis cousin's marriage, Ralph's prevision of the future; and if hismeditations appear morbid we must remember he was not in the bloom ofhealth. He consoled himself as he might by behaving (as he deemed)beautifully, and was present at the ceremony by which Isabel was unitedto Mr. Osmond, and which was performed in Florence in the month ofJune. He learned from his mother that Isabel at first had thought ofcelebrating her nuptials in her native land, but that as simplicity waswhat she chiefly desired to secure she had finally decided, in spite ofOsmond's professed willingness to make a journey of any length, thatthis characteristic would be best embodied in their being married bythe nearest clergyman in the shortest time. The thing was donetherefore at the little American chapel, on a very hot day, in thepresence only of Mrs. Touchett and her son, of Pansy Osmond and theCountess Gemini. That severity in the proceedings of which I just spokewas in part the result of the absence of two persons who might havebeen looked for on the occasion and who would have lent it a certainrichness. Madame Merle had been invited, but Madame Merle, who wasunable to leave Rome, had written a gracious letter of excuses.Henrietta Stackpole had not been invited, as her departure fromAmerica, announced to Isabel by Mr. Goodwood, was in fact frustrated bythe duties of her profession; but she had sent a letter, less graciousthan Madame Merle's, intimating that, had she been able to cross theAtlantic, she would have been present not only as a witness but as acritic. Her return to Europe had taken place somewhat later, and shehad effected a meeting with Isabel in the autumn, in Paris, when shehad indulged--perhaps a trifle too freely--her critical genius. PoorOsmond, who was chiefly the subject of it, had protested so sharplythat Henrietta was obliged to declare to Isabel that she had taken astep which put a barrier between them. "It isn't in the least thatyou've married--it is that you have married HIM," she had deemed it herduty to remark; agreeing, it will be seen, much more with RalphTouchett than she suspected, though she had few of his hesitations andcompunctions. Henrietta's second visit to Europe, however, was notapparently to have been made in vain; for just at the moment whenOsmond had declared to Isabel that he really must object to thatnewspaper-woman, and Isabel had answered that it seemed to her he tookHenrietta too hard, the good Mr. Bantling had appeared upon the sceneand proposed that they should take a run down to Spain. Henrietta'sletters from Spain had proved the most acceptable she had yetpublished, and there had been one in especial, dated from the Alhambraand entitled 'Moors and Moonlight,' which generally passed for hermasterpiece. Isabel had been secretly disappointed at her husband's notseeing his way simply to take the poor girl for funny. She evenwondered if his sense of fun, or of the funny--which would be his senseof humour, wouldn't it?--were by chance defective. Of course sheherself looked at the matter as a person whose present happiness hadnothing to grudge to Henrietta's violated conscience. Osmond hadthought their alliance a kind of monstrosity; he couldn't imagine whatthey had in common. For him, Mr. Bantling's fellow tourist was simplythe most vulgar of women, and he had also pronounced her the mostabandoned. Against this latter clause of the verdict Isabel hadappealed with an ardour that had made him wonder afresh at the oddityof some of his wife's tastes. Isabel could explain it only by sayingthat she liked to know people who were as different as possible fromherself. "Why then don't you make the acquaintance of yourwasherwoman?" Osmond had enquired; to which Isabel had answered thatshe was afraid her washerwoman wouldn't care for her. Now Henriettacared so much.</p><p>Ralph had seen nothing of her for the greater part of the two yearsthat had followed her marriage; the winter that formed the beginning ofher residence in Rome he had spent again at San Remo, where he had beenjoined in the spring by his mother, who afterwards had gone with him toEngland, to see what they were doing at the bank--an operation shecouldn't induce him to perform. Ralph had taken a lease of his house atSan Remo, a small villa which he had occupied still another winter; butlate in the month of April of this second year he had come down toRome. It was the first time since her marriage that he had stood faceto face with Isabel; his desire to see her again was then of thekeenest. She had written to him from time to time, but her letters toldhim nothing he wanted to know. He had asked his mother what she wasmaking of her life, and his mother had simply answered that shesupposed she was making the best of it. Mrs. Touchett had not theimagination that communes with the unseen, and she now pretended to nointimacy with her niece, whom she rarely encountered. This young womanappeared to be living in a sufficiently honourable way, but Mrs.Touchett still remained of the opinion that her marriage had been ashabby affair. It had given her no pleasure to think of Isabel'sestablishment, which she was sure was a very lame business. From timeto time, in Florence, she rubbed against the Countess Gemini, doing herbest always to minimise the contact; and the Countess reminded her ofOsmond, who made her think of Isabel. The Countess was less talked ofin these days; but Mrs. Touchett augured no good of that: it onlyproved how she had been talked of before. There was a more directsuggestion of Isabel in the person of Madame Merle; but Madame Merle'srelations with Mrs. Touchett had undergone a perceptible change.Isabel's aunt had told her, without circumlocution, that she had playedtoo ingenious a part; and Madame Merle, who never quarrelled with anyone, who appeared to think no one worth it, and who had performed themiracle of living, more or less, for several years with Mrs. Touchettand showing no symptom of irritation--Madame Merle now took a very hightone and declared that this was an accusation from which she couldn'tstoop to defend herself. She added, however (without stooping), thather behaviour had been only too simple, that she had believed only whatshe saw, that she saw Isabel was not eager to marry and Osmond noteager to please (his repeated visits had been nothing; he was boringhimself to death on his hill-top and he came merely for amusement).Isabel had kept her sentiments to herself, and her journey to Greeceand Egypt had effectually thrown dust in her companion's eyes. MadameMerle accepted the event--she was unprepared to think of it as ascandal; but that she had played any part in it, double or single, wasan imputation against which she proudly protested. It was doubtless inconsequence of Mrs. Touchett's attitude, and of the injury it offeredto habits consecrated by many charming seasons, that Madame Merle had,after this, chosen to pass many months in England, where her credit wasquite unimpaired. Mrs. Touchett had done her a wrong; there are somethings that can't be forgiven. But Madame Merle suffered in silence;there was always something exquisite in her dignity.</p><p>Ralph, as I say, had wished to see for himself; but while engaged inthis pursuit he had yet felt afresh what a fool he had been to put thegirl on her guard. He had played the wrong card, and now he had lostthe game. He should see nothing, he should learn nothing; for him shewould always wear a mask. His true line would have been to professdelight in her union, so that later, when, as Ralph phrased it, thebottom should fall out of it, she might have the pleasure of saying tohim that he had been a goose. He would gladly have consented to passfor a goose in order to know Isabel's real situation. At present,however, she neither taunted him with his fallacies nor pretended thather own confidence was justified; if she wore a mask it completelycovered her face. There was something fixed and mechanical in theserenity painted on it; this was not an expression, Ralph said-- it wasa representation, it was even an advertisement. She had lost her child;that was a sorrow, but it was a sorrow she scarcely spoke of; there wasmore to say about it than she could say to Ralph. It belonged to thepast, moreover; it had occurred six months before and she had alreadylaid aside the tokens of mourning. She appeared to be leading the lifeof the world; Ralph heard her spoken of as having a "charmingposition." He observed that she produced the impression of beingpeculiarly enviable, that it was supposed, among many people, to be aprivilege even to know her. Her house was not open to every one, andshe had an evening in the week to which people were not invited as amatter of course. She lived with a certain magnificence, but you neededto be a member of her circle to perceive it; for there was nothing togape at, nothing to criticise, nothing even to admire, in the dailyproceedings of Mr. and Mrs. Osmond. Ralph, in all this, recognised thehand of the master; for he knew that Isabel had no faculty forproducing studied impressions. She struck him as having a great love ofmovement, of gaiety, of late hours, of long rides, of fatigue; aneagerness to be entertained, to be interested, even to be bored, tomake acquaintances, to see people who were talked about, to explore theneighbourhood of Rome, to enter into relation with certain of themustiest relics of its old society. In all this there was much lessdiscrimination than in that desire for comprehensiveness of developmenton which he had been used to exercise his wit. There was a kind ofviolence in some of her impulses, of crudity in some of herexperiments, which took him by surprise: it seemed to him that she evenspoke faster, moved faster, breathed faster, than before her marriage.Certainly she had fallen into exaggerations--she who used to care somuch for the pure truth; and whereas of old she had a great delight ingood-humoured argument, in intellectual play (she never looked socharming as when in the genial heat of discussion she received acrushing blow full in the face and brushed it away as a feather), sheappeared now to think there was nothing worth people's either differingabout or agreeing upon. Of old she had been curious, and now she wasindifferent, and yet in spite of her indifference her activity wasgreater than ever. Slender still, but lovelier than before, she hadgained no great maturity of aspect; yet there was an amplitude and abrilliancy in her personal arrangements that gave a touch of insolenceto her beauty. Poor human-hearted Isabel, what perversity had bittenher? Her light step drew a mass of drapery behind it; her intelligenthead sustained a majesty of ornament. The free, keen girl had becomequite another person; what he saw was the fine lady who was supposed torepresent something. What did Isabel represent? Ralph asked himself;and he could only answer by saying that she represented Gilbert Osmond."Good heavens, what a function!" he then woefully exclaimed. He waslost in wonder at the mystery of things.</p><p>He recognised Osmond, as I say; he recognised him at every turn. Hesaw how he kept all things within limits; how he adjusted, regulated,animated their manner of life. Osmond was in his element; at last hehad material to work with. He always had an eye to effect, and hiseffects were deeply calculated. They were produced by no vulgar means,but the motive was as vulgar as the art was great. To surround hisinterior with a sort of invidious sanctity, to tantalise society with asense of exclusion, to make people believe his house was different fromevery other, to impart to the face that he presented to the world acold originality--this was the ingenious effort of the personage towhom Isabel had attributed a superior morality. "He works with superiormaterial," Ralph said to himself; "it's rich abundance compared withhis former resources." Ralph was a clever man; but Ralph had never--tohis own sense--been so clever as when he observed, in petto, that underthe guise of caring only for intrinsic values Osmond lived exclusivelyfor the world. Far from being its master as he pretended to be, he wasits very humble servant, and the degree of its attention was his onlymeasure of success. He lived with his eye on it from morning tillnight, and the world was so stupid it never suspected the trick.Everything he did was pose--pose so subtly considered that if one werenot on the lookout one mistook it for impulse. Ralph had never met aman who lived so much in the land of consideration. His tastes, hisstudies, his accomplishments, his collections, were all for a purpose.His life on his hill-top at Florence had been the conscious attitude ofyears. His solitude, his ennui, his love for his daughter, his goodmanners, his bad manners, were so many features of a mental imageconstantly present to him as a model of impertinence and mystification.His ambition was not to please the world, but to please himself byexciting the world's curiosity and then declining to satisfy it. It hadmade him feel great, ever, to play the world a trick. The thing he haddone in his life most directly to please himself was his marrying MissArcher; though in this case indeed the gullible world was in a mannerembodied in poor Isabel, who had been mystified to the top of her bent.Ralph of course found a fitness in being consistent; he had embraced acreed, and as he had suffered for it he could not in honour forsake it.I give this little sketch of its articles for what they may at the timehave been worth. It was certain that he was very skilful in fitting thefacts to his theory--even the fact that during the month he spent inRome at this period the husband of the woman he loved appeared toregard him not in the least as an enemy.</p><p>For Gilbert Osmond Ralph had not now that importance. It was notthat he had the importance of a friend; it was rather that he had noneat all. He was Isabel's cousin and he was rather unpleasantly ill--itwas on this basis that Osmond treated with him. He made the properenquiries, asked about his health, about Mrs. Touchett, about hisopinion of winter climates, whether he were comfortable at his hotel.He addressed him, on the few occasions of their meeting, not a wordthat was not necessary; but his manner had always the urbanity properto conscious success in the presence of conscious failure. For allthis, Ralph had had, toward the end, a sharp inward vision of Osmond'smaking it of small ease to his wife that she should continue to receiveMr. Touchett. He was not jealous--he had not that excuse; no one couldbe jealous of Ralph. But he made Isabel pay for her old-time kindness,of which so much was still left; and as Ralph had no idea of her payingtoo much, so when his suspicion had become sharp, he had taken himselfoff. In doing so he had deprived Isabel of a very interestingoccupation: she had been constantly wondering what fine principle waskeeping him alive. She had decided that it was his love ofconversation; his conversation had been better than ever. He had givenup walking; be was no longer a humorous stroller. He sat all day in achair --almost any chair would serve, and was so dependent on what youwould do for him that, had not his talk been highly contemplative, youmight have thought he was blind. The reader already knows more abouthim than Isabel was ever to know, and the reader may therefore be giventhe key to the mystery. What kept Ralph alive was simply the fact thathe had not yet seen enough of the person in the world in whom he wasmost interested: he was not yet satisfied. There was more to come; hecouldn't make up his mind to lose that. He wanted to see what she wouldmake of her husband--or what her husband would make of her. This wasonly the first act of the drama, and he was determined to sit out theperformance. His determination had held good; it had kept him goingsome eighteen months more, till the time of his return to Rome withLord Warburton. It had given him indeed such an air of intending tolive indefinitely that Mrs. Touchett, though more accessible toconfusions of thought in the matter of this strange,unremunerative--and unremunerated--son of hers than she had ever beenbefore, had, as we have learned, not scrupled to embark for a distantland. If Ralph had been kept alive by suspense it was with a good dealof the same emotion--the excitement of wondering in what state sheshould find him--that Isabel mounted to his apartment the day afterLord Warburton had notified her of his arrival in Rome.</p><p>She spent an hour with him; it was the first of several visits.Gilbert Osmond called on him punctually, and on their sending theircarriage for him Ralph came more than once to Palazzo Roccanera. Afortnight elapsed, at the end of which Ralph announced to LordWarburton that he thought after all he wouldn't go to Sicily. The twomen had been dining together after a day spent by the latter in rangingabout the Campagna. They had left the table, and Warburton, before thechimney, was lighting a cigar, which he instantly removed from his lips.</p><p>"Won't go to Sicily? Where then will you go?"</p><p>"Well, I guess I won't go anywhere," said Ralph, from the sofa, all shamelessly.</p><p>"Do you mean you'll return to England?"</p><p>"Oh dear no; I'll stay in Rome."</p><p>"Rome won't do for you. Rome's not warm enough."</p><p>"It will have to do. I'll make it do. See how well I've been."</p><p>Lord Warburton looked at him a while, puffing a cigar and as iftrying to see it. "You've been better than you were on the journey,certainly. I wonder how you lived through that. But I don't understandyour condition. I recommend you to try Sicily."</p><p>"I can't try," said poor Ralph. "I've done trying. I can't movefurther. I can't face that journey. Fancy me between Scylla andCharybdis! I don't want to die on the Sicilian plains--to be snatchedaway, like Proserpine in the same locality, to the Plutonian shades."</p><p>"What the deuce then did you come for?" his lordship enquired.</p><p>"Because the idea took me. I see it won't do. It really doesn'tmatter where I am now. I've exhausted all remedies, I've swallowed allclimates. As I'm here I'll stay. I haven't a single cousin inSicily--much less a married one."</p><p>"Your cousin's certainly an inducement. But what does the doctor say?"</p><p>"I haven't asked him, and I don't care a fig. If I die here Mrs. Osmond will bury me. But I shall not die here."</p><p>"I hope not." Lord Warburton continued to smoke reflectively. "Well,I must say," he resumed, "for myself I'm very glad you don't insist onSicily. I had a horror of that journey."</p><p>"Ah, but for you it needn't have mattered. I had no idea of dragging you in my train."</p><p>"I certainly didn't mean to let you go alone."</p><p>"My dear Warburton, I never expected you to come further than this," Ralph cried.</p><p>"I should have gone with you and seen you settled," said Lord Warburton.</p><p>"You're a very good Christian. You're a very kind man."</p><p>"Then I should have come back here."</p><p>"And then you'd have gone to England."</p><p>"No, no; I should have stayed."</p><p>"Well," said Ralph, "if that's what we are both up to, I don't see where Sicily comes in!"</p><p>His companion was silent; he sat staring at the fire. At last,looking up, "I say, tell me this," he broke out; "did you really meanto go to Sicily when we started?"</p><p>"Ah, vous m'en demandez trop! Let me put a question first. Did you come with me quite--platonically?"</p><p>"I don't know what you mean by that. I wanted to come abroad."</p><p>"I suspect we've each been playing our little game."</p><p>"Speak for yourself. I made no secret whatever of my desiring to be here a while."</p><p>"Yes, I remember you said you wished to see the Minister of Foreign Affairs."</p><p>"I've seen him three times. He's very amusing."</p><p>"I think you've forgotten what you came for," said Ralph.</p><p>"Perhaps I have," his companion answered rather gravely.</p><p>These two were gentlemen of a race which is not distinguished by theabsence of reserve, and they had travelled together from London to Romewithout an allusion to matters that were uppermost in the mind of each.There was an old subject they had once discussed, but it had lost itsrecognised place in their attention, and even after their arrival inRome, where many things led back to it, they had kept the samehalf-diffident, half-confident silence.</p><p>"I recommend you to get the doctor's consent, all the same," Lord Warburton went on, abruptly, after an interval.</p><p>"The doctor's consent will spoil it. I never have it when I can help it."</p><p>"What then does Mrs. Osmond think?" Ralph's friend demanded. I'venot told her. She'll probably say that Rome's too cold and even offerto go with me to Catania. She's capable of that."</p><p>"In your place I should like it."</p><p>"Her husband won't like it."</p><p>"Ah well, I can fancy that; though it seems to me you're not bound to mind his likings. They're his affair."</p><p>"I don't want to make any more trouble between them," said Ralph.</p><p>"Is there so much already?"</p><p>"There's complete preparation for it. Her going off with me would make the explosion. Osmond isn't fond of his wife's cousin."</p><p>"Then of course he'd make a row. But won't he make a row if you stop here?"</p><p>"That's what I want to see. He made one the last time I was in Rome,and then I thought it my duty to disappear. Now I think it's my duty tostop and defend her."</p><p>"My dear Touchett, your defensive powers--!" Lord Warburton beganwith a smile. But he saw something in his companion's face that checkedhim. "Your duty, in these premises, seems to me rather a nicequestion," he observed instead.</p><p>Ralph for a short time answered nothing. "It's true that mydefensive powers are small," he returned at last; "but as my aggressiveones are still smaller Osmond may after all not think me worth hisgunpowder. At any rate," he added, "there are things I'm curious tosee."</p><p>"You're sacrificing your health to your curiosity then?"</p><p>"I'm not much interested in my health, and I'm deeply interested in Mrs. Osmond."</p><p>"So am I. But not as I once was," Lord Warburton added quickly. Thiswas one of the allusions he had not hitherto found occasion to make.</p><p>"Does she strike you as very happy?" Ralph enquired, emboldened by this confidence.</p><p>"Well, I don't know; I've hardly thought. She told me the other night she was happy."</p><p>"Ah, she told YOU, of course," Ralph exclaimed, smiling.</p><p>"I don't know that. It seems to me I was rather the sort of person she might have complained to."</p><p>"Complained? She'll never complain. She has done it--what she HASdone--and she knows it. She'll complain to you least of all. She's verycareful."</p><p>"She needn't be. I don't mean to make love to her again."</p><p>"I'm delighted to hear it. There can be no doubt at least of YOUR duty."</p><p>"Ah no," said Lord Warburton gravely; "none!"</p><p>"Permit me to ask," Ralph went on, "whether it's to bring out thefact that you don't mean to make love to her that you're so very civilto the little girl?"</p><p>Lord Warburton gave a slight start; he got up and stood before thefire, looking at it hard. "Does that strike you as very ridiculous?"</p><p>"Ridiculous? Not in the least, if you really like her."</p><p>"I think her a delightful little person. I don't know when a girl of that age has pleased me more."</p><p>"She's a charming creature. Ah, she at least is genuine."</p><p>"Of course there's the difference in our ages--more than twenty years."</p><p>"My dear Warburton," said Ralph, "are you serious?"</p><p>"Perfectly serious--as far as I've got."</p><p>"I'm very glad. And, heaven help us," cried Ralph, "how cheered-up old Osmond will be!"</p><p>His companion frowned. "I say, don't spoil it. I shouldn't propose for his daughter to please HIM."</p><p>"He'll have the perversity to be pleased all the same."</p><p>"He's not so fond of me as that," said his lordship.</p><p>"As that? My dear Warburton, the drawback of your position is thatpeople needn't be fond of you at all to wish to be connected with you.Now, with me in such a case, I should have the happy confidence thatthey loved me."</p><p>Lord Warburton seemed scarcely in the mood for doing justice togeneral axioms--he was thinking of a special case. "Do you judge she'llbe pleased?"</p><p>"The girl herself? Delighted, surely."</p><p>"No, no; I mean Mrs. Osmond."</p><p>Ralph looked at him a moment. "My dear fellow, what has she to do with it?"</p><p>"Whatever she chooses. She's very fond of Pansy."</p><p>"Very true--very true." And Ralph slowly got up. "It's aninteresting question--how far her fondness for Pansy will carry her."He stood there a moment with his hands in his pockets and rather aclouded brow. "I hope, you know, that you're very--very sure. Thedeuce!" he broke off. "I don't know how to say it."</p><p>"Yes, you do; you know how to say everything."</p><p>"Well, it's awkward. I hope you're sure that among Miss Osmond'smerits her being--a--so near her stepmother isn't a leading one?"</p><p>"Good heavens, Touchett!" cried Lord Warburton angrily, "for what do you take me?"</p></span><span id = 989 ><p>Isabel had not seen much of Madame Merle since her marriage, thislady having indulged in frequent absences from Rome. At one time shehad spent six months in England; at another she had passed a portion ofa winter in Paris. She had made numerous visits to distant friends andgave countenance to the idea that for the future she should be a lessinveterate Roman than in the past. As she had been inveterate in thepast only in the sense of constantly having an apartment in one of thesunniest niches of the Pincian--an apartment which often stoodempty--this suggested a prospect of almost constant absence; a dangerwhich Isabel at one period had been much inclined to deplore.Familiarity had modified in some degree her first impression of MadameMerle, but it had not essentially altered it; there was still muchwonder of admiration in it. That personage was armed at all points; itwas a pleasure to see a character so completely equipped for the socialbattle. She carried her flag discreetly, but her weapons were polishedsteel, and she used them with a skill which struck Isabel as more andmore that of a veteran. She was never weary, never overcome withdisgust; she never appeared to need rest or consolation. She had herown ideas; she had of old exposed a great many of them to Isabel, whoknew also that under an appearance of extreme self-control herhighly-cultivated friend concealed a rich sensibility. But her will wasmistress of her life; there was something gallant in the way she keptgoing. It was as if she had learned the secret of it--as if the art oflife were some clever trick she had guessed. Isabel, as she herselfgrew older, became acquainted with revulsions, with disgusts; therewere days when the world looked black and she asked herself with somesharpness what it was that she was pretending to live for. Her oldhabit had been to live by enthusiasm, to fall in love withsuddenly-perceived possibilities, with the idea of some new adventure.As a younger person she had been used to proceed from one littleexaltation to the other: there were scarcely any dull places between.But Madame Merle had suppressed enthusiasm; she fell in love now-a-dayswith nothing; she lived entirely by reason and by wisdom. There werehours when Isabel would have given anything for lessons in this art; ifher brilliant friend had been near she would have made an appeal toher. She had become aware more than before of the advantage of beinglike that --of having made one's self a firm surface, a sort ofcorselet of silver.</p><p>But, as I say, it was not till the winter during which we latelyrenewed acquaintance with our heroine that the personage in questionmade again a continuous stay in Rome. Isabel now saw more of her thanshe had done since her marriage; but by this time Isabel's needs andinclinations had considerably changed. It was not at present to MadameMerle that she would have applied for instruction; she had lost thedesire to know this lady's clever trick. If she had troubles she mustkeep them to herself, and if life was difficult it would not make iteasier to confess herself beaten. Madame Merle was doubtless of greatuse to herself and an ornament to any circle; but was she--would she be--of use to others in periods of refined embarrassment? The best way toprofit by her friend--this indeed Isabel had always thought--was toimitate her, to be as firm and bright as she. She recognised noembarrassments, and Isabel, considering this fact, determined for thefiftieth time to brush aside her own. It seemed to her too, on therenewal of an intercourse which had virtually been interrupted, thather old ally was different, was almost detached--pushing to the extremea certain rather artificial fear of being indiscreet. Ralph Touchett,we know, had been of the opinion that she was prone to exaggeration, toforcing the note--was apt, in the vulgar phrase, to overdo it. Isabelhad never admitted this charge--had never indeed quite understood it;Madame Merle's conduct, to her perception, always bore the stamp ofgood taste, was always "quiet." But in this matter of not wishing tointrude upon the inner life of the Osmond family it at last occurred toour young woman that she overdid a little. That of course was not thebest taste; that was rather violent. She remembered too much thatIsabel was married; that she had now other interests; that though she,Madame Merle, had known Gilbert Osmond and his little Pansy very well,better almost than any one, she was not after all of the inner circle.She was on her guard; she never spoke of their affairs till she wasasked, even pressed--as when her opinion was wanted; she had a dread ofseeming to meddle. Madame Merle was as candid as we know, and one dayshe candidly expressed this dread to Isabel.</p><p>"I MUST be on my guard," she said; "I might so easily, withoutsuspecting it, offend you. You would be right to be offended, even ifmy intention should have been of the purest. I must not forget that Iknew your husband long before you did; I must not let that betray me.If you were a silly woman you might be jealous. You're not a sillywoman; I know that perfectly. But neither am I; therefore I'mdetermined not to get into trouble. A little harm's very soon done; amistake's made before one knows it. Of course if I had wished to makelove to your husband I had ten years to do it in, and nothing toprevent; so it isn't likely I shall begin to-day, when I'm so much lessattractive than I was. But if I were to annoy you by seeming to take aplace that doesn't belong to me, you wouldn't make that reflection;you'd simply say I was forgetting certain differences. I'm determinednot to forget them. Certainly a good friend isn't always thinking ofthat; one doesn't suspect one's friends of injustice. I don't suspectyou, my dear, in the least; but I suspect human nature. Don't think Imake myself uncomfortable; I'm not always watching myself. I think Isufficiently prove it in talking to you as I do now. All I wish to sayis, however, that if you were to be jealous--that's the form it wouldtake--I should be sure to think it was a little my fault. It certainlywouldn't be your husband's."</p><p>Isabel had had three years to think over Mrs. Touchett's theory thatMadame Merle had made Gilbert Osmond's marriage. We know how she had atfirst received it. Madame Merle might have made Gilbert Osmond'smarriage, but she certainly had not made Isabel Archer's. That was thework of--Isabel scarcely knew what: of nature, providence, fortune, ofthe eternal mystery of things. It was true her aunt's complaint hadbeen not so much of Madame Merle's activity as of her duplicity: shehad brought about the strange event and then she had denied her guilt.Such guilt would not have been great, to Isabel's mind; she couldn'tmake a crime of Madame Merle's having been the producing cause of themost important friendship she had ever formed. This had occurred to herjust before her marriage, after her little discussion with her aunt andat a time when she was still capable of that large inward reference,the tone almost of the philosophic historian, to her scant youngannals. If Madame Merle had desired her change of state she could onlysay it had been a very happy thought. With her, moreover, she had beenperfectly straightforward; she had never concealed her high opinion ofGilbert Osmond. After their union Isabel discovered that her husbandtook a less convenient view of the matter; he seldom consented tofinger, in talk, this roundest and smoothest bead of their socialrosary. "Don't you like Madame Merle?" Isabel had once said to him."She thinks a great deal of you."</p><p>"I'll tell you once for all," Osmond had answered. "I liked her oncebetter than I do to-day. I'm tired of her, and I'm rather ashamed ofit. She's so almost unnaturally good! I'm glad she's not in Italy; itmakes for relaxation--for a sort of moral detente. Don't talk of hertoo much; it seems to bring her back. She'll come back in plenty oftime."</p><p>Madame Merle, in fact, had come back before it was too late--toolate, I mean, to recover whatever advantage she might have lost. Butmeantime, if, as I have said, she was sensibly different, Isabel'sfeelings were also not quite the same. Her consciousness of thesituation was as acute as of old, but it was much less satisfying. Adissatisfied mind, whatever else it may miss, is rarely in want ofreasons; they bloom as thick as buttercups in June. The fact of MadameMerle's having had a hand in Gilbert Osmond's marriage ceased to be oneof her titles to consideration; it might have been written, after all,that there was not so much to thank her for. As time went on there wasless and less, and Isabel once said to herself that perhaps without herthese things would not have been. That reflection indeed was instantlystifled; she knew an immediate horror at having made it. "Whateverhappens to me let me not be unjust," she said; "let me bear my burdensmyself and not shift them upon others!" This disposition was tested,eventually, by that ingenious apology for her present conduct whichMadame Merle saw fit to make and of which I have given a sketch; forthere was something irritating-- there was almost an air of mockery--inher neat discriminations and clear convictions. In Isabel's mind to-daythere was nothing clear; there was a confusion of regrets, acomplication of fears. She felt helpless as she turned away from herfriend, who had just made the statements I have quoted: Madame Merleknew so little what she was thinking of! She was herself moreover sounable to explain. Jealous of her--jealous of her with Gilbert? Theidea just then suggested no near reality. She almost wished jealousyhad been possible; it would have made in a manner for refreshment.Wasn't it in a manner one of the symptoms of happiness? Madame Merle,however, was wise, so wise that she might have been pretending to knowIsabel better than Isabel knew herself. This young woman had alwaysbeen fertile in resolutions --any of them of an elevated character; butat no period had they flourished (in the privacy of her heart) morerichly than to-day. It is true that they all had a family likeness;they might have been summed up in the determination that if she was tobe unhappy it should not be by a fault of her own. Her poor wingedspirit had always had a great desire to do its best, and it had not asyet been seriously discouraged. It wished, therefore, to hold fast tojustice--not to pay itself by petty revenges. To associate Madame Merlewith its disappointment would be a petty revenge--especially as thepleasure to be derived from that would be perfectly insincere. It mightfeed her sense of bitterness, but it would not loosen her bonds. It wasimpossible to pretend that she had not acted with her eyes open; ifever a girl was a free agent she had been. A girl in love was doubtlessnot a free agent; but the sole source of her mistake had been withinherself. There had been no plot, no snare; she had looked andconsidered and chosen. When a woman had made such a mistake, there wasonly one way to repair it--just immensely (oh, with the highestgrandeur!) to accept it. One folly was enough, especially when it wasto last for ever; a second one would not much set it off. In this vowof reticence there was a certain nobleness which kept Isabel going; butMadame Merle had been right, for all that, in taking her precautions.</p><p>One day about a month after Ralph Touchett's arrival in Rome Isabelcame back from a walk with Pansy. It was not only a part of her generaldetermination to be just that she was at present very thankful forPansy--it was also a part of her tenderness for things that were pureand weak. Pansy was dear to her, and there was nothing else in her lifethat had the rightness of the young creature's attachment or thesweetness of her own clearness about it. It was like a softpresence--like a small hand in her own; on Pansy's part it was morethan an affection--it was a kind of ardent coercive faith. On her ownside her sense of the girl's dependence was more than a pleasure; itoperated as a definite reason when motives threatened to fail her. Shehad said to herself that we must take our duty where we find it, andthat we must look for it as much as possible. Pansy's sympathy was adirect admonition; it seemed to say that here was an opportunity, noteminent perhaps, but unmistakeable. Yet an opportunity for what Isabelcould hardly have said; in general, to be more for the child than thechild was able to be for herself. Isabel could have smiled, in thesedays, to remember that her little companion had once been ambiguous,for she now perceived that Pansy's ambiguities were simply her owngrossness of vision. She had been unable to believe any one could careso much--so extraordinarily much--to please. But since then she hadseen this delicate faculty in operation, and now she knew what to thinkof it. It was the whole creature--it was a sort of genius. Pansy had nopride to interfere with it, and though she was constantly extending herconquests she took no credit for them. The two were constantlytogether; Mrs. Osmond was rarely seen without her stepdaughter. Isabelliked her company; it had the effect of one's carrying a nosegaycomposed all of the same flower. And then not to neglect Pansy, notunder any provocation to neglect her--this she had made an article ofreligion. The young girl had every appearance of being happier inIsabel's society than in that of any one save her father,--whom sheadmired with an intensity justified by the fact that, as paternity wasan exquisite pleasure to Gilbert Osmond, he had always been luxuriouslymild. Isabel knew how Pansy liked to be with her and how she studiedthe means of pleasing her. She had decided that the best way ofpleasing her was negative, and consisted in not giving her trouble--aconviction which certainly could have had no reference to troublealready existing. She was therefore ingeniously passive and almostimaginatively docile; she was careful even to moderate the eagernesswith which she assented to Isabel's propositions and which might haveimplied that she could have thought otherwise. She never interrupted,never asked social questions, and though she delighted in approbation,to the point of turning pale when it came to her, never held out herhand for it. She only looked toward it wistfully--an attitude which, asshe grew older, made her eyes the prettiest in the world. When duringthe second winter at Palazzo Roccanera she began to go to parties, todances, she always, at a reasonable hour, lest Mrs. Osmond should betired, was the first to propose departure. Isabel appreciated thesacrifice of the late dances, for she knew her little companion had apassionate pleasure in this exercise, taking her steps to the musiclike a conscientious fairy. Society, moreover, had no drawbacks forher; she liked even the tiresome parts--the heat of ball-rooms, thedulness of dinners, the crush at the door, the awkward waiting for thecarriage. During the day, in this vehicle, beside her stepmother, shesat in a small fixed, appreciative posture, bending forward and faintlysmiling, as if she had been taken to drive for the first time.</p><p>On the day I speak of they had been driven out of one of the gatesof the city and at the end of half an hour had left the carriage toawait them by the roadside while they walked away over the short grassof the Campagna, which even in the winter months is sprinkled withdelicate flowers. This was almost a daily habit with Isabel, who wasfond of a walk and had a swift length of step, though not so swift aone as on her first coming to Europe. It was not the form of exercisethat Pansy loved best, but she liked it, because she liked everything;and she moved with a shorter undulation beside her father's wife, whoafterwards, on their return to Rome, paid a tribute to her preferencesby making the circuit of the Pincian or the Villa Borghese. She hadgathered a handful of flowers in a sunny hollow, far from the walls ofRome, and on reaching Palazzo Roccanera she went straight to her room,to put them into water. Isabel passed into the drawing-room, the oneshe herself usually occupied, the second in order from the largeante-chamber which was entered from the staircase and in which evenGilbert Osmond's rich devices had not been able to correct a look ofrather grand nudity. Just beyond the threshold of the drawing-room shestopped short, the reason for her doing so being that she had receivedan impression. The impression had, in strictness, nothingunprecedented; but she felt it as something new, and the soundlessnessof her step gave her time to take in the scene before she interruptedit. Madame Merle was there in her bonnet, and Gilbert Osmond wastalking to her; for a minute they were unaware she had come in. Isabelhad often seen that before, certainly; but what she had not seen, or atleast had not noticed, was that their colloquy had for the momentconverted itself into a sort of familiar silence, from which sheinstantly perceived that her entrance would startle them. Madame Merlewas standing on the rug, a little way from the fire; Osmond was in adeep chair, leaning back and looking at her. Her head was erect, asusual, but her eyes were bent on his. What struck Isabel first was thathe was sitting while Madame Merle stood; there was an anomaly in thisthat arrested her. Then she perceived that they had arrived at adesultory pause in their exchange of ideas and were musing, face toface, with the freedom of old friends who sometimes exchange ideaswithout uttering them. There was nothing to shock in this; they wereold friends in fact. But the thing made an image, lasting only amoment, like a sudden flicker of light. Their relative positions, theirabsorbed mutual gaze, struck her as something detected. But it was allover by the time she had fairly seen it. Madame Merle had seen her andhad welcomed her without moving; her husband, on the other hand, hadinstantly jumped up. He presently murmured something about wanting awalk and, after having asked their visitor to excuse him, left the room.</p><p>"I came to see you, thinking you would have come in; and as you hadn't I waited for you," Madame Merle said.</p><p>"Didn't he ask you to sit down?" Isabel asked with a smile.</p><p>Madame Merle looked about her. "Ah, it's very true; I was going away."</p><p>"You must stay now."</p><p>"Certainly. I came for a reason; I've something on my mind."</p><p>"I've told you that before," Isabel said--"that it takes something extraordinary to bring you to this house."</p><p>"And you know what I've told YOU; that whether I come or whether Istay away, I've always the same motive--the affection I bear you."</p><p>"Yes, you've told me that."</p><p>"You look just now as if you didn't believe it," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"Ah," Isabel answered, "the profundity of your motives, that's the last thing I doubt!"</p><p>"You doubt sooner of the sincerity of my words."</p><p>Isabel shook her head gravely. "I know you've always been kind to me."</p><p>"As often as you would let me. You don't always take it; then onehas to let you alone. It's not to do you a kindness, however, that I'vecome to-day; it's quite another affair. I've come to get rid of atrouble of my own--to make it over to you. I've been talking to yourhusband about it."</p><p>"I'm surprised at that; he doesn't like troubles."</p><p>"Especially other people's; I know very well. But neither do you, Isuppose. At any rate, whether you do or not, you must help me. It'sabout poor Mr. Rosier."</p><p>"Ah," said Isabel reflectively, "it's his trouble then, not yours."</p><p>"He has succeeded in saddling me with it. He comes to see me ten times a week, to talk about Pansy."</p><p>"Yes, he wants to marry her. I know all about it."</p><p>Madame Merle hesitated. "I gathered from your husband that perhaps you didn't."</p><p>"How should he know what I know? He has never spoken to me of the matter."</p><p>"It's probably because he doesn't know how to speak of it."</p><p>"It's nevertheless the sort of question in which he's rarely at fault."</p><p>"Yes, because as a general thing he knows perfectly well what to think. To-day he doesn't."</p><p>"Haven't you been telling him?" Isabel asked.</p><p>Madame Merle gave a bright, voluntary smile. "Do you know you're a little dry?"</p><p>"Yes; I can't help it. Mr. Rosier has also talked to me."</p><p>"In that there's some reason. You're so near the child."</p><p>"Ah," said Isabel, "for all the comfort I've given him! If you think me dry, I wonder what HE thinks."</p><p>"I believe he thinks you can do more than you have done."</p><p>"I can do nothing."</p><p>"You can do more at least than I. I don't know what mysteriousconnection he may have discovered between me and Pansy; but he came tome from the first, as if I held his fortune in my hand. Now he keepscoming back, to spur me up, to know what hope there is, to pour out hisfeelings."</p><p>"He's very much in love," said Isabel.</p><p>"Very much--for him."</p><p>"Very much for Pansy, you might say as well."</p><p>Madame Merle dropped her eyes a moment. "Don't you think she's attractive?"</p><p>"The dearest little person possible--but very limited."</p><p>"She ought to be all the easier for Mr. Rosier to love. Mr. Rosier's not unlimited."</p><p>"No," said Isabel, "he has about the extent of one'spocket-handkerchief--the small ones with lace borders." Her humour hadlately turned a good deal to sarcasm, but in a moment she was ashamedof exercising it on so innocent an object as Pansy's suitor. "He's verykind, very honest," she presently added; "and he's not such a fool ashe seems."</p><p>"He assures me that she delights in him," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"I don't know; I've not asked her."</p><p>"You've never sounded her a little?"</p><p>"It's not my place; it's her father's."</p><p>"Ah, you're too literal!" said Madame Merle.</p><p>"I must judge for myself."</p><p>Madame Merle gave her smile again. "It isn't easy to help you."</p><p>"To help me?" said Isabel very seriously. "What do you mean?"</p><p>"It's easy to displease you. Don't you see how wise I am to becareful? I notify you, at any rate, as I notified Osmond, that I washmy hands of the love-affairs of Miss Pansy and Mr. Edward Rosier. Jen'y peux rien, moi! I can't talk to Pansy about him. Especially," addedMadame Merle, "as I don't think him a paragon of husbands."</p><p>Isabel reflected a little; after which, with a smile, "You don'twash your hands then!" she said. After which again she added in anothertone: "You can't--you're too much interested."</p><p>Madame Merle slowly rose; she had given Isabel a look as rapid asthe intimation that had gleamed before our heroine a few momentsbefore. Only this time the latter saw nothing. "Ask him the next time,and you'll see."</p><p>"I can't ask him; he has ceased to come to the house. Gilbert has let him know that he's not welcome."</p><p>"Ah yes," said Madame Merle, "I forgot that--though it's the burdenof his lamentation. He says Osmond has insulted him. All the same," shewent on, "Osmond doesn't dislike him so much as he thinks." She had gotup as if to close the conversation, but she lingered, looking abouther, and had evidently more to say. Isabel perceived this and even sawthe point she had in view; but Isabel also had her own reasons for notopening the way.</p><p>"That must have pleased him, if you've told him," she answered, smiling.</p><p>"Certainly I've told him; as far as that goes I've encouraged him.I've preached patience, have said that his case isn't desperate ifhe'll only hold his tongue and be quiet. Unfortunately he has taken itinto his head to be jealous."</p><p>"Jealous?"</p><p>"Jealous of Lord Warburton, who, he says, is always here."</p><p>Isabel, who was tired, had remained sitting; but at this she alsorose. "Ah!" she exclaimed simply, moving slowly to the fireplace.Madame Merle observed her as she passed and while she stood a momentbefore the mantel-glass and pushed into its place a wandering tress ofhair.</p><p>"Poor Mr. Rosier keeps saying there's nothing impossible in LordWarburton's falling in love with Pansy," Madame Merle went on. Isabelwas silent a little; she turned away from the glass. "It'strue--there's nothing impossible," she returned at last, gravely andmore gently.</p><p>"So I've had to admit to Mr. Rosier. So, too, your husband thinks."</p><p>"That I don't know."</p><p>"Ask him and you'll see."</p><p>"I shall not ask him," said Isabel.</p><p>"Pardon me; I forgot you had pointed that out. Of course," MadameMerle added, "you've had infinitely more observation of LordWarburton's behaviour than I."</p><p>"I see no reason why I shouldn't tell you that he likes my stepdaughter very much."</p><p>Madame Merle gave one of her quick looks again. "Likes her, you mean--as Mr. Rosier means?"</p><p>"I don't know how Mr. Rosier means; but Lord Warburton has let me know that he's charmed with Pansy."</p><p>"And you've never told Osmond?" This observation was immediate, precipitate; it almost burst from Madame Merle's lips.</p><p>Isabel's eyes rested on her. "I suppose he'll know in time; Lord Warburton has a tongue and knows how to express himself."</p><p>Madame Merle instantly became conscious that she had spoken morequickly than usual, and the reflection brought the colour to her cheek.She gave the treacherous impulse time to subside and then said as ifshe had been thinking it over a little: "That would be better thanmarrying poor Mr. Rosier."</p><p>"Much better, I think."</p><p>"It would be very delightful; it would be a great marriage. It's really very kind of him."</p><p>"Very kind of him?"</p><p>"To drop his eyes on a simple little girl."</p><p>"I don't see that."</p><p>"It's very good of you. But after all, Pansy Osmond--"</p><p>"After all, Pansy Osmond's the most attractive person he has ever known!" Isabel exclaimed.</p><p>Madame Merle stared, and indeed she was justly bewildered. "Ah, a moment ago I thought you seemed rather to disparage her."</p><p>"I said she was limited. And so she is. And so's Lord Warburton."</p><p>"So are we all, if you come to that. If it's no more than Pansydeserves, all the better. But if she fixes her affections on Mr. RosierI won't admit that she deserves it. That will be too perverse."</p><p>"Mr. Rosier's a nuisance!" Isabel cried abruptly.</p><p>"I quite agree with you, and I'm delighted to know that I'm notexpected to feed his flame. For the future, when he calls on me, mydoor shall be closed to him." And gathering her mantle together MadameMerle prepared to depart. She was checked, however, on her progress tothe door, by an inconsequent request from Isabel.</p><p>"All the same, you know, be kind to him."</p><p>She lifted her shoulders and eyebrows and stood looking at herfriend. "I don't understand your contradictions! Decidedly I shan't bekind to him, for it will be a false kindness. I want to see her marriedto Lord Warburton."</p><p>"You had better wait till he asks her."</p><p>"If what you say's true, he'll ask her. Especially," said Madame Merle in a moment, "if you make him."</p><p>"If I make him?"</p><p>"It's quite in your power. You've great influence with him."</p><p>Isabel frowned a little. "Where did you learn that?"</p><p>"Mrs. Touchett told me. Not you--never!" said Madame Merle, smiling.</p><p>"I certainly never told you anything of the sort."</p><p>"You MIGHT have done so--so far as opportunity went--when we were byway of being confidential with each other. But you really told me verylittle; I've often thought so since."</p><p>Isabel had thought so too, and sometimes with a certainsatisfaction. But she didn't admit it now--perhaps because she wishednot to appear to exult in it. "You seem to have had an excellentinformant in my aunt," she simply returned.</p><p>"She let me know you had declined an offer of marriage from LordWarburton, because she was greatly vexed and was full of the subject.Of course I think you've done better in doing as you did. But if youwouldn't marry Lord Warburton yourself, make him the reparation ofhelping him to marry some one else."</p><p>Isabel listened to this with a face that persisted in not reflectingthe bright expressiveness of Madame Merle's. But in a moment she said,reasonably and gently enough: "I should be very glad indeed if, asregards Pansy, it could be arranged." Upon which her companion, whoseemed to regard this as a speech of good omen, embraced her moretenderly than might have been expected and triumphantly withdrew.</p></span><span id = 990 ><p>Osmond touched on this matter that evening for the first time;coming very late into the drawing-room, where she was sitting alone.They had spent the evening at home, and Pansy had gone to bed; hehimself had been sitting since dinner in a small apartment in which hehad arranged his books and which he called his study. At ten o'clockLord Warburton had come in, as he always did when he knew from Isabelthat she was to be at home; he was going somewhere else and he sat forhalf an hour. Isabel, after asking him for news of Ralph, said verylittle to him, on purpose; she wished him to talk with herstepdaughter. She pretended to read; she even went after a little tothe piano; she asked herself if she mightn't leave the room. She hadcome little by little to think well of the idea of Pansy's becoming thewife of the master of beautiful Lockleigh, though at first it had notpresented itself in a manner to excite her enthusiasm. Madame Merle,that afternoon, had applied the match to an accumulation of inflammablematerial. When Isabel was unhappy she always looked about her--partlyfrom impulse and partly by theory--for some form of positive exertion.She could never rid herself of the sense that unhappiness was a stateof disease--of suffering as opposed to doing. To "do"--it hardlymattered what--would therefore be an escape, perhaps in some degree aremedy. Besides, she wished to convince herself that she had doneeverything possible to content her husband; she was determined not tobe haunted by visions of his wife's limpness under appeal. It wouldplease him greatly to see Pansy married to an English nobleman, andjustly please him, since this nobleman was so sound a character. Itseemed to Isabel that if she could make it her duty to bring about suchan event she should play the part of a good wife. She wanted to bethat; she wanted to be able to believe sincerely, and with proof of it,that she had been that. Then such an undertaking had otherrecommendations. It would occupy her, and she desired occupation. Itwould even amuse her, and if she could really amuse herself she perhapsmight be saved. Lastly, it would be a service to Lord Warburton, whoevidently pleased himself greatly with the charming girl. It was alittle "weird" he should--being what he was; but there was noaccounting for such impressions. Pansy might captivate any one--any oneat least but Lord Warburton. Isabel would have thought her too small,too slight, perhaps even too artificial for that. There was always alittle of the doll about her, and that was not what he had been lookingfor. Still, who could say what men ever were looking for? They lookedfor what they found; they knew what pleased them only when they saw it.No theory was valid in such matters, and nothing was more unaccountableor more natural than anything else. If he had cared for HER it mightseem odd he should care for Pansy, who was so different; but he had notcared for her so much as he had supposed. Or if he had, he hadcompletely got over it, and it was natural that, as that affair hadfailed, he should think something of quite another sort might succeed.Enthusiasm, as I say, had not come at first to Isabel, but it cameto-day and made her feel almost happy. It was astonishing whathappiness she could still find in the idea of procuring a pleasure forher husband. It was a pity, however, that Edward Rosier had crossedtheir path!</p><p>At this reflection the light that had suddenly gleamed upon thatpath lost something of its brightness. Isabel was unfortunately as surethat Pansy thought Mr. Rosier the nicest of all the young men--as sureas if she had held an interview with her on the subject. It was verytiresome she should be so sure, when she had carefully abstained frominforming herself; almost as tiresome as that poor Mr. Rosier shouldhave taken it into his own head. He was certainly very inferior to LordWarburton. It was not the difference in fortune so much as thedifference in the men; the young American was really so light a weight.He was much more of the type of the useless fine gentleman than theEnglish nobleman. It was true that there was no particular reason whyPansy should marry a statesman; still, if a statesman admired her, thatwas his affair, and she would make a perfect little pearl of a peeress.</p><p>It may seem to the reader that Mrs. Osmond had grown of a suddenstrangely cynical, for she ended by saying to herself that thisdifficulty could probably be arranged. An impediment that was embodiedin poor Rosier could not anyhow present itself as a dangerous one;there were always means of levelling secondary obstacles. Isabel wasperfectly aware that she had not taken the measure of Pansy's tenacity,which might prove to be inconveniently great; but she inclined to seeher as rather letting go, under suggestion, than as clutching underdeprecation --since she had certainly the faculty of assent developedin a very much higher degree than that of protest. She would cling,yes, she would cling; but it really mattered to her very little whatshe clung to. Lord Warburton would do as well as Mr. Rosier--especially as she seemed quite to like him; she had expressed thissentiment to Isabel without a single reservation; she had said shethought his conversation most interesting--he had told her all aboutIndia. His manner to Pansy had been of the rightest and easiest--Isabelnoticed that for herself, as she also observed that he talked to hernot in the least in a patronising way, reminding himself of her youthand simplicity, but quite as if she understood his subjects with thatsufficiency with which she followed those of the fashionable operas.This went far enough for attention to the music and the barytone. Hewas careful only to be kind--he was as kind as he had been to anotherfluttered young chit at Gardencourt. A girl might well be touched bythat; she remembered how she herself had been touched, and said toherself that if she had been as simple as Pansy the impression wouldhave been deeper still. She had not been simple when she refused him;that operation had been as complicated as, later, her acceptance ofOsmond had been. Pansy, however, in spite of HER simplicity, really didunderstand, and was glad that Lord Warburton should talk to her, notabout her partners and bouquets, but about the state of Italy, thecondition of the peasantry, the famous grist-tax, the pellagra, hisimpressions of Roman society. She looked at him, as she drew her needlethrough her tapestry, with sweet submissive eyes, and when she loweredthem she gave little quiet oblique glances at his person, his hands,his feet, his clothes, as if she were considering him. Even his person,Isabel might have reminded her, was better than Mr. Rosier's. ButIsabel contented herself at such moments with wondering where thisgentleman was; he came no more at all to Palazzo Roccanera. It wassurprising, as I say, the hold it had taken of her--the idea ofassisting her husband to be pleased.</p><p>It was surprising for a variety of reasons which I shall presentlytouch upon. On the evening I speak of, while Lord Warburton sat there,she had been on the point of taking the great step of going out of theroom and leaving her companions alone. I say the great step, because itwas in this light that Gilbert Osmond would have regarded it, andIsabel was trying as much as possible to take her husband's view. Shesucceeded after a fashion, but she fell short of the point I mention.After all she couldn't rise to it; something held her and made thisimpossible. It was not exactly that it would be base or insidious; forwomen as a general thing practise such manoeuvres with a perfectly goodconscience, and Isabel was instinctively much more true than false tothe common genius of her sex. There was a vague doubt thatinterposed--a sense that she was not quite sure. So she remained in thedrawing-room, and after a while Lord Warburton went off to his party,of which he promised to give Pansy a full account on the morrow. Afterhe had gone she wondered if she had prevented something which wouldhave happened if she had absented herself for a quarter of an hour; andthen she pronounced--always mentally--that when their distinguishedvisitor should wish her to go away he would easily find means to lether know it. Pansy said nothing whatever about him after he had gone,and Isabel studiously said nothing, as she had taken a vow of reserveuntil after he should have declared himself. He was a little longer incoming to this than might seem to accord with the description he hadgiven Isabel of his feelings. Pansy went to bed, and Isabel had toadmit that she could not now guess what her stepdaughter was thinkingof. Her transparent little companion was for the moment not to be seenthrough.</p><p>She remained alone, looking at the fire, until, at the end of halfan hour, her husband came in. He moved about a while in silence andthen sat down; he looked at the fire like herself. But she now hadtransferred her eyes from the flickering flame in the chimney toOsmond's face, and she watched him while he kept his silence. Covertobservation had become a habit with her; an instinct, of which it isnot an exaggeration to say that it was allied to that of self-defence,had made it habitual. She wished as much as possible to know histhoughts, to know what he would say, beforehand, so that she mightprepare her answer. Preparing answers had not been her strong point ofold; she had rarely in this respect got further than thinkingafterwards of clever things she might have said. But she had learnedcaution--learned it in a measure from her husband's very countenance.It was the same face she had looked into with eyes equally earnestperhaps, but less penetrating, on the terrace of a Florentine villa;except that Osmond had grown slightly stouter since his marriage. Hestill, however, might strike one as very distinguished.</p><p>"Has Lord Warburton been here?" he presently asked.</p><p>"Yes, he stayed half an hour."</p><p>"Did he see Pansy?"</p><p>"Yes; he sat on the sofa beside her."</p><p>"Did he talk with her much?"</p><p>"He talked almost only to her."</p><p>"It seems to me he's attentive. Isn't that what you call it?"</p><p>"I don't call it anything," said Isabel; "I've waited for you to give it a name."</p><p>"That's a consideration you don't always show," Osmond answered after a moment.</p><p>"I've determined, this time, to try and act as you'd like. I've so often failed of that."</p><p>Osmond turned his head slowly, looking at her. "Are you trying to quarrel with me?"</p><p>"No, I'm trying to live at peace."</p><p>"Nothing's more easy; you know I don't quarrel myself."</p><p>"What do you call it when you try to make me angry?" Isabel asked.</p><p>"I don't try; if I've done so it has been the most natural thing in the world. Moreover I'm not in the least trying now."</p><p>Isabel smiled. "It doesn't matter. I've determined never to be angry again."</p><p>"That's an excellent resolve. Your temper isn't good."</p><p>"No--it's not good." She pushed away the book she had been reading and took up the band of tapestry Pansy had left on the table.</p><p>"That's partly why I've not spoken to you about this business of mydaughter's," Osmond said, designating Pansy in the manner that was mostfrequent with him. "I was afraid I should encounter opposition--thatyou too would have views on the subject. I've sent little Rosier abouthis business."</p><p>"You were afraid I'd plead for Mr. Rosier? Haven't you noticed that I've never spoken to you of him?"</p><p>"I've never given you a chance. We've so little conversation in these days. I know he was an old friend of yours."</p><p>"Yes; he's an old friend of mine." Isabel cared little more for himthan for the tapestry that she held in her hand; but it was true thathe was an old friend and that with her husband she felt a desire not toextenuate such ties. He had a way of expressing contempt for them whichfortified her loyalty to them, even when, as in the present case, theywere in themselves insignificant. She sometimes felt a sort of passionof tenderness for memories which had no other merit than that theybelonged to her unmarried life. "But as regards Pansy," she added in amoment, "I've given him no encouragement."</p><p>"That's fortunate," Osmond observed.</p><p>"Fortunate for me, I suppose you mean. For him it matters little."</p><p>"There's no use talking of him," Osmond said. "As I tell you, I've turned him out."</p><p>"Yes; but a lover outside's always a lover. He's sometimes even more of one. Mr. Rosier still has hope."</p><p>"He's welcome to the comfort of it! My daughter has only to sit perfectly quiet to become Lady Warburton."</p><p>"Should you like that?" Isabel asked with a simplicity which was notso affected as it may appear. She was resolved to assume nothing, forOsmond had a way of unexpectedly turning her assumptions against her.The intensity with which he would like his daughter to become LadyWarburton had been the very basis of her own recent reflections. Butthat was for herself; she would recognise nothing until Osmond shouldhave put it into words; she would not take for granted with him that hethought Lord Warburton a prize worth an amount of effort that wasunusual among the Osmonds. It was Gilbert's constant intimation thatfor him nothing in life was a prize; that he treated as from equal toequal with the most distinguished people in the world, and that hisdaughter had only to look about her to pick out a prince. It cost himtherefore a lapse from consistency to say explicitly that he yearnedfor Lord Warburton and that if this nobleman should escape hisequivalent might not be found; with which moreover it was another ofhis customary implications that he was never inconsistent. He wouldhave liked his wife to glide over the point. But strangely enough, nowthat she was face to face with him and although an hour before she hadalmost invented a scheme for pleasing him, Isabel was notaccommodating, would not glide. And yet she knew exactly the effect onhis mind of her question: it would operate as an humiliation. Nevermind; he was terribly capable of humiliating her--all the more so thathe was also capable of waiting for great opportunities and of showingsometimes an almost unaccountable indifference to small ones. Isabelperhaps took a small opportunity because she would not have availedherself of a great one.</p><p>Osmond at present acquitted himself very honourably. "I should likeit extremely; it would be a great marriage. And then Lord Warburton hasanother advantage: he's an old friend of yours. It would be pleasantfor him to come into the family. It's very odd Pansy's admirers shouldall be your old friends."</p><p>"It's natural that they should come to see me. In coming to see methey see Pansy. Seeing her it's natural they should fall in love withher."</p><p>"So I think. But you're not bound to do so."</p><p>"If she should marry Lord Warburton I should be very glad," Isabelwent on frankly. "He's an excellent man. You say, however, that she hasonly to sit perfectly still. Perhaps she won't sit perfectly still. Ifshe loses Mr. Rosier she may jump up!"</p><p>Osmond appeared to give no heed to this; he sat gazing at the fire."Pansy would like to be a great lady," he remarked in a moment with acertain tenderness of tone. "She wishes above all to please," he added.</p><p>"To please Mr. Rosier, perhaps."</p><p>"No, to please me."</p><p>"Me too a little, I think," said Isabel.</p><p>"Yes, she has a great opinion of you. But she'll do what I like."</p><p>"If you're sure of that, it's very well," she went on.</p><p>"Meantime," said Osmond, "I should like our distinguished visitor to speak."</p><p>"He has spoken--to me. He has told me it would be a great pleasure to him to believe she could care for him."</p><p>Osmond turned his head quickly, but at first he said nothing. Then, "Why didn't you tell me that?" he asked sharply.</p><p>"There was no opportunity. You know how we live. I've taken the first chance that has offered."</p><p>"Did you speak to him of Rosier?"</p><p>"Oh yes, a little."</p><p>"That was hardly necessary."</p><p>"I thought it best he should know, so that, so that--" And Isabel paused.</p><p>"So that what?"</p><p>"So that he might act accordingly."</p><p>"So that he might back out, do you mean?"</p><p>"No, so that he might advance while there's yet time."</p><p>"That's not the effect it seems to have had."</p><p>"You should have patience," said Isabel. "You know Englishmen are shy."</p><p>"This one's not. He was not when he made love to YOU."</p><p>She had been afraid Osmond would speak of that; it was disagreeableto her. "I beg your pardon; he was extremely so," she returned.</p><p>He answered nothing for some time; he took up a book and fingeredthe pages while she sat silent and occupied herself with Pansy'stapestry. "You must have a great deal of influence with him," Osmondwent on at last. "The moment you really wish it you can bring him tothe point."</p><p>This was more offensive still; but she felt the great naturalness ofhis saying it, and it was after all extremely like what she had said toherself. "Why should I have influence?" she asked. "What have I everdone to put him under an obligation to me?"</p><p>"You refused to marry him," said Osmond with his eyes on his book.</p><p>"I must not presume too much on that," she replied.</p><p>He threw down the book presently and got up, standing before thefire with his hands behind him. "Well, I hold that it lies in yourhands. I shall leave it there. With a little good-will you may manageit. Think that over and remember how much I count on you." He waited alittle, to give her time to answer; but she answered nothing, and hepresently strolled out of the room.</p></span><span id = 991 ><p>She had answered nothing because his words had put the situationbefore her and she was absorbed in looking at it. There was somethingin them that suddenly made vibrations deep, so that she had been afraidto trust herself to speak. After he had gone she leaned back in herchair and closed her eyes; and for a long time, far into the night andstill further, she sat in the still drawing-room, given up to hermeditation. A servant came in to attend to the fire, and she bade himbring fresh candles and then go to bed. Osmond had told her to think ofwhat he had said; and she did so indeed, and of many other things. Thesuggestion from another that she had a definite influence on LordWarburton--this had given her the start that accompanies unexpectedrecognition. Was it true that there was something still between themthat might be a handle to make him declare himself to Pansy--asusceptibility, on his part, to approval, a desire to do what wouldplease her? Isabel had hitherto not asked herself the question, becauseshe had not been forced; but now that it was directly presented to hershe saw the answer, and the answer frightened her. Yes, there wassomething--something on Lord Warburton's part. When he had first cometo Rome she believed the link that united them to be completelysnapped; but little by little she had been reminded that it had yet apalpable existence. It was as thin as a hair, but there were momentswhen she seemed to hear it vibrate. For herself nothing was changed;what she once thought of him she always thought; it was needless thisfeeling should change; it seemed to her in fact a better feeling thanever. But he? had he still the idea that she might be more to him thanother women? Had he the wish to profit by the memory of the few momentsof intimacy through which they had once passed? Isabel knew she hadread some of the signs of such a disposition. But what were his hopes,his pretensions, and in what strange way were they mingled with hisevidently very sincere appreciation of poor Pansy? Was he in love withGilbert Osmond's wife, and if so what comfort did he expect to derivefrom it? If he was in love with Pansy he was not in love with herstepmother, and if he was in love with her stepmother he was not inlove with Pansy. Was she to cultivate the advantage she possessed inorder to make him commit himself to Pansy, knowing he would do so forher sake and not for the small creature's own--was this the service herhusband had asked of her? This at any rate was the duty with which shefound herself confronted--from the moment she admitted to herself thather old friend had still an uneradicated predilection for her society.It was not an agreeable task; it was in fact a repulsive one. She askedherself with dismay whether Lord Warburton were pretending to be inlove with Pansy in order to cultivate another satisfaction and whatmight be called other chances. Of this refinement of duplicity shepresently acquitted him; she preferred to believe him in perfect goodfaith. But if his admiration for Pansy were a delusion this wasscarcely better than its being an affectation. Isabel wandered amongthese ugly possibilities until she had completely lost her way; some ofthem, as she suddenly encountered them, seemed ugly enough. Then shebroke out of the labyrinth, rubbing her eyes, and declared that herimagination surely did her little honour and that her husband's did himeven less. Lord Warburton was as disinterested as he need be, and shewas no more to him than she need wish. She would rest upon this tillthe contrary should be proved; proved more effectually than by acynical intimation of Osmond's.</p><p>Such a resolution, however, brought her this evening but littlepeace, for her soul was haunted with terrors which crowded to theforeground of thought as quickly as a place was made for them. What hadsuddenly set them into livelier motion she hardly knew, unless it werethe strange impression she had received in the afternoon of herhusband's being in more direct communication with Madame Merle than shesuspected. That impression came back to her from time to time, and nowshe wondered it had never come before. Besides this, her shortinterview with Osmond half an hour ago was a striking example of hisfaculty for making everything wither that he touched, spoilingeverything for her that he looked at. It was very well to undertake togive him a proof of loyalty; the real fact was that the knowledge ofhis expecting a thing raised a presumption against it. It was as if hehad had the evil eye; as if his presence were a blight and his favour amisfortune. Was the fault in himself, or only in the deep mistrust shehad conceived for him? This mistrust was now the clearest result oftheir short married life; a gulf had opened between them over whichthey looked at each other with eyes that were on either side adeclaration of the deception suffered. It was a strange opposition, ofthe like of which she had never dreamed--an opposition in which thevital principle of the one was a thing of contempt to the other. It wasnot her fault--she had practised no deception; she had only admired andbelieved. She had taken all the first steps in the purest confidence,and then she had suddenly found the infinite vista of a multiplied lifeto be a dark, narrow alley with a dead wall at the end. Instead ofleading to the high places of happiness, from which the world wouldseem to lie below one, so that one could look down with a sense ofexaltation and advantage, and judge and choose and pity, it led ratherdownward and earthward, into realms of restriction and depression wherethe sound of other lives, easier and freer, was heard as from above,and where it served to deepen the feeling of failure. It was her deepdistrust of her husband--this was what darkened the world. That is asentiment easily indicated, but not so easily explained, and socomposite in its character that much time and still more suffering hadbeen needed to bring it to its actual perfection. Suffering, withIsabel, was an active condition; it was not a chill, a stupor, adespair; it was a passion of thought, of speculation, of response toevery pressure. She flattered herself that she had kept her failingfaith to herself, however,--that no one suspected it but Osmond. Oh, heknew it, and there were times when she thought he enjoyed it. It hadcome gradually--it was not till the first year of their life together,so admirably intimate at first, had closed that she had taken thealarm. Then the shadows had begun to gather; it was as if Osmonddeliberately, almost malignantly, had put the lights out one by one.The dusk at first was vague and thin, and she could still see her wayin it. But it steadily deepened, and if now and again it hadoccasionally lifted there were certain corners of her prospect thatwere impenetrably black. These shadows were not an emanation from herown mind: she was very sure of that; she had done her best to be justand temperate, to see only the truth. They were a part, they were akind of creation and consequence, of her husband's very presence. Theywere not his misdeeds, his turpitudes; she accused him of nothing--that is but of one thing, which was NOT a crime. She knew of no wronghe had done; he was not violent, he was not cruel: she simply believedhe hated her. That was all she accused him of, and the miserable partof it was precisely that it was not a crime, for against a crime shemight have found redress. He had discovered that she was so different,that she was not what he had believed she would prove to be. He hadthought at first he could change her, and she had done her best to bewhat he would like. But she was, after all, herself--she couldn't helpthat; and now there was no use pretending, wearing a mask or a dress,for he knew her and had made up his mind. She was not afraid of him;she had no apprehension he would hurt her; for the ill-will he bore herwas not of that sort. He would if possible never give her a pretext,never put himself in the wrong. Isabel, scanning the future with dry,fixed eyes, saw that he would have the better of her there. She wouldgive him many pretexts, she would often put herself in the wrong. Therewere times when she almost pitied him; for if she had not deceived himin intention she understood how completely she must have done so infact. She had effaced herself when he first knew her; she had madeherself small, pretending there was less of her than there really was.It was because she had been under the extraordinary charm that he, onhis side, had taken pains to put forth. He was not changed; he had notdisguised himself, during the year of his courtship, any more than she.But she had seen only half his nature then, as one saw the disk of themoon when it was partly masked by the shadow of the earth. She saw thefull moon now--she saw the whole man. She had kept still, as it were,so that he should have a free field, and yet in spite of this she hadmistaken a part for the whole.</p><p>Ah, she had been immensely under the charm! It had not passed away;it was there still: she still knew perfectly what it was that madeOsmond delightful when he chose to be. He had wished to be when he madelove to her, and as she had wished to be charmed it was not wonderfulhe had succeeded. He had succeeded because he had been sincere; itnever occurred to her now to deny him that. He admired her--he had toldher why: because she was the most imaginative woman he had known. Itmight very well have been true; for during those months she hadimagined a world of things that had no substance. She had had a morewondrous vision of him, fed through charmed senses and oh such astirred fancy!--she had not read him right. A certain combination offeatures had touched her, and in them she had seen the most striking offigures. That he was poor and lonely and yet that somehow he wasnoble--that was what had interested her and seemed to give her heropportunity. There had been an indefinable beauty about him--in hissituation, in his mind, in his face. She had felt at the same time thathe was helpless and ineffectual, but the feeling had taken the form ofa tenderness which was the very flower of respect. He was like asceptical voyager strolling on the beach while he waited for the tide,looking seaward yet not putting to sea. It was in all this she hadfound her occasion. She would launch his boat for him; she would be hisprovidence; it would be a good thing to love him. And she had lovedhim, she had so anxiously and yet so ardently given herself--a gooddeal for what she found in him, but a good deal also for what shebrought him and what might enrich the gift. As she looked back at thepassion of those full weeks she perceived in it a kind of maternalstrain--the happiness of a woman who felt that she was a contributor,that she came with charged hands. But for her money, as she saw to-day,she would never have done it. And then her mind wandered off to poorMr. Touchett, sleeping under English turf, the beneficent author ofinfinite woe! For this was the fantastic fact. At bottom her money hadbeen a burden, had been on her mind, which was filled with the desireto transfer the weight of it to some other conscience, to some moreprepared receptacle. What would lighten her own conscience moreeffectually than to make it over to the man with the best taste in theworld? Unless she should have given it to a hospital there would havebeen nothing better she could do with it; and there was no charitableinstitution in which she had been as much interested as in GilbertOsmond. He would use her fortune in a way that would make her thinkbetter of it and rub off a certain grossness attaching to the good luckof an unexpected inheritance. There had been nothing very delicate ininheriting seventy thousand pounds; the delicacy had been all in Mr.Touchett's leaving them to her. But to marry Gilbert Osmond and bringhim such a portion--in that there would be delicacy for her as well.There would be less for him--that was true; but that was his affair,and if he loved her he wouldn't object to her being rich. Had he nothad the courage to say he was glad she was rich?</p><p>Isabel's cheek burned when she asked herself if she had reallymarried on a factitious theory, in order to do something finelyappreciable with her money. But she was able to answer quickly enoughthat this was only half the story. It was because a certain ardour tookpossession of her--a sense of the earnestness of his affection and adelight in his personal qualities. He was better than any one else.This supreme conviction had filled her life for months, and enough ofit still remained to prove to her that she could not have doneotherwise. The finest--in the sense of being the subtlest--manlyorganism she had ever known had become her property, and therecognition of her having but to put out her hands and take it had beenoriginally a sort of act of devotion. She had not been mistaken aboutthe beauty of his mind; she knew that organ perfectly now. She hadlived with it, she had lived IN it almost--it appeared to have becomeher habitation. If she had been captured it had taken a firm hand toseize her; that reflection perhaps had some worth. A mind moreingenious, more pliant, more cultivated, more trained to admirableexercises, she had not encountered; and it was this exquisiteinstrument she had now to reckon with. She lost herself in infinitedismay when she thought of the magnitude of HIS deception. It was awonder, perhaps, in view of this, that he didn't hate her more. Sheremembered perfectly the first sign he had given of it--it had beenlike the bell that was to ring up the curtain upon the real drama oftheir life. He said to her one day that she had too many ideas and thatshe must get rid of them. He had told her that already, before theirmarriage; but then she had not noticed it: it had come back to her onlyafterwards. This time she might well have noticed it, because he hadreally meant it. The words had been nothing superficially; but when inthe light of deepening experience she had looked into them they hadthen appeared portentous. He had really meant it--he would have likedher to have nothing of her own but her pretty appearance. She had knownshe had too many ideas; she had more even than he had supposed, manymore than she had expressed to him when he had asked her to marry him.Yes, she HAD been hypocritical; she had liked him so much. She had toomany ideas for herself; but that was just what one married for, toshare them with some one else. One couldn't pluck them up by the roots,though of course one might suppress them, be careful not to utter them.It had not been this, however, his objecting to her opinions; this hadbeen nothing. She had no opinions--none that she would not have beeneager to sacrifice in the satisfaction of feeling herself loved for it.What he had meant had been the whole thing--her character, the way shefelt, the way she judged. This was what she had kept in reserve; thiswas what he had not known until he had found himself--with the doorclosed behind, as it were--set down face to face with it. She had acertain way of looking at life which he took as a personal offence.Heaven knew that now at least it was a very humble, accommodating way!The strange thing was that she should not have suspected from the firstthat his own had been so different. She had thought it so large, soenlightened, so perfectly that of an honest man and a gentleman. Hadn'the assured her that he had no superstitions, no dull limitations, noprejudices that had lost their freshness? Hadn't he all the appearanceof a man living in the open air of the world, indifferent to smallconsiderations, caring only for truth and knowledge and believing thattwo intelligent people ought to look for them together and, whetherthey found them or not, find at least some happiness in the search? Hehad told her he loved the conventional; but there was a sense in whichthis seemed a noble declaration. In that sense, that of the love ofharmony and order and decency and of all the stately offices of life,she went with him freely, and his warning had contained nothingominous. But when, as the months had elapsed, she had followed himfurther and he had led her into the mansion of his own habitation,then, THEN she had seen where she really was.</p><p>She could live it over again, the incredulous terror with which shehad taken the measure of her dwelling. Between those four walls she hadlived ever since; they were to surround her for the rest of her life.It was the house of darkness, the house of dumbness, the house ofsuffocation. Osmond's beautiful mind gave it neither light nor air;Osmond's beautiful mind indeed seemed to peep down from a small highwindow and mock at her. Of course it had not been physical suffering;for physical suffering there might have been a remedy. She could comeand go; she had her liberty; her husband was perfectly polite. He tookhimself so seriously; it was something appalling. Under all hisculture, his cleverness, his amenity, under his good-nature, hisfacility, his knowledge of life, his egotism lay hidden like a serpentin a bank of flowers. She had taken him seriously, but she had nottaken him so seriously as that. How could she--especially when she hadknown him better? She was to think of him as he thought of himself--asthe first gentleman in Europe. So it was that she had thought of him atfirst, and that indeed was the reason she had married him. But when shebegan to see what it implied she drew back; there was more in the bondthan she had meant to put her name to. It implied a sovereign contemptfor every one but some three or four very exalted people whom heenvied, and for everything in the world but half a dozen ideas of hisown. That was very well; she would have gone with him even there a longdistance; for he pointed out to her so much of the baseness andshabbiness of life, opened her eyes so wide to the stupidity, thedepravity, the ignorance of mankind, that she had been properlyimpressed with the infinite vulgarity of things and of the virtue ofkeeping one's self unspotted by it. But this base, if noble world, itappeared, was after all what one was to live for; one was to keep itforever in one's eye, in order not to enlighten or convert or redeemit, but to extract from it some recognition of one's own superiority.On the one hand it was despicable, but on the other it afforded astandard. Osmond had talked to Isabel about his renunciation, hisindifference, the ease with which he dispensed with the usual aids tosuccess; and all this had seemed to her admirable. She had thought it agrand indifference, an exquisite independence. But indifference wasreally the last of his qualities; she had never seen any one whothought so much of others. For herself, avowedly, the world had alwaysinterested her and the study of her fellow creatures been her constantpassion. She would have been willing, however, to renounce all hercuriosities and sympathies for the sake of a personal life, if theperson concerned had only been able to make her believe it was a gain!This at least was her present conviction; and the thing certainly wouldhave been easier than to care for society as Osmond cared for it.</p><p>He was unable to live without it, and she saw that he had neverreally done so; he had looked at it out of his window even when heappeared to be most detached from it. He had his ideal, just as she hadtried to have hers; only it was strange that people should seek forjustice in such different quarters. His ideal was a conception of highprosperity and propriety, of the aristocratic life, which she now sawthat he deemed himself always, in essence at least, to have led. He hadnever lapsed from it for an hour; he would never have recovered fromthe shame of doing so. That again was very well; here too she wouldhave agreed; but they attached such different ideas, such differentassociations and desires, to the same formulas. Her notion of thearistocratic life was simply the union of great knowledge with greatliberty; the knowledge would give one a sense of duty and the liberty asense of enjoyment. But for Osmond it was altogether a thing of forms,a conscious, calculated attitude. He was fond of the old, theconsecrated, the transmitted; so was she, but she pretended to do whatshe chose with it. He had an immense esteem for tradition; he had toldher once that the best thing in the world was to have it, but that ifone was so unfortunate as not to have it one must immediately proceedto make it. She knew that he meant by this that she hadn't it, but thathe was better off; though from what source he had derived histraditions she never learned. He had a very large collection of them,however; that was very certain, and after a little she began to see.The great thing was to act in accordance with them; the great thing notonly for him but for her. Isabel had an undefined conviction that toserve for another person than their proprietor traditions must be of athoroughly superior kind; but she nevertheless assented to thisintimation that she too must march to the stately music that floateddown from unknown periods in her husband's past; she who of old hadbeen so free of step, so desultory, so devious, so much the reverse ofprocessional. There were certain things they must do, a certain posturethey must take, certain people they must know and not know. When shesaw this rigid system close about her, draped though it was in picturedtapestries, that sense of darkness and suffocation of which I havespoken took possession of her; she seemed shut up with an odour ofmould and decay. She had resisted of course; at first very humorously,ironically, tenderly; then, as the situation grew more serious,eagerly, passionately, pleadingly. She had pleaded the cause offreedom, of doing as they chose, of not caring for the aspect anddenomination of their life--the cause of other instincts and longings,of quite another ideal.</p><p>Then it was that her husband's personality, touched as it never hadbeen, stepped forth and stood erect. The things she had said wereanswered only by his scorn, and she could see he was ineffably ashamedof her. What did he think of her--that she was base, vulgar, ignoble?He at least knew now that she had no traditions! It had not been inhsis prevision of things that she should reveal such flatness; hersentiments were worthy of a radical newspaper or a Unitarian preacher.The real offence, as she ultimately perceived, was her having a mind ofher own at all. Her mind was to be his--attached to his own like asmall garden-plot to a deer-park. He would rake the soil gently andwater the flowers; he would weed the beds and gather an occasionalnosegay. It would be a pretty piece of property for a proprietoralready far-reaching. He didn't wish her to be stupid. On the contrary,it was because she was clever that she had pleased him. But he expectedher intelligence to operate altogether in his favour, and so far fromdesiring her mind to be a blank he had flattered himself that it wouldbe richly receptive. He had expected his wife to feel with him and forhim, to enter into his opinions, his ambitions, his preferences; andIsabel was obliged to confess that this was no great insolence on thepart of a man so accomplished and a husband originally at least sotender. But there were certain things she could never take in. To beginwith, they were hideously unclean. She was not a daughter of thePuritans, but for all that she believed in such a thing as chastity andeven as decency. It would appear that Osmond was far from doinganything of the sort; some of his traditions made her push back herskirts. Did all women have lovers? Did they all lie and even the besthave their price? Were there only three or four that didn't deceivetheir husbands? When Isabel heard such things she felt a greater scornfor them than for the gossip of a village parlour--a scorn that keptits freshness in a very tainted air. There was the taint of hersister-in-law: did her husband judge only by the Countess Gemini? Thislady very often lied, and she had practised deceptions that were notsimply verbal. It was enough to find these facts assumed among Osmond'straditions--it was enough without giving them such a general extension.It was her scorn of his assumptions, it was this that made him drawhimself up. He had plenty of contempt, and it was proper his wifeshould be as well furnished; but that she should turn the hot light ofher disdain upon his own conception of things--this was a danger he hadnot allowed for. He believed he should have regulated her emotionsbefore she came to it; and Isabel could easily imagine how his ears hadscorched on his discovering he had been too confident. When one had awife who gave one that sensation there was nothing left but to hate her.</p><p>She was morally certain now that this feeling of hatred, which atfirst had been a refuge and a refreshment, had become the occupationand comfort of his life. The feeling was deep, because it was sincere;he had had the revelation that she could after all dispense with him.If to herself the idea was startling, if it presented itself at firstas a kind of infidelity, a capacity for pollution, what infinite effectmight it not be expected to have had upon HIM? It was very simple; hedespised her; she had no traditions and the moral horizon of aUnitarian minister. Poor Isabel, who had never been able to understandUnitarianism! This was the certitude she had been living with now for atime that she had ceased to measure. What was coming--what was beforethem? That was her constant question. What would he do--what ought SHEto do? When a man hated his wife what did it lead to? She didn't hatehim, that she was sure of, for every little while she felt a passionatewish to give him a pleasant surprise. Very often, however, she feltafraid, and it used to come over her, as I have intimated, that she haddeceived him at the very first. They were strangely married, at allevents, and it was a horrible life. Until that morning he had scarcelyspoken to her for a week; his manner was as dry as a burned-out fire.She knew there was a special reason; he was displeased at RalphTouchett's staying on in Rome. He thought she saw too much of hercousin--he had told her a week before it was indecent she should go tohim at his hotel. He would have said more than this if Ralph's invalidstate had not appeared to make it brutal to denounce him; but havinghad to contain himself had only deepened his disgust. Isabel read allthis as she would have read the hour on the clock-face; she was asperfectly aware that the sight of her interest in her cousin stirredher husband's rage as if Osmond had locked her into her room--which shewas sure was what he wanted to do. It was her honest belief that on thewhole she was not defiant, but she certainly couldn't pretend to beindifferent to Ralph. She believed he was dying at last and that sheshould never see him again, and this gave her a tenderness for him thatshe had never known before. Nothing was a pleasure to her now; howcould anything be a pleasure to a woman who knew that she had thrownaway her life? There was an everlasting weight on her heart-- there wasa livid light on everything. But Ralph's little visit was a lamp in thedarkness; for the hour that she sat with him her ache for herselfbecame somehow her ache for HIM. She felt to-day as if he had been herbrother. She had never had a brother, but if she had and she were introuble and he were dying, he would be dear to her as Ralph was. Ahyes, if Gilbert was jealous of her there was perhaps some reason; itdidn't make Gilbert look better to sit for half an hour with Ralph. Itwas not that they talked of him--it was not that she complained. Hisname was never uttered between them. It was simply that Ralph wasgenerous and that her husband was not. There was something in Ralph'stalk, in his smile, in the mere fact of his being in Rome, that madethe blasted circle round which she walked more spacious. He made herfeel the good of the world; he made her feel what might have been. Hewas after all as intelligent as Osmond--quite apart from his beingbetter. And thus it seemed to her an act of devotion to conceal hermisery from him. She concealed it elaborately; she was perpetually, intheir talk, hanging out curtains and before her again--it lived beforeher again,--it had never had time to die--that morning in the garden atFlorence when he had warned her against Osmond. She had only to closeher eyes to see the place, to hear his voice, to feel the warm, sweetair. How could he have known? What a mystery, what a wonder of wisdom!As intelligent as Gilbert? He was much more intelligent--to arrive atsuch a judgement as that. Gilbert had never been so deep, so just. Shehad told him then that from her at least he should never know if he wasright; and this was what she was taking care of now. It gave her plentyto do; there was passion, exaltation, religion in it. Women find theirreligion sometimes in strange exercises, and Isabel at present, inplaying a part before her cousin, had an idea that she was doing him akindness. It would have been a kindness perhaps if he had been for asingle instant a dupe. As it was, the kindness consisted mainly intrying to make him believe that he had once wounded her greatly andthat the event had put him to shame, but that, as she was very generousand he was so ill, she bore him no grudge and even consideratelyforbore to flaunt her happiness in his face. Ralph smiled to himself,as he lay on his sofa, at this extraordinary form of consideration; buthe forgave her for having forgiven him. She didn't wish him to have thepain of knowing she was unhappy: that was the great thing, and itdidn't matter that such knowledge would rather have righted him.</p><p>For herself, she lingered in the soundless saloon long after thefire had gone out. There was no danger of her feeling the cold; she wasin a fever. She heard the small hours strike, and then the great ones,but her vigil took no heed of time. Her mind, assailed by visions, wasin a state of extraordinary activity, and her visions might as wellcome to her there, where she sat up to meet them, as on her pillow, tomake a mockery of rest. As I have said, she believed she was notdefiant, and what could be a better proof of it than that she shouldlinger there half the night, trying to persuade herself that there wasno reason why Pansy shouldn't be married as you would put a letter inthe post-office? When the clock struck four she got up; she was goingto bed at last, for the lamp had long since gone out and the candlesburned down to their sockets. But even then she stopped again in themiddle of the room and stood there gazing at a remembered vision--thatof her husband and Madame Merle unconsciously and familiarly associated.</p></span><span id = 992 ><p>Three nights after this she took Pansy to a great party, to whichOsmond, who never went to dances, did not accompany them. Pansy was asready for a dance as ever; she was not of a generalising turn and hadnot extended to other pleasures the interdict she had seen placed onthose of love. If she was biding her time or hoping to circumvent herfather she must have had a prevision of success. Isabel thought thisunlikely; it was much more likely that Pansy had simply determined tobe a good girl. She had never had such a chance, and she had a properesteem for chances. She carried herself no less attentively than usualand kept no less anxious an eye upon her vaporous skirts; she held herbouquet very tight and counted over the flowers for the twentieth time.She made Isabel feel old; it seemed so long since she had been in aflutter about a ball. Pansy, who was greatly admired, was never in wantof partners, and very soon after their arrival she gave Isabel, who wasnot dancing, her bouquet to hold. Isabel had rendered her this servicefor some minutes when she became aware of the near presence of EdwardRosier. He stood before her; he had lost his affable smile and wore alook of almost military resolution. The change in his appearance wouldhave made Isabel smile if she had not felt his case to be at bottom ahard one: he had always smelt so much more of heliotrope than ofgunpowder. He looked at her a moment somewhat fiercely, as if to notifyher he was dangerous, and then dropped his eyes on her bouquet. Afterhe had inspected it his glance softened and he said quickly: "It's allpansies; it must be hers!"</p><p>Isabel smiled kindly. "Yes, it's hers; she gave it to me to hold."</p><p>"May I hold it a little, Mrs. Osmond?" the poor young man asked.</p><p>"No, I can't trust you; I'm afraid you wouldn't give it back."</p><p>"I'm not sure that I should; I should leave the house with it instantly. But may I not at least have a single flower?"</p><p>Isabel hesitated a moment, and then, smiling still, held out thebouquet. "Choose one yourself. It's frightful what I'm doing for you."</p><p>"Ah, if you do no more than this, Mrs. Osmond!" Rosier exclaimed with his glass in one eye, carefully choosing his flower.</p><p>"Don't put it into your button-hole," she said. "Don't for the world!"</p><p>"I should like her to see it. She has refused to dance with me, but I wish to show her that I believe in her still."</p><p>"It's very well to show it to her, but it's out of place to show it to others. Her father has told her not to dance with you."</p><p>"And is that all YOU can do for me? I expected more from you, Mrs.Osmond," said the young man in a tone of fine general reference. "Youknow our acquaintance goes back very far--quite into the days of ourinnocent childhood."</p><p>"Don't make me out too old," Isabel patiently answered. "You comeback to that very often, and I've never denied it. But I must tell youthat, old friends as we are, if you had done me the honour to ask me tomarry you I should have refused you on the spot."</p><p>"Ah, you don't esteem me then. Say at once that you think me a mere Parisian trifler!"</p><p>"I esteem you very much, but I'm not in love with you. What I meanby that, of course, is that I'm not in love with you for Pansy."</p><p>"Very good; I see. You pity me--that's all." And Edward Rosierlooked all round, inconsequently, with his single glass. It was arevelation to him that people shouldn't be more pleased; but he was atleast too proud to show that the deficiency struck him as general.</p><p>Isabel for a moment said nothing. His manner and appearance had notthe dignity of the deepest tragedy; his little glass, among otherthings, was against that. But she suddenly felt touched; her ownunhappiness, after all, had something in common with his, and it cameover her, more than before, that here, in recognisable, if not inromantic form, was the most affecting thing in the world--young lovestruggling with adversity. "Would you really be very kind to her?" shefinally asked in a low tone.</p><p>He dropped his eyes devoutly and raised the little flower that heheld in his fingers to his lips. Then he looked at her. "You pity me;but don't you pity HER a little?"</p><p>"I don't know; I'm not sure. She'll always enjoy life."</p><p>"It will depend on what you call life!" Mr. Rosier effectively said. "She won't enjoy being tortured."</p><p>"There'll be nothing of that."</p><p>"I'm glad to hear it. She knows what she's about. You'll see."</p><p>"I think she does, and she'll never disobey her father. But she'scoming back to me," Isabel added, "and I must beg you to go away."</p><p>Rosier lingered a moment till Pansy came in sight on the arm of hercavalier; he stood just long enough to look her in the face. Then hewalked away, holding up his head; and the manner in which he achievedthis sacrifice to expediency convinced Isabel he was very much in love.</p><p>Pansy, who seldom got disarranged in dancing, looking perfectlyfresh and cool after this exercise, waited a moment and then took backher bouquet. Isabel watched her and saw she was counting the flowers;whereupon she said to herself that decidedly there were deeper forcesat play than she had recognised. Pansy had seen Rosier turn away, butshe said nothing to Isabel about him; she talked only of her partner,after he had made his bow and retired; of the music, the floor, therare misfortune of having already torn her dress. Isabel was sure,however, she had discovered her lover to have abstracted a flower;though this knowledge was not needed to account for the dutiful gracewith which she responded to the appeal of her next partner. Thatperfect amenity under acute constraint was part of a larger system. Shewas again led forth by a flushed young man, this time carrying herbouquet; and she had not been absent many minutes when Isabel saw LordWarburton advancing through the crowd. He presently drew near and badeher good-evening; she had not seen him since the day before. He lookedabout him, and then "Where's the little maid?" he asked. It was in thismanner that he had formed the harmless habit of alluding to Miss Osmond.</p><p>"She's dancing," said Isabel. "You'll see her somewhere."</p><p>He looked among the dancers and at last caught Pansy's eye. "Shesees me, but she won't notice me," he then remarked. "Are you notdancing?"</p><p>"As you see, I'm a wall-flower."</p><p>"Won't you dance with me?"</p><p>"Thank you; I'd rather you should dance with the little maid."</p><p>"One needn't prevent the other--especially as she's engaged."</p><p>"She's not engaged for everything, and you can reserve yourself. She dances very hard, and you'll be the fresher."</p><p>"She dances beautifully," said Lord Warburton, following her withhis eyes. "Ah, at last," he added, "she has given me a smile." He stoodthere with his handsome, easy, important physiognomy; and as Isabelobserved him it came over her, as it had done before, that it wasstrange a man of his mettle should take an interest in a little maid.It struck her as a great incongruity; neither Pansy's smallfascinations, nor his own kindness, his good-nature, not even his needfor amusement, which was extreme and constant, were sufficient toaccount for it. "I should like to dance with you," he went on in amoment, turning back to Isabel; "but I think I like even better to talkwith you."</p><p>"Yes, it's better, and it's more worthy of your dignity. Great statesmen oughtn't to waltz."</p><p>"Don't be cruel. Why did you recommend me then to dance with Miss Osmond?"</p><p>"Ah, that's different. If you danced with her it would look simplylike a piece of kindness--as if you were doing it for her amusement. Ifyou dance with me you'll look as if you were doing it for your own."</p><p>"And pray haven't I a right to amuse myself?"</p><p>"No, not with the affairs of the British Empire on your hands."</p><p>"The British Empire be hanged! You're always laughing at it."</p><p>"Amuse yourself with talking to me," said Isabel.</p><p>"I'm not sure it's really a recreation. You're too pointed; I'vealways to be defending myself. And you strike me as more than usuallydangerous to-night. Will you absolutely not dance?"</p><p>"I can't leave my place. Pansy must find me here."</p><p>He was silent a little. "You're wonderfully good to her," he said suddenly.</p><p>Isabel stared a little and smiled. "Can you imagine one's not being?"</p><p>"No indeed. I know how one is charmed with her. But you must have done a great deal for her."</p><p>"I've taken her out with me," said Isabel, smiling still. "And I've seen that she has proper clothes."</p><p>"Your society must have been a great benefit to her. You've talked to her, advised her, helped her to develop."</p><p>"Ah yes, if she isn't the rose she has lived near it."</p><p>She laughed, and her companion did as much; but there was a certainvisible preoccupation in his face which interfered with completehilarity. "We all try to live as near it as we can," he said after amoment's hesitation.</p><p>Isabel turned away; Pansy was about to be restored to her, and shewelcomed the diversion. We know how much she liked Lord Warburton; shethought him pleasanter even than the sum of his merits warranted; therewas something in his friendship that appeared a kind of resource incase of indefinite need; it was like having a large balance at thebank. She felt happier when he was in the room; there was somethingreassuring in his approach; the sound of his voice reminded her of thebeneficence of nature. Yet for all that it didn't suit her that heshould be too near her, that he should take too much of her good-willfor granted. She was afraid of that; she averted herself from it; shewished he wouldn't. She felt that if he should come too near, as itwere, it might be in her to flash out and bid him keep his distance.Pansy came back to Isabel with another rent in her skirt, which was theinevitable consequence of the first and which she displayed to Isabelwith serious eyes. There were too many gentlemen in uniform; they worethose dreadful spurs, which were fatal to the dresses of little maids.It hereupon became apparent that the resources of women areinnumerable. Isabel devoted herself to Pansy's desecrated drapery; shefumbled for a pin and repaired the injury; she smiled and listened toher account of her adventures. Her attention, her sympathy wereimmediate and active; and they were in direct proportion to a sentimentwith which they were in no way connected--a lively conjecture as towhether Lord Warburton might be trying to make love to her. It was notsimply his words just then; it was others as well; it was the referenceand the continuity. This was what she thought about while she pinned upPansy's dress. If it were so, as she feared, he was of courseunwitting; he himself had not taken account of his intention. But thismade it none the more auspicious, made the situation none lessimpossible. The sooner he should get back into right relations withthings the better. He immediately began to talk to Pansy--on whom itwas certainly mystifying to see that he dropped a smile of chasteneddevotion. Pansy replied, as usual, with a little air of conscientiousaspiration; he had to bend toward her a good deal in conversation, andher eyes, as usual, wandered up and down his robust person as if he hadoffered it to her for exhibition. She always seemed a littlefrightened; yet her fright was not of the painful character thatsuggests dislike; on the contrary, she looked as if she knew that heknew she liked him. Isabel left them together a little and wanderedtoward a friend whom she saw near and with whom she talked till themusic of the following dance began, for which she knew Pansy to be alsoengaged. The girl joined her presently, with a little fluttered flush,and Isabel, who scrupulously took Osmond's view of his daughter'scomplete dependence, consigned her, as a precious and momentary loan,to her appointed partner. About all this matter she had her ownimaginations, her own reserves; there were moments when Pansy's extremeadhesiveness made each of them, to her sense, look foolish. But Osmondhad given her a sort of tableau of her position as his daughter'sduenna, which consisted of gracious alternations of concession andcontraction; and there were directions of his which she liked to thinkshe obeyed to the letter. Perhaps, as regards some of them, it wasbecause her doing so appeared to reduce them to the absurd.</p><p>After Pansy had been led away, she found Lord Warburton drawing nearher again. She rested her eyes on him steadily; she wished she couldsound his thoughts. But he had no appearance of confusion. "She haspromised to dance with me later," he said.</p><p>"I'm glad of that. I suppose you've engaged her for the cotillion."</p><p>At this he looked a little awkward. "No, I didn't ask her for that. It's a quadrille."</p><p>"Ah, you're not clever!" said Isabel almost angrily. "I told her to keep the cotillion in case you should ask for it."</p><p>"Poor little maid, fancy that!" And Lord Warburton laughed frankly. "Of course I will if you like."</p><p>"If I like? Oh, if you dance with her only because I like it--!"</p><p>"I'm afraid I bore her. She seems to have a lot of young fellows on her book."</p><p>Isabel dropped her eyes, reflecting rapidly; Lord Warburton stoodthere looking at her and she felt his eyes on her face. She felt muchinclined to ask him to remove them. She didn't do so, however; she onlysaid to him, after a minute, with her own raised: "Please let meunderstand."</p><p>"Understand what?"</p><p>"You told me ten days ago that you'd like to marry my stepdaughter. You've not forgotten it!"</p><p>"Forgotten it? I wrote to Mr. Osmond about it this morning."</p><p>"Ah," said Isabel, "he didn't mention to me that he had heard from you."</p><p>Lord Warburton stammered a little. "I--I didn't send my letter."</p><p>"Perhaps you forgot THAT."</p><p>"No, I wasn't satisfied with it. It's an awkward sort of letter to write, you know. But I shall send it to-night."</p><p>"At three o'clock in the morning?"</p><p>"I mean later, in the course of the day."</p><p>"Very good. You still wish then to marry her?"</p><p>"Very much indeed."</p><p>"Aren't you afraid that you'll bore her?" And as her companionstared at this enquiry Isabel added: "If she can't dance with you forhalf an hour how will she be able to dance with you for life?"</p><p>"Ah," said Lord Warburton readily, "I'll let her dance with otherpeople! About the cotillion, the fact is I thought that you-- thatyou--"</p><p>"That I would do it with you? I told you I'd do nothing."</p><p>"Exactly; so that while it's going on I might find some quiet corner where we may sit down and talk."</p><p>"Oh," said Isabel gravely, "you're much too considerate of me."</p><p>When the cotillion came Pansy was found to have engaged herself,thinking, in perfect humility, that Lord Warburton had no intentions.Isabel recommended him to seek another partner, but he assured her thathe would dance with no one but herself. As, however, she had, in spiteof the remonstrances of her hostess, declined other invitations on theground that she was not dancing at all, it was not possible for her tomake an exception in Lord Warburton's favour.</p><p>"After all I don't care to dance," he said; "it's a barbarousamusement: I'd much rather talk." And he intimated that he haddiscovered exactly the corner he had been looking for--a quiet nook inone of the smaller rooms, where the music would come to them faintlyand not interfere with conversation. Isabel had decided to let himcarry out his idea; she wished to be satisfied. She wandered away fromthe ball-room with him, though she knew her husband desired she shouldnot lose sight of his daughter. It was with his daughter's pretendant,however; that would make it right for Osmond. On her way out of theball-room she came upon Edward Rosier, who was standing in a doorway,with folded arms, looking at the dance in the attitude of a young manwithout illusions. She stopped a moment and asked him if he were notdancing.</p><p>"Certainly not, if I can't dance with HER!" he answered.</p><p>"You had better go away then," said Isabel with the manner of good counsel.</p><p>"I shall not go till she does!" And he let Lord Warburton pass without giving him a look.</p><p>This nobleman, however, had noticed the melancholy youth, and heasked Isabel who her dismal friend was, remarking that he had seen himsomewhere before.</p><p>"It's the young man I've told you about, who's in love with Pansy."</p><p>"Ah yes, I remember. He looks rather bad."</p><p>"He has reason. My husband won't listen to him."</p><p>"What's the matter with him?" Lord Warburton enquired. "He seems very harmless."</p><p>"He hasn't money enough, and he isn't very clever."</p><p>Lord Warburton listened with interest; he seemed struck with thisaccount of Edward Rosier. "Dear me; he looked a well-set-up youngfellow."</p><p>"So he is, but my husband's very particular."</p><p>"Oh, I see." And Lord Warburton paused a moment. "How much money has he got?" he then ventured to ask.</p><p>"Some forty thousand francs a year."</p><p>"Sixteen hundred pounds? Ah, but that's very good, you know."</p><p>"So I think. My husband, however, has larger ideas."</p><p>"Yes; I've noticed that your husband has very large ideas. Is he really an idiot, the young man?"</p><p>"An idiot? Not in the least; he's charming. When he was twelve years old I myself was in love with him."</p><p>"He doesn't look much more than twelve to-day," Lord Warburtonrejoined vaguely, looking about him. Then with more point, "Don't youthink we might sit here?" he asked.</p><p>"Wherever you please." The room was a sort of boudoir, pervaded by asubdued, rose-coloured light; a lady and gentleman moved out of it asour friends came in. "It's very kind of you to take such an interest inMr. Rosier," Isabel said.</p><p>"He seems to me rather ill-treated. He had a face a yard long. I wondered what ailed him."</p><p>"You're a just man," said Isabel. "You've a kind thought even for a rival."</p><p>Lord Warburton suddenly turned with a stare. "A rival! Do you call him my rival?"</p><p>"Surely--if you both wish to marry the same person."</p><p>"Yes--but since he has no chance!"</p><p>"I like you, however that may be, for putting your self in his place. It shows imagination."</p><p>"You like me for it?" And Lord Warburton looked at her with an uncertain eye. "I think you mean you're laughing at me for it."</p><p>"Yes, I'm laughing at you a little. But I like you as somebody to laugh at."</p><p>"Ah well, then, let me enter into his situation a little more. What do you suppose one could do for him?"</p><p>"Since I have been praising your imagination I'll leave you toimagine that yourself," Isabel said. "Pansy too would like you forthat."</p><p>"Miss Osmond? Ah, she, I flatter myself, likes me already."</p><p>"Very much, I think."</p><p>He waited a little; he was still questioning her face. "Well then, Idon't understand you. You don't mean that she cares for him?"</p><p>A quick blush sprang to his brow. "You told me she would have nowish apart from her father's, and as I've gathered that he would favourme--!" He paused a little and then suggested "Don't you see?" throughhis blush.</p><p>"Yes, I told you she has an immense wish to please her father, and that it would probably take her very far."</p><p>"That seems to me a very proper feeling," said Lord Warburton.</p><p>"Certainly; it's a very proper feeling." Isabel remained silent forsome moments; the room continued empty; the sound of the music reachedthem with its richness softened by the interposing apartments. Then atlast she said: "But it hardly strikes me as the sort of feeling towhich a man would wish to be indebted for a wife."</p><p>"I don't know; if the wife's a good one and he thinks she does well!"</p><p>"Yes, of course you must think that."</p><p>"I do; I can't help it. You call that very British, of course."</p><p>"No, I don't. I think Pansy would do wonderfully well to marry you,and I don't know who should know it better than you. But you're not inlove."</p><p>"Ah, yes I am, Mrs. Osmond!"</p><p>Isabel shook her head. "You like to think you are while you sit here with me. But that's not how you strike me."</p><p>"I'm not like the young man in the doorway. I admit that. But whatmakes it so unnatural? Could any one in the world be more loveable thanMiss Osmond?"</p><p>"No one, possibly. But love has nothing to do with good reasons."</p><p>"I don't agree with you. I'm delighted to have good reasons."</p><p>"Of course you are. If you were really in love you wouldn't care a straw for them."</p><p>"Ah, really in love--really in love!" Lord Warburton exclaimed,folding his arms, leaning back his head and stretching himself alittle. "You must remember that I'm forty-two years old. I won'tpretend I'm as I once was."</p><p>"Well, if you're sure," said Isabel, "it's all right."</p><p>He answered nothing; he sat there, with his head back, lookingbefore him. Abruptly, however, he changed his position; he turnedquickly to his friend. "Why are you so unwilling, so sceptical?" Shemet his eyes, and for a moment they looked straight at each other. Ifshe wished to be satisfied she saw something that satisfied her; shesaw in his expression the gleam of an idea that she was uneasy on herown account--that she was perhaps even in fear. It showed a suspicion,not a hope, but such as it was it told her what she wanted to know. Notfor an instant should he suspect her of detecting in his proposal ofmarrying her step-daughter an implication of increased nearness toherself, or of thinking it, on such a betrayal, ominous. In that brief,extremely personal gaze, however, deeper meanings passed between themthan they were conscious of at the moment.</p><p>"My dear Lord Warburton," she said, smiling, "you may do, so far as I'm concerned, whatever comes into your head."</p><p>And with this she got up and wandered into the adjoining room,where, within her companion's view, she was immediately addressed by apair of gentlemen, high personages in the Roman world, who met her asif they had been looking for her. While she talked with them she foundherself regretting she had moved; it looked a little like runningaway--all the more as Lord Warburton didn't follow her. She was glad ofthis, however, and at any rate she was satisfied. She was so wellsatisfied that when, in passing back into the ball-room, she foundEdward Rosier still planted in the doorway, she stopped and spoke tohim again. "You did right not to go away. I've some comfort for you."</p><p>"I need it," the young man softly wailed, "when I see you so awfully thick with him!"</p><p>"Don't speak of him; I'll do what I can for you. I'm afraid it won't be much, but what I can I'll do."</p><p>He looked at her with gloomy obliqueness. "What has suddenly brought you round?"</p><p>"The sense that you are an inconvenience in doorways!" she answered,smiling as she passed him. Half an hour later she took leave, withPansy, and at the foot of the staircase the two ladies, with many otherdeparting guests, waited a while for their carriage. Just as itapproached Lord Warburton came out of the house and assisted them toreach their vehicle. He stood a moment at the door, asking Pansy if shehad amused herself; and she, having answered him, fell back with alittle air of fatigue. Then Isabel, at the window, detaining him by amovement of her finger, murmured gently: "Don't forget to send yourletter to her father!"</p></span><span id = 993 ><p>The Countess Gemini was often extremely bored--bored, in her ownphrase, to extinction. She had not been extinguished, however, and shestruggled bravely enough with her destiny, which had been to marry anunaccommodating Florentine who insisted upon living in his native town,where he enjoyed such consideration as might attach to a gentlemanwhose talent for losing at cards had not the merit of being incidentalto an obliging disposition. The Count Gemini was not liked even bythose who won from him; and he bore a name which, having a measurablevalue in Florence, was, like the local coin of the old Italian states,without currency in other parts of the peninsula. In Rome he was simplya very dull Florentine, and it is not remarkable that he should nothave cared to pay frequent visits to a place where, to carry it off,his dulness needed more explanation than was convenient. The Countesslived with her eyes upon Rome, and it was the constant grievance of herlife that she had not an habitation there. She was ashamed to say howseldom she had been allowed to visit that city; it scarcely made thematter better that there were other members of the Florentine nobilitywho never had been there at all. She went whenever she could; that wasall she could say. Or rather not all, but all she said she could say.In fact she had much more to say about it, and had often set forth thereasons why she hated Florence and wished to end her days in the shadowof Saint Peter's. They are reasons, however, that do not closelyconcern us, and were usually summed up in the declaration that Rome, inshort, was the Eternal City and that Florence was simply a prettylittle place like any other. The Countess apparently needed to connectthe idea of eternity with her amusements. She was convinced thatsociety was infinitely more interesting in Rome, where you metcelebrities all winter at evening parties. At Florence there were nocelebrities; none at least that one had heard of. Since her brother'smarriage her impatience had greatly increased; she was so sure his wifehad a more brilliant life than herself. She was not so intellectual asIsabel, but she was intellectual enough to do justice to Rome--not tothe ruins and the catacombs, not even perhaps to the monuments andmuseums, the church ceremonies and the scenery; but certainly to allthe rest. She heard a great deal about her sister-in-law and knewperfectly that Isabel was having a beautiful time. She had indeed seenit for herself on the only occasion on which she had enjoyed thehospitality of Palazzo Roccanera. She had spent a week there during thefirst winter of her brother's marriage, but she had not been encouragedto renew this satisfaction. Osmond didn't want her--that she wasperfectly aware of; but she would have gone all the same, for after allshe didn't care two straws about Osmond. It was her husband whowouldn't let her, and the money question was always a trouble. Isabelhad been very nice; the Countess, who had liked her sister-in-law fromthe first, had not been blinded by envy to Isabel's personal merits.She had always observed that she got on better with clever women thanwith silly ones like herself; the silly ones could never understand herwisdom, whereas the clever ones--the really clever ones--alwaysunderstood her silliness. It appeared to her that, different as theywere in appearance and general style, Isabel and she had somewhere apatch of common ground that they would set their feet upon at last. Itwas not very large, but it was firm, and they should both know it whenonce they had really touched it. And then she lived, with Mrs. Osmond,under the influence of a pleasant surprise; she was constantlyexpecting that Isabel would "look down" on her, and she as constantlysaw this operation postponed. She asked herself when it would begin,like fire-works, or Lent, or the opera season; not that she cared much,but she wondered what kept it in abeyance. Her sister-in-law regardedher with none but level glances and expressed for the poor Countess aslittle contempt as admiration. In reality Isabel would as soon havethought of despising her as of passing a moral judgement on agrasshopper. She was not indifferent to her husband's sister, however;she was rather a little afraid of her. She wondered at her; she thoughther very extraordinary. The Countess seemed to her to have no soul; shewas like a bright rare shell, with a polished surface and a remarkablypink lip, in which something would rattle when you shook it. Thisrattle was apparently the Countess's spiritual principle, a littleloose nut that tumbled about inside of her. She was too odd fordisdain, too anomalous for comparisons. Isabel would have invited heragain (there was no question of inviting the Count</span><span id = 994 ><p>I have already had reason to say that Isabel knew her husband to bedispleased by the continuance of Ralph's visit to Rome. That knowledgewas very present to her as she went to her cousin's hotel the day aftershe had invited Lord Warburton to give a tangible proof of hissincerity; and at this moment, as at others, she had a sufficientperception of the sources of Osmond's opposition. He wished her to haveno freedom of mind, and he knew perfectly well that Ralph was anapostle of freedom. It was just because he was this, Isabel said toherself, that it was a refreshment to go and see him. It will beperceived that she partook of this refreshment in spite of herhusband's aversion to it, that is partook of it, as she flatteredherself, discreetly. She had not as yet undertaken to act in directopposition to his wishes; he was her appointed and inscribed master;she gazed at moments with a sort of incredulous blankness at this fact.It weighed upon her imagination, however; constantly present to hermind were all the traditionary decencies and sanctities of marriage.The idea of violating them filled her with shame as well as with dread,for on giving herself away she had lost sight of this contingency inthe perfect belief that her husband's intentions were as generous asher own. She seemed to see, none the less, the rapid approach of theday when she should have to take back something she had solemnlybestown. Such a ceremony would be odious and monstrous; she tried toshut her eyes to it meanwhile. Osmond would do nothing to help it bybeginning first; he would put that burden upon her to the end. He hadnot yet formally forbidden her to call upon Ralph; but she felt surethat unless Ralph should very soon depart this prohibition would come.How could poor Ralph depart? The weather as yet made it impossible. Shecould perfectly understand her husband's wish for the event; shedidn't, to be just, see how he COULD like her to be with her cousin.Ralph never said a word against him, but Osmond's sore, mute protestwas none the less founded. If he should positively interpose, if heshould put forth his authority, she would have to decide, and thatwouldn't be easy. The prospect made her heart beat and her cheeks burn,as I say, in advance; there were moments when, in her wish to avoid anopen rupture, she found herself wishing Ralph would start even at arisk. And it was of no use that, when catching herself in this state ofmind, she called herself a feeble spirit, a coward. It was not that sheloved Ralph less, but that almost anything seemed preferable torepudiating the most serious act--the single sacred act--of her life.That appeared to make the whole future hideous. To break with Osmondonce would be to break for ever; any open acknowledgement ofirreconcilable needs would be an admission that their whole attempt hadproved a failure. For them there could be no condonement, nocompromise, no easy forgetfulness, no formal readjustment. They hadattempted only one thing, but that one thing was to have beenexquisite. Once they missed it nothing else would do; there was noconceivable substitute for that success. For the moment, Isabel went tothe Hotel de Paris as often as she thought well; the measure ofpropriety was in the canon of taste, and there couldn't have been abetter proof that morality was, so to speak, a matter of earnestappreciation. Isabel's application of that measure had beenparticularly free to-day, for in addition to the general truth that shecouldn't leave Ralph to die alone she had something important to ask ofhim. This indeed was Gilbert's business as well as her own.</p><p>She came very soon to what she wished to speak of. "I want you to answer me a question. It's about Lord Warburton."</p><p>"I think I guess your question," Ralph answered from his arm-chair,out of which his thin legs protruded at greater length than ever.</p><p>"Very possibly you guess it. Please then answer it."</p><p>"Oh, I don't say I can do that."</p><p>"You're intimate with him," she said; "you've a great deal of observation of him."</p><p>"Very true. But think how he must dissimulate!"</p><p>"Why should he dissimulate? That's not his nature."</p><p>"Ah, you must remember that the circumstances are peculiar," said Ralph with an air of private amusement.</p><p>"To a certain extent--yes. But is he really in love?"</p><p>"Very much, I think. I can make that out."</p><p>"Ah!" said Isabel with a certain dryness.</p><p>Ralph looked at her as if his mild hilarity had been touched with mystification. "You say that as if you were disappointed."</p><p>Isabel got up, slowly smoothing her gloves and eyeing them thoughtfully. "It's after all no business of mine."</p><p>"You're very philosophic," said her cousin. And then in a moment: "May I enquire what you're talking about?"</p><p>Isabel stared. "I thought you knew. Lord Warburton tells me hewants, of all things in the world, to marry Pansy. I've told you thatbefore, without eliciting a comment from you. You might risk one thismorning, I think. Is it your belief that he really cares for her?"</p><p>"Ah, for Pansy, no!" cried Ralph very positively.</p><p>"But you said just now he did."</p><p>Ralph waited a moment. "That he cared for you, Mrs. Osmond."</p><p>Isabel shook her head gravely. "That's nonsense, you know."</p><p>"Of course it is. But the nonsense is Warburton's, not mine."</p><p>"That would be very tiresome." She spoke, as she flattered herself, with much subtlety.</p><p>"I ought to tell you indeed," Ralph went on, "that to me he has denied it."</p><p>"It's very good of you to talk about it together! Has he also told you that he's in love with Pansy?"</p><p>"He has spoken very well of her--very properly. He has let me know,of course, that he thinks she would do very well at Lockleigh."</p><p>"Does he really think it?"</p><p>"Ah, what Warburton really thinks--!" said Ralph.</p><p>Isabel fell to smoothing her gloves again; they were long, loosegloves on which she could freely expend herself. Soon, however, shelooked up, and then, "Ah, Ralph, you give me no help!" she criedabruptly and passionately.</p><p>It was the first time she had alluded to the need for help, and thewords shook her cousin with their violence. He gave a long murmur ofrelief, of pity, of tenderness; it seemed to him that at last the gulfbetween them had been bridged. It was this that made him exclaim in amoment: "How unhappy you must be!"</p><p>He had no sooner spoken than she recovered her self-possession, andthe first use she made of it was to pretend she had not heard him."When I talk of your helping me I talk great nonsense," she said with aquick smile. "The idea of my troubling you with my domesticembarrassments! The matter's very simple; Lord Warburton must get on byhimself. I can't undertake to see him through."</p><p>"He ought to succeed easily," said Ralph.</p><p>Isabel debated. "Yes--but he has not always succeeded."</p><p>"Very true. You know, however, how that always surprised me. Is Miss Osmond capable of giving us a surprise?"</p><p>"It will come from him, rather. I seem to see that after all he'll let the matter drop."</p><p>"He'll do nothing dishonourable," said Ralph.</p><p>"I'm very sure of that. Nothing can be more honourable than for himto leave the poor child alone. She cares for another person, and it'scruel to attempt to bribe her by magnificent offers to give him up."</p><p>"Cruel to the other person perhaps--the one she cares for. But Warburton isn't obliged to mind that."</p><p>"No, cruel to her," said Isabel. "She would be very unhappy if shewere to allow herself to be persuaded to desert poor Mr. Rosier. Thatidea seems to amuse you; of course you're not in love with him. He hasthe merit--for Pansy--of being in love with Pansy. She can see at aglance that Lord Warburton isn't."</p><p>"He'd be very good to her," said Ralph.</p><p>"He has been good to her already. Fortunately, however, he has notsaid a word to disturb her. He could come and bid her good-byeto-morrow with perfect propriety."</p><p>"How would your husband like that?"</p><p>"Not at all; and he may be right in not liking it. Only he must obtain satisfaction himself."</p><p>"Has he commissioned you to obtain it?" Ralph ventured to ask.</p><p>"It was natural that as an old friend of Lord Warburton's--an olderfriend, that is, than Gilbert--I should take an interest in hisintentions."</p><p>"Take an interest in his renouncing them, you mean?"</p><p>Isabel hesitated, frowning a little. "Let me understand. Are you pleading his cause?"</p><p>"Not in the least. I'm very glad he shouldn't become yourstepdaughter's husband. It makes such a very queer relation to you!"said Ralph, smiling. "But I'm rather nervous lest your husband shouldthink you haven't pushed him enough."</p><p>Isabel found herself able to smile as well as he. "He knows me wellenough not to have expected me to push. He himself has no intention ofpushing, I presume. I'm not afraid I shall not be able to justifymyself!" she said lightly.</p><p>Her mask had dropped for an instant, but she had put it on again, toRalph's infinite disappointment. He had caught a glimpse of her naturalface and he wished immensely to look into it. He had an almost savagedesire to hear her complain of her husband--hear her say that sheshould be held accountable for Lord Warburton's defection. Ralph wascertain that this was her situation; he knew by instinct, in advance,the form that in such an event Osmond's displeasure would take. Itcould only take the meanest and cruellest. He would have liked to warnIsabel of it--to let her see at least how he judged for her and how heknew. It little mattered that Isabel would know much better; it was forhis own satisfaction more than for hers that he longed to show her hewas not deceived. He tried and tried again to make her betray Osmond;he felt cold-blooded, cruel, dishonourable almost, in doing so. But itscarcely mattered, for be only failed. What had she come for then, andwhy did she seem almost to offer him a chance to violate their tacitconvention? Why did she ask him his advice if she gave him no libertyto answer her? How could they talk of her domestic embarrassments, asit pleased her humorously to designate them, if the principal factorwas not to be mentioned? These contradictions were themselves but anindication of her trouble, and her cry for help, just before, was theonly thing he was bound to consider. "You'll be decidedly at variance,all the same," he said in a moment. And as she answered nothing,looking as if she scarce understood, "You'll find yourselves thinkingvery differently," he continued.</p><p>"That may easily happen, among the most united couples!" She took upher parasol; he saw she was nervous, afraid of what he might say. "It'sa matter we can hardly quarrel about, however," she added; "for almostall the interest is on his side. That's very natural. Pansy's after allhis daughter--not mine." And she put out her hand to wish him goodbye.</p><p>Ralph took an inward resolution that she shouldn't leave him withouthis letting her know that he knew everything: it seemed too great anopportunity to lose. "Do you know what his interest will make him say?"he asked as he took her hand. She shook her head, rather dryly--notdiscouragingly--and he went on. "It will make him say that your want ofzeal is owing to jealousy." He stopped a moment; her face made himafraid.</p><p>"To jealousy?"</p><p>"To jealousy of his daughter."</p><p>She blushed red and threw back her head. "You're not kind," she said in a voice that he had never heard on her lips.</p><p>"Be frank with me and you'll see," he answered.</p><p>But she made no reply; she only pulled her hand out of his own,which he tried still to hold, and rapidly withdrew from the room. Shemade up her mind to speak to Pansy, and she took an occasion on thesame day, going to the girl's room before dinner. Pansy was alreadydressed; she was always in advance of the time: it seemed to illustrateher pretty patience and the graceful stillness with which she could sitand wait. At present she was seated, in her fresh array, before thebed-room fire; she had blown out her candles on the completion of hertoilet, in accordance with the economical habits in which she had beenbrought up sand which she was now more careful than ever to observe; sothat the room was lighted only by a couple of logs. The rooms inPalazzo Roccanera were as spacious as they were numerous, and Pansy'svirginal bower was an immense chamber with a dark, heavily-timberedceiling. Its diminutive mistress, in the midst of it, appeared but aspeck of humanity, and as she got up, with quick deference, to welcomeIsabel, the latter was more than ever struck with her shy sincerity.Isabel had a difficult task--the only thing was to perform it as simplyas possible. She felt bitter and angry, but she warned herself againstbetraying this heat. She was afraid even of looking too grave, or atleast too stern; she was afraid of causing alarm. Put Pansy seemed tohave guessed she had come more or less as a confessor; for after shehad moved the chair in which she had been sitting a little nearer tothe fire and Isabel had taken her place in it, she kneeled down on acushion in front of her, looking up and resting her clasped hands onher stepmother's knees. What Isabel wished to do was to hear from herown lips that her mind was not occupied with Lord Warburton; but if shedesired the assurance she felt herself by no means at liberty toprovoke it. The girl's father would have qualified this as ranktreachery; and indeed Isabel knew that if Pansy should display thesmallest germ of a disposition to encourage Lord Warburton her own dutywas to hold her tongue. It was difficult to interrogate withoutappearing to suggest; Pansy's supreme simplicity, an innocence evenmore complete than Isabel had yet judged it, gave to the most tentativeenquiry something of the effect of an admonition. As she knelt there inthe vague firelight, with her pretty dress dimly shining, her handsfolded half in appeal and half in submission, her soft eyes, raised andfixed, full of the seriousness of the situation, she looked to Isabellike a childish martyr decked out for sacrifice and scarcely presumingeven to hope to avert it. When Isabel said to her that she had neveryet spoken to her of what might have been going on in relation to hergetting married, but that her silence had not been indifference orignorance, had only been the desire to leave her at liberty, Pansy bentforward, raised her face nearer and nearer, and with a little murmurwhich evidently expressed a deep longing, answered that she had greatlywished her to speak and that she begged her to advise her now.</p><p>"It's difficult for me to advise you," Isabel returned. "I don'tknow how I can undertake that. That's for your father; you must get hisadvice and, above all, you must act on it."</p><p>At this Pansy dropped her eyes; for a moment she said nothing. "Ithink I should like your advice better than papa's," she presentlyremarked.</p><p>"That's not as it should be," said Isabel coldly. "I love you very much, but your father loves you better."</p><p>"It isn't because you love me--it's because you're a lady," Pansyanswered with the air of saying something very reasonable. "A lady canadvise a young girl better than a man."</p><p>"I advise you then to pay the greatest respect to your father's wishes."</p><p>"Ah yes," said the child eagerly, "I must do that."</p><p>"But if I speak to you now about your getting married it's not foryour own sake, it's for mine," Isabel went on. "If I try to learn fromyou what you expect, what you desire, it's only that I may actaccordingly."</p><p>Pansy stared, and then very quickly, "Will you do everything I want?" she asked.</p><p>"Before I say yes I must know what such things are."</p><p>Pansy presently told her that the only thing she wanted in life wasto marry Mr. Rosier. He had asked her and she had told him she would doso if her papa would allow it. Now her papa wouldn't allow it.</p><p>"Very well then, it's impossible," Isabel pronounced.</p><p>"Yes, it's impossible," said Pansy without a sigh and with the same extreme attention in her clear little face.</p><p>"You must think of something else then," Isabel went on; but Pansy,sighing at this, told her that she had attempted that feat without theleast success.</p><p>"You think of those who think of you," she said with a faint smile. "I know Mr. Rosier thinks of me."</p><p>"He ought not to," said Isabel loftily. "Your father has expressly requested he shouldn't."</p><p>"He can't help it, because he knows I think of HIM."</p><p>"You shouldn't think of him. There's some excuse for him, perhaps; but there's none for you."</p><p>"I wish you would try to find one," the girl exclaimed as if she were praying to the Madonna.</p><p>"I should be very sorry to attempt it," said the Madonna withunusual frigidity. "If you knew some one else was thinking of you,would you think of him?"</p><p>"No one can think of me as Mr. Rosier does; no one has the right."</p><p>"Ah, but I don't admit Mr. Rosier's right!" Isabel hypocritically cried.</p><p>Pansy only gazed at her, evidently much puzzled; and Isabel, takingadvantage of it, began to represent to her the wretched consequences ofdisobeying her father. At this Pansy stopped her with the assurancethat she would never disobey him, would never marry without hisconsent. And she announced, in the serenest, simplest tone, that,though she might never marry Mr. Rosier, she would never cease to thinkof him. She appeared to have accepted the idea of eternal singleness;but Isabel of course was free to reflect that she had no conception ofits meaning. She was perfectly sincere; she was prepared to give up herlover. This might seem an important step toward taking another, but forPansy, evidently, it failed to lead in that direction. She felt nobitterness toward her father; there was no bitterness in her heart;there was only the sweetness of fidelity to Edward Rosier, and astrange, exquisite intimation that she could prove it better byremaining single than even by marrying him.</p><p>"Your father would like you to make a better marriage," said Isabel. "Mr. Rosier's fortune is not at all large."</p><p>"How do you mean better--if that would be good enough? And I have myself so little money; why should I look for a fortune?"</p><p>"Your having so little is a reason for looking for more." With whichIsabel was grateful for the dimness of the room; she felt as if herface were hideously insincere. It was what she was doing for Osmond; itwas what one had to do for Osmond! Pansy's solemn eyes, fixed on herown, almost embarrassed her; she was ashamed to think she had made solight of the girl's preference.</p><p>"What should you like me to do?" her companion softly demanded.</p><p>The question was a terrible one, and Isabel took refuge in timorousvagueness. "To remember all the pleasure it's in your power to giveyour father."</p><p>"To marry some one else, you mean--if he should ask me?"</p><p>For a moment Isabel's answer caused itself to be waited for; thenshe heard herself utter it in the stillness that Pansy's attentionseemed to make. "Yes--to marry some one else."</p><p>The child's eyes grew more penetrating; Isabel believed she wasdoubting her sincerity, and the impression took force from her slowlygetting up from her cushion. She stood there a moment with her smallhands unclasped and then quavered out: "Well, I hope no one will askme!"</p><p>"There has been a question of that. Some one else would have been ready to ask you."</p><p>"I don't think he can have been ready," said Pansy.</p><p>"It would appear so if he had been sure he'd succeed."</p><p>"If he had been sure? Then he wasn't ready!"</p><p>Isabel thought this rather sharp; she also got up and stood a momentlooking into the fire. "Lord Warburton has shown you great attention,"she resumed; "of course you know it's of him I speak." She foundherself, against her expectation, almost placed in the position ofjustifying herself; which led her to introduce this nobleman morecrudely than she had intended.</p><p>"He has been very kind to me, and I like him very much. But if you mean that he'll propose for me I think you're mistaken."</p><p>"Perhaps I am. But your father would like it extremely."</p><p>Pansy shook her head with a little wise smile. "Lord Warburton won't propose simply to please papa."</p><p>"Your father would like you to encourage him," Isabel went on mechanically.</p><p>"How can I encourage him?"</p><p>"I don't know. Your father must tell you that."</p><p>Pansy said nothing for a moment; she only continued to smile as ifshe were in possession of a bright assurance. "There's no danger--nodanger!" she declared at last.</p><p>There was a conviction in the way she said this, and a felicity inher believing it, which conduced to Isabel's awkwardness. She feltaccused of dishonesty, and the idea was disgusting. To repair herself-respect she was on the point of saying that Lord Warburton had lether know that there was a danger. But she didn't; she only said--in herembarrassment rather wide of the mark--that he surely had been mostkind, most friendly.</p><p>"Yes, he has been very kind," Pansy answered. "That's what I like him for."</p><p>"Why then is the difficulty so great?"</p><p>"I've always felt sure of his knowing that I don't want--what didyou say I should do?--to encourage him. He knows I don't want to marry,and he wants me to know that he therefore won't trouble me. That's themeaning of his kindness. It's as if he said to me: 'I like you verymuch, but if it doesn't please you I'll never say it again.' I thinkthat's very kind, very noble," Pansy went on with deepeningpositiveness. "That is all we've said to each other. And he doesn'tcare for me either. Ah no, there's no danger."</p><p>Isabel was touched with wonder at the depths of perception of whichthis submissive little person was capable; she felt afraid of Pansy'swisdom--began almost to retreat before it. "You must tell your fatherthat," she remarked reservedly.</p><p>"I think I'd rather not," Pansy unreservedly answered.</p><p>"You oughtn't to let him have false hopes."</p><p>"Perhaps not; but it will be good for me that he should. So long ashe believes that Lord Warburton intends anything of the kind you say,papa won't propose any one else. And that will be an advantage for me,"said the child very lucidly.</p><p>There was something brilliant in her lucidity, and it made hercompanion draw a long breath. It relieved this friend of a heavyresponsibility. Pansy had a sufficient illumination of her own, andIsabel felt that she herself just now had no light to spare from hersmall stock. Nevertheless it still clung to her that she must be loyalto Osmond, that she was on her honour in dealing with his daughter.Under the influence of this sentiment she threw out another suggestionbefore she retired--a suggestion with which it seemed to her that sheshould have done her utmost.</p><p>"Your father takes for granted at least that you would like to marry a nobleman."</p><p>Pansy stood in the open doorway; she had drawn back the curtain forIsabel to pass. "I think Mr. Rosier looks like one!" she remarked verygravely.</p></span><span id = 995 ><p>Lord Warburton was not seen in Mrs. Osmond's drawing-room forseveral days, and Isabel couldn't fail to observe that her husband saidnothing to her about having received a letter from him. She couldn'tfail to observe, either, that Osmond was in a state of expectancy andthat, though it was not agreeable to him to betray it, he thought theirdistinguished friend kept him waiting quite too long. At the end offour days he alluded to his absence.</p><p>"What has become of Warburton? What does he mean by treating one like a tradesman with a bill?"</p><p>"I know nothing about him," Isabel said. "I saw him last Friday atthe German ball. He told me then that he meant to write to you."</p><p>"He has never written to me."</p><p>"So I supposed, from your not having told me."</p><p>"He's an odd fish," said Osmond comprehensively. And on Isabel'smaking no rejoinder he went on to enquire whether it took his lordshipfive days to indite a letter. "Does he form his words with suchdifficulty?"</p><p>"I don't know," Isabel was reduced to replying. "I've never had a letter from him."</p><p>"Never had a letter? I had an idea that you were at one time in intimate correspondence."</p><p>She answered that this had not been the case, and let theconversation drop. On the morrow, however, coming into the drawing-roomlate in the afternoon, her husband took it up again.</p><p>"When Lord Warburton told you of his intention of writing what did you say to him?" he asked.</p><p>She just faltered. "I think I told him not to forget it.</p><p>"Did you believe there was a danger of that?"</p><p>"As you say, he's an odd fish."</p><p>"Apparently he has forgotten it," said Osmond. "Be so good as to remind him."</p><p>"Should you like me to write to him?" she demanded.</p><p>"I've no objection whatever."</p><p>"You expect too much of me."</p><p>"Ah yes, I expect a great deal of you."</p><p>"I'm afraid I shall disappoint you," said Isabel.</p><p>"My expectations have survived a good deal of disappointment."</p><p>"Of course I know that. Think how I must have disappointed myself!If you really wish hands laid on Lord Warburton you must lay themyourself."</p><p>For a couple of minutes Osmond answered nothing; then he said: "That won't be easy, with you working against me."</p><p>Isabel started; she felt herself beginning to tremble. He had a wayof looking at her through half-closed eyelids, as if he were thinkingof her but scarcely saw her, which seemed to her to have a wonderfullycruel intention. It appeared to recognise her as a disagreeablenecessity of thought, but to ignore her for the time as a presence.That effect had never been so marked as now. "I think you accuse me ofsomething very base," she returned.</p><p>"I accuse you of not being trustworthy. If he doesn't after all comeforward it will be because you've kept him off. I don't know that it'sbase: it is the kind of thing a woman always thinks she may do. I've nodoubt you've the finest ideas about it."</p><p>"I told you I would do what I could," she went on.</p><p>"Yes, that gained you time."</p><p>It came over her, after he had said this, that she had once thoughthim beautiful. "How much you must want to make sure of him!" sheexclaimed in a moment.</p><p>She had no sooner spoken than she perceived the full reach of herwords, of which she had not been conscious in uttering them. They madea comparison between Osmond and herself, recalled the fact that she hadonce held this coveted treasure in her hand and felt herself richenough to let it fall. A momentary exultation took possession of her--ahorrible delight in having wounded him; for his face instantly told herthat none of the force of her exclamation was lost. He expressednothing otherwise, however; he only said quickly: "Yes, I want itimmensely."</p><p>At this moment a servant came in to usher a visitor, and he wasfollowed the next by Lord Warburton, who received a visible check onseeing Osmond. He looked rapidly from the master of the house to themistress; a movement that seemed to denote a reluctance to interrupt oreven a perception of ominous conditions. Then he advanced, with hisEnglish address, in which a vague shyness seemed to offer itself as anelement of good-breeding; in which the only defect was a difficulty inachieving transitions. Osmond was embarrassed; he found nothing to say;but Isabel remarked, promptly enough, that they had been in the act oftalking about their visitor. Upon this her husband added that theyhadn't known what was become of him--they had been afraid he had goneaway. "No," he explained, smiling and looking at Osmond; "I'm only onthe point of going." And then he mentioned that he found himselfsuddenly recalled to England: he should start on the morrow or the dayafter. "I'm awfully sorry to leave poor Touchett!" he ended byexclaiming.</p><p>For a moment neither of his companions spoke; Osmond only leanedback in his chair, listening. Isabel didn't look at him; she could onlyfancy how he looked. Her eyes were on their visitor's face, where theywere the more free to rest that those of his lordship carefully avoidedthem. Yet Isabel was sure that had she met his glance she would havefound it expressive. "You had better take poor Touchett with you," sheheard her husband say, lightly enough, in a moment.</p><p>"He had better wait for warmer weather," Lord Warburton answered. "I shouldn't advise him to travel just now."</p><p>He sat there a quarter of an hour, talking as if he might not soonsee them again--unless indeed they should come to England, a course hestrongly recommended. Why shouldn't they come to England in theautumn?--that struck him as a very happy thought. It would give himsuch pleasure to do what he could for them--to have them come and spenda month with him. Osmond, by his own admission, had been to England butonce; which was an absurd state of things for a man of his leisure andintelligence. It was just the country for him--he would be sure to geton well there. Then Lord Warburton asked Isabel if she remembered whata good time she had had there and if she didn't want to try it again.Didn't she want to see Gardencourt once more? Gardencourt was reallyvery good. Touchett didn't take proper care of it, but it was the sortof place you could hardly spoil by letting it alone. Why didn't theycome and pay Touchett a visit? He surely must have asked them. Hadn'tasked them? What an ill-mannered wretch! --and Lord Warburton promisedto give the master of Gardencourt a piece of his mind. Of course it wasa mere accident; he would be delighted to have them. Spending a monthwith Touchett and a month with himself, and seeing all the rest of thepeople they must know there, they really wouldn't find it half bad.Lord Warburton added that it would amuse Miss Osmond as well, who hadtold him that she had never been to England and whom he had assured itwas a country she deserved to see. Of course she didn't need to go toEngland to be admired--that was her fate everywhere; but she would bean immense success there, she certainly would, if that was anyinducement. He asked if she were not at home: couldn't he say good-bye?Not that he liked good-byes--he always funked them. When he leftEngland the other day he hadn't said good-bye to a two-legged creature.He had had half a mind to leave Rome without troubling Mrs. Osmond fora final interview. What could be more dreary than final interviews? Onenever said the things one wanted--one remembered them all an hourafterwards. On the other hand one usually said a lot of things oneshouldn't, simply from a sense that one had to say something. Such asense was upsetting; it muddled one's wits. He had it at present, andthat was the effect it produced on him. If Mrs. Osmond didn't think hespoke as he ought she must set it down to agitation; it was no lightthing to part with Mrs. Osmond. He was really very sorry to be going.He had thought of writing to her instead of calling--but he would writeto her at any rate, to tell her a lot of things that would be sure tooccur to him as soon as he had left the house. They must thinkseriously about coming to Lockleigh.</p><p>If there was anything awkward in the conditions of his visit or inthe announcement of his departure it failed to come to the surface.Lord Warburton talked about his agitation; but he showed it in no othermanner, and Isabel saw that since he had determined on a retreat he wascapable of executing it gallantly. She was very glad for him; she likedhim quite well enough to wish him to appear to carry a thing off. Hewould do that on any occasion--not from impudence but simply from thehabit of success; and Isabel felt it out of her husband's power tofrustrate this faculty. A complex operation, as she sat there, went onin her mind. On one side she listened to their visitor; said what wasproper to him; read, more or less, between the lines of what he saidhimself; and wondered how he would have spoken if he had found heralone. On the other she had a perfect consciousness of Osmond'semotion. She felt almost sorry for him; he was condemned to the sharppain of loss without the relief of cursing. He had had a great hope,and now, as he saw it vanish into smoke, he was obliged to sit andsmile and twirl his thumbs. Not that he troubled himself to smile verybrightly; he treated their friend on the whole to as vacant acountenance as so clever a man could very well wear. It was indeed apart of Osmond's cleverness that he could look consummatelyuncompromised. His present appearance, however, was not a confession ofdisappointment; it was simply a part of Osmond's habitual system, whichwas to be inexpressive exactly in proportion as he was really intent.He had been intent on this prize from the first; but he had neverallowed his eagerness to irradiate his refined face. He had treated hispossible son-in-law as he treated every one--with an air of beinginterested in him only for his own advantage, not for any profit to aperson already so generally, so perfectly provided as Gilbert Osmond.He would give no sign now of an inward rage which was the result of avanished prospect of gain--not the faintest nor subtlest. Isabel couldbe sure of that, if it was any satisfaction to her. Strangely, verystrangely, it was a satisfaction; she wished Lord Warburton to triumphbefore her husband, and at the same time she wished her husband to bevery superior before Lord Warburton. Osmond, in his way, was admirable;he had, like their visitor, the advantage of an acquired habit. It wasnot that of succeeding, but it was something almost as good--that ofnot attempting. As he leaned back in his place, listening but vaguelyto the other's friendly offers and suppressed explanations--as if itwere only proper to assume that they were addressed essentially to hiswife--he had at least (since so little else was left him) the comfortof thinking how well he personally had kept out of it, and how the airof indifference, which he was now able to wear, had the added beauty ofconsistency. It was something to be able to look as if theleave-taker's movements had no relation to his own mind. The latter didwell, certainly; but Osmond's performance was in its very nature morefinished. Lord Warburton's position was after all an easy one; therewas no reason in the world why he shouldn't leave Rome. He had hadbeneficent inclinations, but they had stopped short of fruition; he hadnever committed himself, and his honour was safe. Osmond appeared totake but a moderate interest in the proposal that they should go andstay with him and in his allusion to the success Pansy might extractfrom their visit. He murmured a recognition, but left Isabel to saythat it was a matter requiring grave consideration. Isabel, even whileshe made this remark, could see the great vista which had suddenlyopened out in her husband's mind, with Pansy's little figure marchingup the middle of it.</p><p>Lord Warburton had asked leave to bid good-bye to Pansy, but neitherIsabel nor Osmond had made any motion to send for her. He had the airof giving out that his visit must be short; he sat on a small chair, asif it were only for a moment, keeping his hat in his hand. But hestayed and stayed; Isabel wondered what he was waiting for. Shebelieved it was not to see Pansy; she had an impression that on thewhole he would rather not see Pansy. It was of course to see herselfalone--he had something to say to her. Isabel had no great wish to hearit, for she was afraid it would be an explanation, and she couldperfectly dispense with explanations. Osmond, however, presently gotup, like a man of good taste to whom it had occurred that so inveteratea visitor might wish to say just the last word of all to the ladies."I've a letter to write before dinner," he said; "you must excuse me.I'll see if my daughter's disengaged, and if she is she shall knowyou're here. Of course when you come to Rome you'll always look us up.Mrs. Osmond will talk to you about the English expedition: she decidesall those things."</p><p>The nod with which, instead of a hand-shake, he wound up this littlespeech was perhaps rather a meagre form of salutation; but on the wholeit was all the occasion demanded. Isabel reflected that after he leftthe room Lord Warburton would have no pretext for saying, "Yourhusband's very angry"; which would have been extremely disagreeable toher. Nevertheless, if he had done so, she would have said: "Oh, don'tbe anxious. He doesn't hate you: it's me that he hates!"</p><p>It was only when they had been left alone together that her friendshowed a certain vague awkwardness--sitting down in another chair,handling two or three of the objects that were near him. "I hope he'llmake Miss Osmond come," he presently remarked. "I want very much to seeher."</p><p>"I'm glad it's the last time," said Isabel.</p><p>"So am I. She doesn't care for me."</p><p>"No, she doesn't care for you."</p><p>"I don't wonder at it," he returned. Then he added with inconsequence: "You'll come to England, won't you?"</p><p>"I think we had better not."</p><p>"Ah, you owe me a visit. Don't you remember that you were to have come to Lockleigh once, and you never did?"</p><p>"Everything's changed since then," said Isabel.</p><p>"Not changed for the worse, surely--as far as we're concerned. Tosee you under my roof"--and he hung fire but an instant--"would be agreat satisfaction."</p><p>She had feared an explanation; but that was the only one thatoccurred. They talked a little of Ralph, and in another moment Pansycame in, already dressed for dinner and with a little red spot ineither cheek. She shook hands with Lord Warburton and stood looking upinto his face with a fixed smile--a smile that Isabel knew, though hislordship probably never suspected it, to be near akin to a burst oftears.</p><p>"I'm going away," he said. "I want to bid you good-bye."</p><p>"Good-bye, Lord Warburton." Her voice perceptibly trembled.</p><p>"And I want to tell you how much I wish you may be very happy."</p><p>"Thank you, Lord Warburton," Pansy answered.</p><p>He lingered a moment and gave a glance at Isabel. "You ought to be very happy--you've got a guardian angel."</p><p>"I'm sure I shall be happy," said Pansy in the tone of a person whose certainties were always cheerful.</p><p>"Such a conviction as that will take you a great way. But if itshould ever fail you, remember--remember--" And her interlocutorstammered a little. "Think of me sometimes, you know!" he said with avague laugh. Then he shook hands with Isabel in silence, and presentlyhe was gone.</p><p>When he had left the room she expected an effusion of tears from herstepdaughter; but Pansy in fact treated her to something very different.</p><p>"I think you ARE my guardian angel!" she exclaimed very sweetly.</p><p>Isabel shook her head. "I'm not an angel of any kind. I'm at the most your good friend."</p><p>"You're a very good friend then--to have asked papa to be gentle with me."</p><p>"I've asked your father nothing," said Isabel, wondering.</p><p>"He told me just now to come to the drawing-room, and then he gave me a very kind kiss."</p><p>"Ah," said Isabel, "that was quite his own idea!"</p><p>She recognised the idea perfectly; it was very characteristic, andshe was to see a great deal more of it. Even with Pansy he couldn't puthimself the least in the wrong. They were dining out that day, andafter their dinner they went to another entertainment; so that it wasnot till late in the evening that Isabel saw him alone. When Pansykissed him before going to bed he returned her embrace with even morethan his usual munificence, and Isabel wondered if he meant it as ahint that his daughter had been injured by the machinations of herstepmother. It was a partial expression, at any rate, of what hecontinued to expect of his wife. She was about to follow Pansy, but heremarked that he wished she would remain; he had something to say toher. Then he walked about the drawing-room a little, while she stoodwaiting in her cloak.</p><p>"I don't understand what you wish to do," he said in a moment. "I should like to know--so that I may know how to act."</p><p>"Just now I wish to go to bed. I'm very tired."</p><p>"Sit down and rest; I shall not keep you long. Not there--take acomfortable place." And he arranged a multitude of cushions that werescattered in picturesque disorder upon a vast divan. This was not,however, where she seated herself; she dropped into the nearest chair.The fire had gone out; the lights in the great room were few. She drewher cloak about her; she felt mortally cold. "I think you're trying tohumiliate me," Osmond went on. "It's a most absurd undertaking."</p><p>"I haven't the least idea what you mean," she returned.</p><p>"You've played a very deep game; you've managed it beautifully."</p><p>"What is it that I've managed?"</p><p>"You've not quite settled it, however; we shall see him again." Andhe stopped in front of her, with his hands in his pockets, looking downat her thoughtfully, in his usual way, which seemed meant to let herknow that she was not an object, but only a rather disagreeableincident, of thought.</p><p>"If you mean that Lord Warburton's under an obligation to come back you're wrong," Isabel said. "He's under none whatever."</p><p>"That's just what I complain of. But when I say he'll come back I don't mean he'll come from a sense of duty."</p><p>"There's nothing else to make him. I think he has quite exhausted Rome."</p><p>"Ah no, that's a shallow judgement. Rome's inexhaustible." AndOsmond began to walk about again. "However, about that perhaps there'sno hurry," he added. "It's rather a good idea of his that we should goto England. If it were not for the fear of finding your cousin there Ithink I should try to persuade you."</p><p>"It may be that you'll not find my cousin," said Isabel.</p><p>"I should like to be sure of it. However, I shall be as sure aspossible. At the same time I should like to see his house, that youtold me so much about at one time: what do you call it?-- Gardencourt.It must be a charming thing. And then, you know, I've a devotion to thememory of your uncle: you made me take a great fancy to him. I shouldlike to see where he lived and died. That indeed is a detail. Yourfriend was right. Pansy ought to see England."</p><p>"I've no doubt she would enjoy it," said Isabel.</p><p>"But that's a long time hence; next autumn's far off," Osmondcontinued; "and meantime there are things that more nearly interest us.Do you think me so very proud?" he suddenly asked.</p><p>"I think you very strange."</p><p>"You don't understand me."</p><p>"No, not even when you insult me."</p><p>"I don't insult you; I'm incapable of it. I merely speak of certainfacts, and if the allusion's an injury to you the fault's not mine.It's surely a fact that you have kept all this matter quite in your ownhands."</p><p>"Are you going back to Lord Warburton?" Isabel asked. "I'm very tired of his name."</p><p>"You shall hear it again before we've done with it."</p><p>She had spoken of his insulting her, but it suddenly seemed to herthat this ceased to be a pain. He was going down--down; the vision ofsuch a fall made her almost giddy: that was the only pain. He was toostrange, too different; he didn't touch her. Still, the working of hismorbid passion was extraordinary, and she felt a rising curiosity toknow in what light he saw himself justified. "I might say to you that Ijudge you've nothing to say to me that's worth hearing," she returnedin a moment. "But I should perhaps be wrong. There's a thing that wouldbe worth my hearing--to know in the plainest words of what it is youaccuse me."</p><p>"Of having prevented Pansy's marriage to Warburton. Are those words plain enough?"</p><p>"On the contrary, I took a great interest in it. I told you so; andwhen you told me that you counted on me--that I think was what yousaid--I accepted the obligation. I was a fool to do so, but I did it."</p><p>"You pretended to do it, and you even pretended reluctance to makeme more willing to trust you. Then you began to use your ingenuity toget him out of the way."</p><p>"I think I see what you mean," said Isabel.</p><p>"Where's the letter you told me he had written me?" her husband demanded.</p><p>"I haven't the least idea; I haven't asked him."</p><p>"You stopped it on the way," said Osmond.</p><p>Isabel slowly got up; standing there in her white cloak, whichcovered her to her feet, she might have represented the angel ofdisdain, first cousin to that of pity. "Oh, Gilbert, for a man who wasso fine--!" she exclaimed in a long murmur.</p><p>"I was never so fine as you. You've done everything you wanted.You've got him out of the say without appearing to do so, and you'veplaced me in the position in which you wished to see me-- that of a manwho has tried to marry his daughter to a lord, but has grotesquelyfailed."</p><p>"Pansy doesn't care for him. She's very glad he's gone," Isabel said.</p><p>"That has nothing to do with the matter."</p><p>"And he doesn't care for Pansy."</p><p>"That won't do; you told me he did. I don't know why you wanted thisparticular satisfaction," Osmond continued; "you might have taken someother. It doesn't seem to me that I've been presumptuous--that I havetaken too much for granted. I've been very modest about it, very quiet.The idea didn't originate with me. He began to show that he liked herbefore I ever thought of it. I left it all to you."</p><p>"Yes, you were very glad to leave it to me. After this you must attend to such things yourself."</p><p>He looked at her a moment; then he turned away. "I thought you were very fond of my daughter."</p><p>"I've never been more so than to-day."</p><p>"Your affection is attended with immense limitations. However, that perhaps is natural."</p><p>"Is this all you wished to say to me?" Isabel asked, taking a candle that stood on one of the tables.</p><p>"Are you satisfied? Am I sufficiently disappointed?"</p><p>"I don't think that on the whole you're disappointed. You've had another opportunity to try to stupefy me."</p><p>"It's not that. It's proved that Pansy can aim high."</p><p>"Poor little Pansy!" said Isabel as she turned away with her candle.</p></span><span id = 996 ><p>It was from Henrietta Stackpole that she learned how Caspar Goodwoodhad come to Rome; an event that took place three days after LordWarburton's departure. This latter fact had been preceded by anincident of some importance to Isabel--the temporary absence, onceagain, of Madame Merle, who had gone to Naples to stay with a friend,the happy possessor of a villa at Posilippo. Madame Merle had ceased tominister to Isabel's happiness, who found herself wondering whether themost discreet of women might not also by chance be the most dangerous.Sometimes, at night, she had strange visions; she seemed to see herhusband and her friend--his friend--in dim, indistinguishablecombination. It seemed to her that she had not done with her; this ladyhad something in reserve. Isabel's imagination applied itself activelyto this elusive point, but every now and then it was checked by anameless dread, so that when the charming woman was away from Rome shehad almost a consciousness of respite. She had already learned fromMiss Stackpole that Caspar Goodwood was in Europe, Henrietta havingwritten to make it known to her immediately after meeting him in Paris.He himself never wrote to Isabel, and though he was in Europe shethought it very possible he might not desire to see her. Their lastinterview, before her marriage, had had quite the character of acomplete rupture; if she remembered rightly he had said he wished totake his last look at her. Since then he had been the most discordantsurvival of her earlier time--the only one in fact with which apermanent pain was associated. He had left her that morning with asense of the most superfluous of shocks: it was like a collisionbetween vessels in broad daylight. There had been no mist, no hiddencurrent to excuse it, and she herself had only wished to steer wide. Hehad bumped against her prow, however, while her hand was on the tiller,and--to complete the metaphor--had given the lighter vessel a strainwhich still occasionally betrayed itself in a faint creaking. It hadbeen horrid to see him, because he represented the only serious harmthat (to her belief) she had ever done in the world: he was the onlyperson with an unsatisfied claim on her. She had made him unhappy, shecouldn't help it; and his unhappiness was a grim reality. She had criedwith rage, after he had left her, at--she hardly knew what: she triedto think it had been at his want of consideration. He had come to herwith his unhappiness when her own bliss was so perfect; he had done hisbest to darken the brightness of those pure rays. He had not beenviolent, and yet there had been a violence in the impression. There hadbeen a violence at any rate in something somewhere; perhaps it was onlyin her own fit of weeping and in that after-sense of the same which hadlasted three or four days.</p><p>The effect of his final appeal had in short faded away, and all thefirst year of her marriage he had dropped out of her books. He was athankless subject of reference; it was disagreeable to have to think ofa person who was sore and sombre about you and whom you could yet donothing to relieve. It would have been different if she had been ableto doubt, even a little, of his unreconciled state, as she doubted ofLord Warburton's; unfortunately it was beyond question, and thisaggressive, uncompromising look of it was just what made itunattractive. She could never say to herself that here was a suffererwho had compensations, as she was able to say in the case of herEnglish suitor. She had no faith in Mr. Goodwood's compensations and noesteem for them. A cotton factory was not a compensation foranything--least of all for having failed to marry Isabel Archer. Andyet, beyond that, she hardly knew what he had--save of course hisintrinsic qualities. Oh, he was intrinsic enough; she never thought ofhis even looking for artificial aids. If he extended hisbusiness--that, to the best of her belief, was the only form exertioncould take with him--it would be because it was an enterprising thing,or good for the business; not in the least because he might hope itwould overlay the past. This gave his figure a kind of bareness andbleakness which made the accident of meeting it in memory or inapprehension a peculiar concussion; it was deficient in the socialdrapery commonly muffling, in an overcivilized age, the sharpness ofhuman contacts. His perfect silence, moreover, the fact that she neverheard from him and very seldom heard any mention of him, deepened thisimpression of his loneliness. She asked Lily for news of him, from timeto time; but Lily knew nothing of Boston--her imagination was allbounded on the east by Madison Avenue. As time went on Isabel hadthought of him oftener, and with fewer restrictions; she had had morethan once the idea of writing to him. She had never told her husbandabout him--never let Osmond know of his visits to her in Florence; areserve not dictated in the early period by a want of confidence inOsmond, but simply by the consideration that the young man'sdisappointment was not her secret but his own. It would be wrong ofher, she had believed, to convey it to another, and Mr. Goodwood'saffairs could have, after all, little interest for Gilbert. When it hadcome to the point she had never written to him; it seemed to her that,considering his grievance, the least she could do was to let him alone.Nevertheless she would have been glad to be in some way nearer to him.It was not that it ever occurred to her that she might have marriedhim; even after the consequences of her actual union had grown vivid toher that particular reflection, though she indulged in so many, had nothad the assurance to present itself. But on finding herself in troublehe had become a member of that circle of things with which she wishedto set herself right. I have mentioned how passionately she needed tofeel that her unhappiness should not have come to her through her ownfault. She had no near prospect of dying, and yet she wished to makeher peace with the world-- to put her spiritual affairs in order. Itcame back to her from time to time that there was an account still tobe settled with Caspar, and she saw herself disposed or able to settleit to-day on terms easier for him than ever before. Still, when shelearned he was coming to Rome she felt all afraid; it would be moredisagreeable for him than for any one else to make out--since he WOULDmake it out, as over a falsified balance-sheet or something of thatsort--the intimate disarray of her affairs. Deep in her breast shebelieved that he had invested his all in her happiness, while theothers had invested only a part. He was one more person from whom sheshould have to conceal her stress. She was reassured, however, after hearrived in Rome, for he spent several days without coming to see her.</p><p>Henrietta Stackpole, it may well be imagined, was more punctual, andIsabel was largely favoured with the society of her friend. She threwherself into it, for now that she had made such a point of keeping herconscience clear, that was one way of proving she had not beensuperficial--the more so as the years, in their flight, had ratherenriched than blighted those peculiarities which had been humorouslycriticised by persons less interested than Isabel, and which were stillmarked enough to give loyalty a spice of heroism. Henrietta was as keenand quick and fresh as ever, and as neat and bright and fair. Herremarkably open eyes, lighted like great glazed railway-stations, hadput up no shutters; her attire had lost none of its crispness, heropinions none of their national reference. She was by no means quiteunchanged, however it struck Isabel she had grown vague. Of old she hadnever been vague; though undertaking many enquiries at once, she hadmanaged to be entire and pointed about each. She had a reason foreverything she did; she fairly bristled with motives. Formerly, whenshe came to Europe it was because she wished to see it, but now, havingalready seen it, she had no such excuse. She didn't for a momentpretend that the desire to examine decaying civilisations had anythingto do with her present enterprise; her journey was rather an expressionof her independence of the old world than of a sense of furtherobligations to it. "It's nothing to come to Europe," she said toIsabel; "it doesn't seem to me one needs so many reasons for that. Itis something to stay at home; this is much more important." It was nottherefore with a sense of doing anything very important that shetreated herself to another pilgrimage to Rome; she had seen the placebefore and carefully inspected it; her present act was simply a sign offamiliarity, of her knowing all about it, of her having as good a rightas any one else to be there. This was all very well, and Henrietta wasrestless; she had a perfect right to be restless too, if one came tothat. But she had after all a better reason for coming to Rome thanthat she cared for it so little. Her friend easily recognised it, andwith it the worth of the other's fidelity. She had crossed the stormyocean in midwinter because she had guessed that Isabel was sad.Henrietta guessed a great deal, but she had never guessed so happily asthat. Isabel's satisfactions just now were few, but even if they hadbeen more numerous there would still have been something of individualjoy in her sense of being justified in having always thought highly ofHenrietta. She had made large concessions with regard to her, and hadyet insisted that, with all abatements, she was very valuable. It wasnot her own triumph, however, that she found good; it was simply therelief of confessing to this confidant, the first person to whom shehad owned it, that she was not in the least at her ease. Henrietta hadherself approached this point with the smallest possible delay, and hadaccused her to her face of being wretched. She was a woman, she was asister; she was not Ralph, nor Lord Warburton, nor Caspar Goodwood, andIsabel could speak.</p><p>"Yes, I'm wretched," she said very mildly. She hated to hear herself say it; she tried to say it as judicially as possible.</p><p>"What does he do to you?" Henrietta asked, frowning as if she were enquiring into the operations of a quack doctor.</p><p>"He does nothing. But he doesn't like me."</p><p>"He's very hard to please!" cried Miss Stackpole. "Why don't you leave him?"</p><p>"I can't change that way," Isabel said.</p><p>"Why not, I should like to know? You won't confess that you've made a mistake. You're too proud."</p><p>"I don't know whether I'm too proud. But I can't publish my mistake. I don't think that's decent. I'd much rather die."</p><p>"You won't think so always," said Henrietta.</p><p>"I don't know what great unhappiness might bring me to; but it seemsto me I shall always be ashamed. One must accept one's deeds. I marriedhim before all the world; I was perfectly free; it was impossible to doanything more deliberate. One can't change that way," Isabel repeated.</p><p>"You HAVE changed, in spite of the impossibility. I hope you don't mean to say you like him."</p><p>Isabel debated. "No, I don't like him. I can tell you, because I'mweary of my secret. But that's enough; I can't announce it on thehousetops."</p><p>Henrietta gave a laugh. "Don't you think you're rather too considerate?"</p><p>"It's not of him that I'm considerate--it's of myself!" Isabel answered.</p><p>It was not surprising Gilbert Osmond should not have taken comfortin Miss Stackpole; his instinct had naturally set him in opposition toa young lady capable of advising his wife to withdraw from the conjugalroof. When she arrived in Rome he had said to Isabel that he hoped shewould leave her friend the interviewer alone; and Isabel had answeredthat he at least had nothing to fear from her. She said to Henriettathat as Osmond didn't like her she couldn't invite her to dine, butthey could easily see each other in other ways. Isabel received MissStackpole freely in her own sitting-room, and took her repeatedly todrive, face to face with Pansy, who, bending a little forward, on theopposite seat of the carriage, gazed at the celebrated authoress with arespectful attention which Henrietta occasionally found irritating. Shecomplained to Isabel that Miss Osmond had a little look as if sheshould remember everything one said. "I don't want to be rememberedthat way," Miss Stackpole declared; "I consider that my conversationrefers only to the moment, like the morning papers. Your stepdaughter,as she sits there, looks as if she kept all the back numbers and wouldbring them out some day against me." She could not teach herself tothink favourably of Pansy, whose absence of initiative, ofconversation, of personal claims, seemed to her, in a girl of twenty,unnatural and even uncanny. Isabel presently saw that Osmond would haveliked her to urge a little the cause of her friend, insist a littleupon his receiving her, so that he might appear to suffer for goodmanners' sake. Her immediate acceptance of his objections put him toomuch in the wrong--it being in effect one of the disadvantages ofexpressing contempt that you cannot enjoy at the same time the creditof expressing sympathy. Osmond held to his credit, and yet he held tohis objections-- all of which were elements difficult to reconcile. Theright thing would have been that Miss Stackpole should come to dine atPalazzo Roccanera once or twice, so that (in spite of his superficialcivility, always so great) she might judge for herself how littlepleasure it gave him. From the moment, however, that both the ladieswere so unaccommodating, there was nothing for Osmond but to wish thelady from New York would take herself off. It was surprising how littlesatisfaction he got from his wife's friends; he took occasion to callIsabel's attention to it.</p><p>"You're certainly not fortunate in your intimates; I wish you mightmake a new collection," he said to her one morning in reference tonothing visible at the moment, but in a tone of ripe reflection whichdeprived the remark of all brutal abruptness. "It's as if you had takenthe trouble to pick out the people in the world that I have least incommon with. Your cousin I have always thought a conceited ass--besideshis being the most ill-favoured animal I know. Then it's insufferablytiresome that one can't tell him so; one must spare him on account ofhis health. His health seems to me the best part of him; it gives himprivileges enjoyed by no one else. If he's so desperately ill there'sonly one way to prove it; but he seems to have no mind for that. Ican't say much more for the great Warburton. When one really thinks ofit, the cool insolence of that performance was something rare! He comesand looks at one's daughter as if she were a suite of apartments; hetries the door-handles and looks out of the windows, raps on the wallsand almost thinks he'll take the place. Will you be so good as to drawup a lease? Then, on the whole, he decides that the rooms are toosmall; he doesn't think he could live on a third floor; he must lookout for a piano nobile. And he goes away after having got a month'slodging in the poor little apartment for nothing. Miss Stackpole,however, is your most wonderful invention. She strikes me as a kind ofmonster. One hasn't a nerve in one's body that she doesn't setquivering. You know I never have admitted that she's a woman. Do youknow what she reminds me of? Of a new steel pen-- the most odious thingin nature. She talks as a steel pen writes; aren't her letters, by theway, on ruled paper? She thinks and moves and walks and looks exactlyas she talks. You may say that she doesn't hurt me, inasmuch as I don'tsee her. I don't see her, but I hear her; I hear her all day long. Hervoice is in my ears; I can't get rid of it. I know exactly what shesays, and every inflexion of the tone in which she says it. She sayscharming things about me, and they give you great comfort. I don't likeat all to think she talks about me--I feel as I should feel if I knewthe footman were wearing my hat."</p><p>Henrietta talked about Gilbert Osmond, as his wife assured him,rather less than he suspected. She had plenty of other subjects, in twoof which the reader may be supposed to be especially interested. Shelet her friend know that Caspar Goodwood had discovered for himselfthat she was unhappy, though indeed her ingenuity was unable to suggestwhat comfort he hoped to give her by coming to Rome and yet not callingon her. They met him twice in the street, but he had no appearance ofseeing them; they were driving, and he had a habit of looking straightin front of him, as if he proposed to take in but one object at a time.Isabel could have fancied she had seen him the day before; it must havebeen with just that face and step that he had walked out of Mrs.Touchett's door at the close of their last interview. He was dressedjust as he had been dressed on that day, Isabel remembered the colourof his cravat; and yet in spite of this familiar look there was astrangeness in his figure too, something that made her feel it afreshto be rather terrible he should have come to Rome. He looked bigger andmore overtopping than of old, and in those days he certainly reachedhigh enough. She noticed that the people whom he passed looked backafter him; but he went straight forward, lifting above them a face likea February sky.</p><p>Miss Stackpole's other topic was very different; she gave Isabel thelatest news about Mr. Bantling. He had been out in the United Statesthe year before, and she was happy to say she had been able to show himconsiderable attention. She didn't know how much he had enjoyed it, butshe would undertake to say it had done him good; he wasn't the same manwhen he left as he had been when be came. It had opened his eyes andshown him that England wasn't everything. He had been very much likedin most places, and thought extremely simple--more simple than theEnglish were commonly supposed to be. There were people who had thoughthim affected; she didn't know whether they meant that his simplicitywas an affectation. Some of his questions were too discouraging; hethought all the chambermaids were farmers' daughters--or all thefarmers' daughters were chambermaids--she couldn't exactly rememberwhich. He hadn't seemed able to grasp the great school system; it hadbeen really too much for him. On the whole he had behaved as if therewere too much of everything--as if he could only take in a small part.The part he had chosen was the hotel system and the river navigation.He had seemed really fascinated with the hotels; he had a photograph ofevery one he had visited. But the river steamers were his principalinterest; he wanted to do nothing but sail on the big boats. They hadtravelled together from New York to Milwaukee, stopping at the mostinteresting cities on the route; and whenever they started afresh hehad wanted to know if they could go by the steamer. He seemed to haveno idea of geography--had an impression that Baltimore was a Westerncity and was perpetually expecting to arrive at the Mississippi. Heappeared never to have heard of any river in America but theMississippi and was unprepared to recognise the existence of theHudson, though obliged to confess at last that it was fully equal tothe Rhine. They had spent some pleasant hours in the palace-cars; hewas always ordering ice-cream from the coloured man. He could never getused to that idea--that you could get ice-cream in the cars. Of courseyou couldn't, nor fans, nor candy, nor anything in the English cars! Hefound the heat quite overwhelming, and she had told him she indeedexpected it was the biggest he had ever experienced. He was now inEngland, hunting--"hunting round" Henrietta called it. These amusementswere those of the American red men; we had left that behind long ago,the pleasures of the chase. It seemed to be generally believed inEngland that we wore tomahawks and feathers; but such a costume wasmore in keeping with English habits. Mr. Bantling would not have timeto join her in Italy, but when she should go to Paris again he expectedto come over. He wanted very much to see Versailles again; he was veryfond of the ancient regime. They didn't agree about that, but that waswhat she liked Versailles for, that you could see the ancient regimehad been swept away. There were no dukes and marquises there now; sheremembered on the contrary one day when there were five Americanfamilies, walking all round. Mr. Bantling was very anxious that sheshould take up the subject of England again, and he thought she mightget on better with it now; England had changed a good deal within twoor three years. He was determined that if she went there he should goto see his sister, Lady Pensil, and that this time the invitationshould come to her straight. The mystery about that other one had neverbeen explained.</p><p>Caspar Goodwood came at last to Palazzo Roccanera; he had writtenIsabel a note beforehand, to ask leave. This was promptly granted; shewould be at home at six o'clock that afternoon. She spent the daywondering what he was coming for--what good he expected to get of it.He had presented himself hitherto as a person destitute of the facultyof compromise, who would take what he had asked for or take nothing.Isabel's hospitality, however, raised no questions, and she found nogreat difficulty in appearing happy enough to deceive him. It was herconviction at least that she deceived him, made him say to himself thathe had been misinformed. But she also saw, so she believed, that he wasnot disappointed, as some other men, she was sure, would have been; hehad not come to Rome to look for an opportunity. She never found outwhat he had come for; he offered her no explanation; there could benone but the very simple one that he wanted to see her. In other wordshe had come for his amusement. Isabel followed up this induction with agood deal of eagerness, and was delighted to have found a formula thatwould lay the ghost of this gentleman's ancient grievance. If he hadcome to Rome for his amusement this was exactly what she wanted; for ifhe cared for amusement he had got over his heartache. If he had gotover his heartache everything was as it should be and herresponsibilities were at an end. It was true that he took hisrecreation a little stiffly, but he had never been loose and easy andshe had every reason to believe he was satisfied with what he saw.Henrietta was not in his confidence, though he was in hers, and Isabelconsequently received no side-light upon his state of mind. He was opento little conversation on general topics; it came back to her that shehad said of him once, years before, "Mr. Goodwood speaks a good deal,but he doesn't talk." He spoke a good deal now, but he talked perhapsas little as ever; considering, that is, how much there was in Rome totalk about. His arrival was not calculated to simplify her relationswith her husband, for if Mr. Osmond didn't like her friends Mr.Goodwood had no claim upon his attention save as having been one of thefirst of them. There was nothing for her to say of him but that he wasthe very oldest; this rather meagre synthesis exhausted the facts. Shehad been obliged to introduce him to Gilbert; it was impossible sheshould not ask him to dinner, to her Thursday evenings, of which shehad grown very weary, but to which her husband still held for the sakenot so much of inviting people as of not inviting them.</p><p>To the Thursdays Mr. Goodwood came regularly, solemnly, ratherearly; he appeared to regard them with a good deal of gravity. Isabelevery now and then had a moment of anger; there was something soliteral about him; she thought he might know that she didn't know whatto do with him. But she couldn't call him stupid; he was not that inthe least; he was only extraordinarily honest. To be as honest as thatmade a man very different from most people; one had to be almostequally honest with HIM. She made this latter reflection at the verytime she was flattering herself she had persuaded him that she was themost light-hearted of women. He never threw any doubt on this point,never asked her any personal questions. He got on much better withOsmond than had seemed probable. Osmond had a great dislike to beingcounted on; in such a case be had an irresistible need of disappointingyou. It was in virtue of this principle that he gave himself theentertainment of taking a fancy to a perpendicular Bostonian whom hebad been depended upon to treat with coldness. He asked Isabel if Mr.Goodwood also had wanted to marry her, and expressed surprise at hernot having accepted him. It would have been an excellent thing, likeliving under some tall belfry which would strike all the hours and makea queer vibration in the upper air. He declared he liked to talk withthe great Goodwood; it wasn't easy at first, you had to climb up aninterminable steep staircase up to the top of the tower; but when yougot there you had a big view and felt a little fresh breeze. Osmond, aswe know, had delightful qualities, and he gave Caspar Goodwood thebenefit of them all. Isabel could see that Mr. Goodwood thought betterof her husband than he had ever wished to; he had given her theimpression that morning in Florence of being inaccessible to a goodimpression. Gilbert asked him repeatedly to dinner, and Mr. Goodwoodsmoked a cigar with him afterwards and even desired to be shown hiscollections. Gilbert said to Isabel that he was very original; he wasas strong and of as good a style as an English portmanteau,--he hadplenty of straps and buckles which would never wear out, and a capitalpatent lock. Caspar Goodwood took to riding on the Campagna and devotedmuch time to this exercise; it was therefore mainly in the evening thatIsabel saw him. She bethought herself of saying to him one day that ifhe were willing he could render her a service. And then she addedsmiling:</p><p>"I don't know, however, what right I have to ask a service of you."</p><p>"You're the person in the world who has most right," he answered."I've given you assurances that I've never given any one else."</p><p>The service was that he should go and see her cousin Ralph, who wasill at the Hotel de Paris, alone, and be as kind to him as possible.Mr. Goodwood had never seen him, but he would know who the poor fellowwas; if she was not mistaken Ralph had once invited him to Gardencourt.Caspar remembered the invitation perfectly, and, though he was notsupposed to be a man of imagination, had enough to put himself in theplace of a poor gentleman who lay dying at a Roman inn. He called atthe Hotel de Paris and, on being shown into the presence of the masterof Gardencourt, found Miss Stackpole sitting beside his sofa. Asingular change had in fact occurred in this lady's relations withRalph Touchett. She had not been asked by Isabel to go and see him, buton hearing that he was too ill to come out had immediately gone of herown motion. After this she had paid him a daily visit--always under theconviction that they were great enemies. "Oh yes, we're intimateenemies," Ralph used to say; and he accused her freely--as freely asthe humour of it would allow --of coming to worry him to death. Inreality they became excellent friends, Henrietta much wondering thatshe should never have liked him before. Ralph liked her exactly as muchas he had always done; he had never doubted for a moment that she wasan excellent fellow. They talked about everything and always differed;about everything, that is, but Isabel--a topic as to which Ralph alwayshad a thin forefinger on his lips. Mr. Bantling on the other handproved a great resource; Ralph was capable of discussing Mr. Bantlingwith Henrietta for hours. Discussion was stimulated of course by theirinevitable difference of view--Ralph having amused himself with takingthe ground that the genial ex-guardsman was a regular Machiavelli.Caspar Goodwood could contribute nothing to such a debate; but after hehad been left alone with his host he found there were various othermatters they could take up. It must be admitted that the lady who hadjust gone out was not one of these; Caspar granted all Miss Stackpole'smerits in advance, but had no further remark to make about her.Neither, after the first allusions, did the two men expatiate upon Mrs.Osmond--a theme in which Goodwood perceived as many dangers as Ralph.He felt very sorry for that unclassable personage; he couldn't bear tosee a pleasant man, so pleasant for all his queerness, so beyondanything to be done. There was always something to be done, forGoodwood, and he did it in this case by repeating several times hisvisit to the Hotel de Paris. It seemed to Isabel that she had been veryclever; she had artfully disposed of the superfluous Caspar. She hadgiven him an occupation; she had converted him into a caretaker ofRalph. She had a plan of making him travel northward with her cousin assoon as the first mild weather should allow it. Lord Warburton hadbrought Ralph to Rome and Mr. Goodwood should take him away. Thereseemed a happy symmetry in this, and she was now intensely eager thatRalph should depart. She had a constant fear he would die there beforeher eyes and a horror of the occurrence of this event at an inn, by herdoor, which he had so rarely entered. Ralph must sink to his last restin his own dear house, in one of those deep, dim chambers ofGardencourt where the dark ivy would cluster round the edges of theglimmering window. There seemed to Isabel in these days somethingsacred in Gardencourt; no chapter of the past was more perfectlyirrecoverable. When she thought of the months she had spent there thetears rose to her eyes. She flattered herself, as I say, upon heringenuity, but she had need of all she could muster; for several eventsoccurred which seemed to confront and defy her. The Countess Geminiarrived from Florence--arrived with her trunks, her dresses, herchatter, her falsehoods, her frivolity, the strange, the unholy legendof the number of her lovers. Edward Rosier, who had been awaysomewhere,--no one, not even Pansy, knew where,--reappeared in Rome andbegan to write her long letters, which she never answered. Madame Merlereturned from Naples and said to her with a strange smile: "What onearth did you do with Lord Warburton?" As if it were any business ofhers!</p></span><span id = 997 ><p>One day, toward the end of February, Ralph Touchett made up his mindto return to England. He had his own reasons for this decision, whichhe was not bound to communicate; but Henrietta Stackpole, to whom hementioned his intention, flattered herself that she guessed them. Sheforbore to express them, however; she only said, after a moment, as shesat by his sofa: "I suppose you know you can't go alone?"</p><p>"I've no idea of doing that," Ralph answered. "I shall have people with me."</p><p>"What do you mean by 'people'? Servants whom you pay?"</p><p>"Ah," said Ralph jocosely, "after all, they're human beings."</p><p>"Are there any women among them?" Miss Stackpole desired to know.</p><p>"You speak as if I had a dozen! No, I confess I haven't a soubrette in my employment."</p><p>"Well," said Henrietta calmly, "you can't go to England that way. You must have a woman's care."</p><p>"I've had so much of yours for the past fortnight that it will last me a good while."</p><p>"You've not had enough of it yet. I guess I'll go with you," said Henrietta.</p><p>"Go with me?" Ralph slowly raised himself from his sofa.</p><p>"Yes, I know you don't like me, but I'll go with you all the same. It would be better for your health to lie down again."</p><p>Ralph looked at her a little; then he slowly relapsed. "I like you very much," he said in a moment.</p><p>Miss Stackpole gave one of her infrequent laughs. "You needn't thinkthat by saying that you can buy me off. I'll go with you, and what ismore I'll take care of you."</p><p>"You're a very good woman," said Ralph.</p><p>"Wait till I get you safely home before you say that. It won't be easy. But you had better go, all the same."</p><p>Before she left him, Ralph said to her: "Do you really mean to take care of me?"</p><p>"Well, I mean to try."</p><p>"I notify you then that I submit. Oh, I submit!" And it was perhapsa sign of submission that a few minutes after she had left him alone heburst into a loud fit of laughter. It seemed to him so inconsequent,such a conclusive proof of his having abdicated all functions andrenounced all exercise, that he should start on a journey across Europeunder the supervision of Miss Stackpole. And the great oddity was thatthe prospect pleased him; he was gratefully, luxuriously passive. Hefelt even impatient to start; and indeed he had an immense longing tosee his own house again. The end of everything was at hand; it seemedto him he could stretch out his arm and touch the goal. But he wantedto die at home; it was the only wish he had left--to extend himself inthe large quiet room where he had last seen his father lie, and closehis eyes upon the summer dawn.</p><p>That same day Caspar Goodwood came to see him, and he informed hisvisitor that Miss Stackpole had taken him up and was to conduct himback to England. "Ah then," said Caspar, "I'm afraid I shall be a fifthwheel to the coach. Mrs. Osmond has made me promise to go with you."</p><p>"Good heavens--it's the golden age! You're all too kind."</p><p>"The kindness on my part is to her; it's hardly to you."</p><p>"Granting that, SHE'S kind," smiled Ralph.</p><p>"To get people to go with you? Yes, that's a sort of kindness,"Goodwood answered without lending himself to the joke. "For myself,however," he added, "I'll go so far as to say that I would much rathertravel with you and Miss Stackpole than with Miss Stackpole alone."</p><p>"And you'd rather stay here than do either," said Ralph. "There'sreally no need of your coming. Henrietta's extraordinarily efficient."</p><p>"I'm sure of that. But I've promised Mrs. Osmond."</p><p>"You can easily get her to let you off."</p><p>"She wouldn't let me off for the world. She wants me to look afteryou, but that isn't the principal thing. The principal thing is thatshe wants me to leave Rome."</p><p>"Ah, you see too much in it," Ralph suggested.</p><p>"I bore her," Goodwood went on; "she has nothing to say to me, so she invented that."</p><p>"Oh then, if it's a convenience to her I certainly will take youwith me. Though I don't see why it should be a convenience," Ralphadded in a moment.</p><p>"Well," said Caspar Goodwood simply, "she thinks I'm watching her."</p><p>"Watching her?"</p><p>"Trying to make out if she's happy."</p><p>"That's easy to make out," said Ralph. "She's the most visibly happy woman I know."</p><p>"Exactly so; I'm satisfied," Goodwood answered dryly. For all hisdryness, however, he had more to say. "I've been watching her; I was anold friend and it seemed to me I had the right. She pretends to behappy; that was what she undertook to be; and I thought I should liketo see for myself what it amounts to. I've seen," he continued with aharsh ring in his voice, "and I don't want to see any more. I'm nowquite ready to go."</p><p>"Do you know it strikes me as about time you should?" Ralphrejoined. And this was the only conversation these gentlemen had aboutIsabel Osmond.</p><p>Henrietta made her preparations for departure, and among them shefound it proper to say a few words to the Countess Gemini, who returnedat Miss Stackpole's pension the visit which this lady had paid her inFlorence.</p><p>"You were very wrong about Lord Warburton," she remarked to the Countess. "I think it right you should know that."</p><p>"About his making love to Isabel? My poor lady, he was at her housethree times a day. He has left traces of his passage!" the Countesscried.</p><p>"He wished to marry your niece; that's why he came to the house."</p><p>The Countess stared, and then with an inconsiderate laugh: "Is thatthe story that Isabel tells? It isn't bad, as such things go. If hewishes to marry my niece, pray why doesn't he do it? Perhaps he hasgone to buy the wedding-ring and will come back with it next month,after I'm gone."</p><p>"No, he'll not come back. Miss Osmond doesn't wish to marry him."</p><p>"She's very accommodating! I knew she was fond of Isabel, but I didn't know she carried it so far."</p><p>"I don't understand you," said Henrietta coldly, and reflecting thatthe Countess was unpleasantly perverse. "I really must stick to mypoint--that Isabel never encouraged the attentions of Lord Warburton."</p><p>"My dear friend, what do you and I know about it? All we know is that my brother's capable of everything."</p><p>"I don't know what your brother's capable of," said Henrietta with dignity.</p><p>"It's not her encouraging Warburton that I complain of; it's hersending him away. I want particularly to see him. Do you suppose shethought I would make him faithless?" the Countess continued withaudacious insistence. "However, she's only keeping him, one can feelthat. The house is full of him there; he's quite in the air. Oh yes, hehas left traces; I'm sure I shall see him yet."</p><p>"Well," said Henrietta after a little, with one of thoseinspirations which had made the fortune of her letters to theInterviewer, "perhaps he'll be more successful with you than withIsabel!"</p><p>When she told her friend of the offer she had made Ralph Isabelreplied that she could have done nothing that would have pleased hermore. It had always been her faith that at bottom Ralph and this youngwoman were made to understand each other. "I don't care whether heunderstands me or not," Henrietta declared. "The great thing is that heshouldn't die in the cars."</p><p>"He won't do that," Isabel said, shaking her head with an extension of faith.</p><p>"He won't if I can help it. I see you want us all to go. I don't know what you want to do."</p><p>"I want to be alone," said Isabel.</p><p>"You won't be that so long as you've so much company at home."</p><p>"Ah, they're part of the comedy. You others are spectators."</p><p>"Do you call it a comedy, Isabel Archer?" Henrietta rather grimly asked.</p><p>"The tragedy then if you like. You're all looking at me; it makes me uncomfortable."</p><p>Henrietta engaged in this act for a while. "You're like the strickendeer, seeking the innermost shade. Oh, you do give me such a sense ofhelplessness!" she broke out.</p><p>"I'm not at all helpless. There are many things I mean to do."</p><p>"It's not you I'm speaking of; it's myself. It's too much, having come on purpose, to leave you just as I find you."</p><p>"You don't do that; you leave me much refreshed," Isabel said.</p><p>"Very mild refreshment--sour lemonade! I want you to promise me something."</p><p>"I can't do that. I shall never make another promise. I made such asolemn one four years ago, and I've succeeded so ill in keeping it."</p><p>"You've had no encouragement. In this case I should give you thegreatest. Leave your husband before the worst comes; that's what I wantyou to promise."</p><p>"The worst? What do you call the worst?"</p><p>"Before your character gets spoiled."</p><p>"Do you mean my disposition? It won't get spoiled," Isabel answered,smiling. "I'm taking very good care of it. I'm extremely struck," sheadded, turning away, "with the off-hand way in which you speak of awoman's leaving her husband. It's easy to see you've never had one!"</p><p>"Well," said Henrietta as if she were beginning an argument,"nothing is more common in our Western cities, and it's to them, afterall, that we must look in the future." Her argument, however, does notconcern this history, which has too many other threads to unwind. Sheannounced to Ralph Touchett that she was ready to leave Rome by anytrain he might designate, and Ralph immediately pulled himself togetherfor departure. Isabel went to see him at the last, and he made the sameremark that Henrietta had made. It struck him that Isabel wasuncommonly glad to get rid of them all.</p><p>For all answer to this she gently laid her hand on his, and said in a low tone, with a quick smile: "My dear Ralph--!"</p><p>It was answer enough, and he was quite contented. But he went on inthe same way, jocosely, ingenuously: "I've seen less of you than Imight, but it's better than nothing. And then I've heard a great dealabout you."</p><p>"I don't know from whom, leading the life you've done."</p><p>"From the voices of the air! Oh, from no one else; I never let otherpeople speak of you. They always say you're 'charming,' and that's soflat."</p><p>"I might have seen more of you certainly," Isabel said. "But when one's married one has so much occupation."</p><p>"Fortunately I'm not married. When you come to see me in England Ishall be able to entertain you with all the freedom of a bachelor." Hecontinued to talk as if they should certainly meet again, and succeededin making the assumption appear almost just. He made no allusion to histerm being near, to the probability that he should not outlast thesummer. If he preferred it so, Isabel was willing enough; the realitywas sufficiently distinct without their erecting finger-posts inconversation. That had been well enough for the earlier time, thoughabout this, as about his other affairs, Ralph had never been egotistic.Isabel spoke of his journey, of the stages into which he should divideit, of the precautions he should take. "Henrietta's my greatestprecaution," he went on. "The conscience of that woman's sublime."</p><p>"Certainly she'll be very conscientious."</p><p>"Will be? She has been! It's only because she thinks it's her duty that she goes with me. There's a conception of duty for you."</p><p>"Yes, it's a generous one," said Isabel, "and it makes me deeply ashamed. I ought to go with you, you know."</p><p>"Your husband wouldn't like that."</p><p>"No, he wouldn't like it. But I might go, all the same."</p><p>"I'm startled by the boldness of your imagination. Fancy my being a cause of disagreement between a lady and her husband!"</p><p>"That's why I don't go," said Isabel simply--yet not very lucidly.</p><p>Ralph understood well enough, however. "I should think so, with all those occupations you speak of."</p><p>"It isn't that. I'm afraid," said Isabel. After a pause sherepeated, as if to make herself, rather than him, hear the words: "I'mafraid."</p><p>Ralph could hardly tell what her tone meant; it was so strangelydeliberate--apparently so void of emotion. Did she wish to do publicpenance for a fault of which she had not been convicted? or were herwords simply an attempt at enlightened self-analysis? However thismight be, Ralph could not resist so easy an opportunity. "Afraid ofyour husband?"</p><p>"Afraid of myself!" she said, getting up. She stood there a momentand then added: "If I were afraid of my husband that would be simply myduty. That's what women are expected to be."</p><p>"Ah yes," laughed Ralph; "but to make up for it there's always some man awfully afraid of some woman!"</p><p>She gave no heed to this pleasantry, but suddenly took a differentturn. "With Henrietta at the head of your little band," she exclaimedabruptly, "there will be nothing left for Mr. Goodwood!"</p><p>"Ah, my dear Isabel," Ralph answered, "he's used to that. There is nothing left for Mr. Goodwood."</p><p>She coloured and then observed, quickly, that she must leave him.They stood together a moment; both her hands were in both of his."You've been my best friend," she said.</p><p>"It was for you that I wanted--that I wanted to live. But I'm of no use to you."</p><p>Then it came over her more poignantly that she should not see himagain. She could not accept that; she could not part with him that way."If you should send for me I'd come," she said at last.</p><p>"Your husband won't consent to that."</p><p>"Oh yes, I can arrange it."</p><p>"I shall keep that for my last pleasure!" said Ralph.</p><p>In answer to which she simply kissed him. It was a Thursday, andthat evening Caspar Goodwood came to Palazzo Roccanera. He was amongthe first to arrive, and he spent some time in conversation withGilbert Osmond, who almost always was present when his wife received.They sat down together, and Osmond, talkative, communicative,expansive, seemed possessed with a kind of intellectual gaiety. Heleaned back with his legs crossed, lounging and chatting, whileGoodwood, more restless, but not at all lively, shifted his position,played with his hat, made the little sofa creak beneath him. Osmond'sface wore a sharp, aggressive smile; he was as a man whose perceptionshave been quickened by good news. He remarked to Goodwood that he wassorry they were to lose him; he himself should particularly miss him.He saw so few intelligent men--they were surprisingly scarce in Rome.He must be sure to come back; there was something very refreshing, toan inveterate Italian like himself, in talking with a genuine outsider.</p><p>"I'm very fond of Rome, you know," Osmond said; "but there's nothingI like better than to meet people who haven't that superstition. Themodern world's after all very fine. Now you're thoroughly modern andyet are not at all common. So many of the moderns we see are such verypoor stuff. If they're the children of the future we're willing to dieyoung. Of course the ancients too are often very tiresome. My wife andI like everything that's really new--not the mere pretence of it.There's nothing new, unfortunately, in ignorance and stupidity. We seeplenty of that in forms that offer themselves as a revelation ofprogress, of light. A revelation of vulgarity! There's a certain kindof vulgarity which I believe is really new; I don't think there everwas anything like it before. Indeed I don't find vulgarity, at all,before the present century. You see a faint menace of it here and therein the last, but to-day the air has grown so dense that delicate thingsare literally not recognised. Now, we've liked you--!" With which hehesitated a moment, laying his hand gently on Goodwood's knee andsmiling with a mixture of assurance and embarrassment. "I'm going tosay something extremely offensive and patronising, but you must let mehave the satisfaction of it. We've liked you because--because you'vereconciled us a little to the future. If there are to be a certainnumber of people like you--a la bonne heure! I'm talking for my wife aswell as for myself, you see. She speaks for me, my wife; why shouldn'tI speak for her? We're as united, you know, as the candlestick and thesnuffers. Am I assuming too much when I say that I think I'veunderstood from you that your occupations have been--a-- commercial?There's a danger in that, you know; but it's the way you have escapedthat strikes us. Excuse me if my little compliment seems in execrabletaste; fortunately my wife doesn't hear me. What I mean is that youmight have been--a--what I was mentioning just now. The whole Americanworld was in a conspiracy to make you so. But you resisted, you'vesomething about you that saved you. And yet you're so modern, somodern; the most modern man we know! We shall always be delighted tosee you again."</p><p>I have said that Osmond was in good humour, and these remarks willgive ample evidence of the fact. They were infinitely more personalthan he usually cared to be, and if Caspar Goodwood had attended tothem more closely he might have thought that the defence of delicacywas in rather odd hands. We may believe, however, that Osmond knew verywell what he was about, and that if he chose to use the tone ofpatronage with a grossness not in his habits he had an excellent reasonfor the escapade. Goodwood had only a vague sense that he was laying iton somehow; he scarcely knew where the mixture was applied. Indeed hescarcely knew what Osmond was talking about; he wanted to be alone withIsabel, and that idea spoke louder to him than her husband'sperfectly-pitched voice. He watched her talking with other people andwondered when she would be at liberty and whether he might ask her togo into one of the other rooms. His humour was not, like Osmond's, ofthe best; there was an element of dull rage in his consciousness ofthings. Up to this time he had not disliked Osmond personally; he hadonly thought him very well-informed and obliging and more than he hadsupposed like the person whom Isabel Archer would naturally marry. Hishost had won in the open field a great advantage over him, and Goodwoodhad too strong a sense of fair play to have been moved to underrate himon that account. He had not tried positively to think well of him; thiswas a flight of sentimental benevolence of which, even in the days whenhe came nearest to reconciling himself to what had happened, Goodwoodwas quite incapable. He accepted him as rather a brilliant personage ofthe amateurish kind, afflicted with a redundancy of leisure which itamused him to work off in little refinements of conversation. But heonly half trusted him; he could never make out why the deuce Osmondshould lavish refinements of any sort upon HIM. It made him suspectthat he found some private entertainment in it, and it ministered to ageneral impression that his triumphant rival had in his composition astreak of perversity. He knew indeed that Osmond could have no reasonto wish him evil; he had nothing to fear from him. He had carried off asupreme advantage and could afford to be kind to a man who had losteverything. It was true that Goodwood had at times grimly wished hewere dead and would have liked to kill him; but Osmond had no means ofknowing this, for practice had made the younger man perfect in the artof appearing inaccessible to-day to any violent emotion. He cultivatedthis art in order to deceive himself, but it was others that hedeceived first. He cultivated it, moreover, with very limited success;of which there could be no better proof than the deep, dumb irritationthat reigned in his soul when he heard Osmond speak of his wife'sfeelings as if he were commissioned to answer for them.</p><p>That was all he had had an ear for in what his host said to him thisevening; he had been conscious that Osmond made more of a point eventhan usual of referring to the conjugal harmony prevailing at PalazzoRoccanera. He had been more careful than ever to speak as if he and hiswife had all things in sweet community and it were as natural to eachof them to say "we" as to say "I". In all this there was an air ofintention that had puzzled and angered our poor Bostonian, who couldonly reflect for his comfort that Mrs. Osmond's relations with herhusband were none of his business. He had no proof whatever that herhusband misrepresented her, and if he judged her by the surface ofthings was bound to believe that she liked her life. She had nevergiven him the faintest sign of discontent. Miss Stackpole had told himthat she had lost her illusions, but writing for the papers had madeMiss Stackpole sensational. She was too fond of early news. Moreover,since her arrival in Rome she had been much on her guard; she hadpretty well ceased to flash her lantern at him. This indeed, it may besaid for her, would have been quite against her conscience. She had nowseen the reality of Isabel's situation, and it had inspired her with ajust reserve. Whatever could be done to improve it the most useful formof assistance would not be to inflame her former lovers with a sense ofher wrongs. Miss Stackpole continued to take a deep interest in thestate of Mr. Goodwood's feelings, but she showed it at present only bysending him choice extracts, humorous and other, from the Americanjournals, of which she received several by every post and which shealways perused with a pair of scissors in her hand. The articles shecut out she placed in an envelope addressed to Mr. Goodwood, which sheleft with her own hand at his hotel. He never asked her a questionabout Isabel: hadn't he come five thousand miles to see for himself? Hewas thus not in the least authorised to think Mrs. Osmond unhappy; butthe very absence of authorisation operated as an irritant, ministeredto the harsh- ness with which, in spite of his theory that he hadceased to care, he now recognised that, so far as she was concerned,the future had nothing more for him. He had not even the satisfactionof knowing the truth; apparently he could not even be trusted torespect her if she WERE unhappy. He was hopeless, helpless, useless. Tothis last character she had called his attention by her ingenious planfor making him leave Rome. He had no objection whatever to doing whathe could for her cousin, but it made him grind his teeth to think thatof all the services she might have asked of him this was the one shehad been eager to select. There had been no danger of her choosing onethat would have kept him in Rome.</p><p>To-night what he was chiefly thinking of was that he was to leaveher to-morrow and that he had gained nothing by coming but theknowledge that he was as little wanted as ever. About herself he hadgained no knowledge; she was imperturbable, inscrutable, impenetrable.He felt the old bitterness, which he had tried so hard to swallow, riseagain in his throat, and he knew there are disappointments that last aslong as life. Osmond went on talking; Goodwood was vaguely aware thathe was touching again upon his perfect intimacy with his wife. Itseemed to him for a moment that the man had a kind of demonicimagination; it was impossible that without malice he should haveselected so unusual a topic. But what did it matter, after all, whetherhe were demonic or not, and whether she loved him or hated him? Shemight hate him to the death without one's gaining a straw one's self."You travel, by the by, with Ralph Touchett," Osmond said. "I supposethat means you'll move slowly?"</p><p>"I don't know. I shall do just as he likes."</p><p>"You're very accommodating. We're immensely obliged to you; you mustreally let me say it. My wife has probably expressed to you what wefeel. Touchett has been on our minds all winter; it has looked morethan once as if he would never leave Rome. He ought never to have come;it's worse than an imprudence for people in that state to travel; it'sa kind of indelicacy. I wouldn't for the world be under such anobligation to Touchett as he has been to--to my wife and me. Otherpeople inevitably have to look after him, and every one isn't sogenerous as you."</p><p>"I've nothing else to do," Caspar said dryly.</p><p>Osmond looked at him a moment askance. "You ought to marry, and thenyou'd have plenty to do! It's true that in that case you wouldn't bequite so available for deeds of mercy."</p><p>"Do you find that as a married man you're so much occupied?" the young man mechanically asked.</p><p>"Ah, you see, being married's in itself an occupation. It isn'talways active; it's often passive; but that takes even more attention.Then my wife and I do so many things together. We read, we study, wemake music, we walk, we drive--we talk even, as when we first knew eachother. I delight, to this hour, in my wife's conversation. If you'reever bored take my advice and get married. Your wife indeed may boreyou, in that case; but you'll never bore yourself. You'll always havesomething to say to yourself--always have a subject of reflection."</p><p>"I'm not bored," said Goodwood. "I've plenty to think about and to say to myself."</p><p>"More than to say to others!" Osmond exclaimed with a light laugh."Where shall you go next? I mean after you've consigned Touchett to hisnatural caretakers--I believe his mother's at last coming back to lookafter him. That little lady's superb; she neglects her duties with afinish--! Perhaps you'll spend the summer in England?"</p><p>"I don't know. I've no plans."</p><p>"Happy man! That's a little bleak, but it's very free."</p><p>"Oh yes, I'm very free."</p><p>"Free to come back to Rome I hope," said Osmond as he saw a group ofnew visitors enter the room. "Remember that when you do come we counton you!"</p><p>Goodwood had meant to go away early, but the evening elapsed withouthis having a chance to speak to Isabel otherwise than as one of severalassociated interlocutors. There was something perverse in theinveteracy with which she avoided him; his unquenchable rancourdiscovered an intention where there was certainly no appearance of one.There was absolutely no appearance of one. She met his eyes with herclear hospitable smile, which seemed almost to ask that he would comeand help her to entertain some of her visitors. To such suggestions,however, he opposed but a stiff impatience. He wandered about andwaited; he talked to the few people he knew, who found him for thefirst time rather self-contradictory. This was indeed rare with CasparGoodwood, though he often contradicted others. There was often music atPalazzo Roccanera, and it was usually very good. Under cover of themusic he managed to contain himself; but toward the end, when he sawthe people beginning to go, he drew near to Isabel and asked her in alow tone if he might not speak to her in one of the other rooms, whichhe had just assured himself was empty. She smiled as if she wished tooblige him but found her self absolutely prevented. "I'm afraid it'simpossible. People are saying good-night, and I must be where they cansee me."</p><p>"I shall wait till they are all gone then."</p><p>She hesitated a moment. "Ah, that will be delightful!" she exclaimed.</p><p>And he waited, though it took a long time yet. There were severalpeople, at the end, who seemed tethered to the carpet. The CountessGemini, who was never herself till midnight, as she said, displayed noconsciousness that the entertainment was over; she had still a littlecircle of gentlemen in front of the fire, who every now and then brokeinto a united laugh. Osmond had disappeared--he never bade good-bye topeople; and as the Countess was extending her range, according to hercustom at this period of the evening, Isabel had sent Pansy to bed.Isabel sat a little apart; she too appeared to wish her sister-in-lawwould sound a lower note and let the last loiterers depart in peace.</p><p>"May I not say a word to you now?" Goodwood presently asked her. Shegot up immediately, smiling. "Certainly, we'll go somewhere else if youlike." They went together, leaving the Countess with her little circle,and for a moment after they had crossed the threshold neither of themspoke. Isabel would not sit down; she stood in the middle of the roomslowly fanning herself; she had for him the same familiar grace. Sheseemed to wait for him to speak. Now that he was alone with her all thepassion he had never stifled surged into his senses; it hummed in hiseyes and made things swim round him. The bright, empty room grew dimand blurred, and through the heaving veil he felt her hover before himwith gleaming eyes and parted lips. If he had seen more distinctly hewould have perceived her smile was fixed and a trifle forced--that shewas frightened at what she saw in his own face. "I suppose you wish tobid me goodbye?" she said.</p><p>"Yes--but I don't like it. I don't want to leave Rome," he answered with almost plaintive honesty.</p><p>"I can well imagine. It's wonderfully good of you. I can't tell you how kind I think you."</p><p>For a moment more he said nothing. "With a few words like that you make me go."</p><p>"You must come back some day," she brightly returned.</p><p>"Some day? You mean as long a time hence as possible."</p><p>"Oh no; I don't mean all that."</p><p>"What do you mean? I don't understand! But I said I'd go, and I'll go," Goodwood added.</p><p>"Come back whenever you like," said Isabel with attempted lightness.</p><p>"I don't care a straw for your cousin!" Caspar broke out.</p><p>"Is that what you wished to tell me?"</p><p>"No, no; I didn't want to tell you anything; I wanted to ask you--"he paused a moment, and then--"what have you really made of your life?"he said, in a low, quick tone. He paused again, as if for an answer;but she said nothing, and he went on: "I can't understand, I can'tpenetrate you! What am I to believe-- what do you want me to think?"Still she said nothing; she only stood looking at him, now quitewithout pretending to ease. "I'm told you're unhappy, and if you are Ishould like to know it. That would be something for me. But youyourself say you're happy, and you're somehow so still, so smooth, sohard. You're completely changed. You conceal everything; I haven'treally come near you."</p><p>"You come very near," Isabel said gently, but in a tone of warning.</p><p>"And yet I don't touch you! I want to know the truth. Have you done well?"</p><p>"You ask a great deal."</p><p>"Yes--I've always asked a great deal. Of course you won't tell me. Ishall never know if you can help it. And then it's none of mybusiness." He had spoken with a visible effort to control himself, togive a considerate form to an inconsiderate state of mind. But thesense that it was his last chance, that he loved her and had lost her,that she would think him a fool whatever he should say, suddenly gavehim a lash and added a deep vibration to his low voice. "You'reperfectly inscrutable, and that's what makes me think you've somethingto hide. I tell you I don't care a straw for your cousin, but I don'tmean that I don't like him. I mean that it isn't because I like himthat I go away with him. I'd go if he were an idiot and you should haveasked me. If you should ask me I'd go to Siberia tomorrow. Why do youwant me to leave the place? You must have some reason for that; if youwere as contented as you pretend you are you wouldn't care. I'd ratherknow the truth about you, even if it's damnable, than have come herefor nothing. That isn't what I came for. I thought I shouldn't care. Icame because I wanted to assure myself that I needn't think of you anymore. I haven't thought of anything else, and you're quite right towish me to go away. But if I must go, there's no harm in my lettingmyself out for a single moment, is there? If you're really hurt--if HEhurts you--nothing I say will hurt you. When I tell you I love you it'ssimply what I came for. I thought it was for something else; but it wasfor that. I shouldn't say it if I didn't believe I should never see youagain. It's the last time--let me pluck a single flower! I've no rightto say that, I know; and you've no right to listen. But you don'tlisten; you never listen, you're always thinking of something else.After this I must go, of course; so I shall at least have a reason.Your asking me is no reason, not a real one. I can't judge by yourhusband," he went on irrelevantly, almost incoherently; "I don'tunderstand him; he tells me you adore each other. Why does he tell methat? What business is it of mine? When I say that to you, you lookstrange. But you always look strange. Yes, you've something to hide.It's none of my business --very true. But I love you," said CasparGoodwood.</p><p>As he said, she looked strange. She turned her eyes to the door by which they had entered and raised her fan as if in warning.</p><p>"You've behaved so well; don't spoil it," she uttered softly.</p><p>"No one hears me. It's wonderful what you tried to put me off with. I love you as I've never loved you."</p><p>"I know it. I knew it as soon as you consented to go."</p><p>"You can't help it--of course not. You would if you could, but youcan't, unfortunately. Unfortunately for me, I mean. I ask nothing--nothing, that is, I shouldn't. But I do ask one solesatisfaction:--that you tell me--that you tell me--!"</p><p>"That I tell you what?"</p><p>"Whether I may pity you."</p><p>"Should you like that?" Isabel asked, trying to smile again.</p><p>"To pity you? Most assuredly! That at least would be doing something. I'd give my life to it."</p><p>She raised her fan to her face, which it covered all except hereyes. They rested a moment on his. "Don't give your life to it; butgive a thought to it every now and then." And with that she went backto the Countess Gemini.</p></span><span id = 998 ><p>Madame Merle had not made her appearance at Palazzo Roccanera on theevening of that Thursday of which I have narrated some of theincidents, and Isabel, though she observed her absence, was notsurprised by it. Things had passed between them which added no stimulusto sociability, and to appreciate which we must glance a littlebackward. It has been mentioned that Madame Merle returned from Naplesshortly after Lord Warburton had left Rome, and that on her firstmeeting with Isabel (whom, to do her justice, she came immediately tosee) her first utterance had been an enquiry as to the whereabouts ofthis nobleman, for whom she appeared to hold her dear friendaccountable.</p><p>"Please don't talk of him," said Isabel for answer; "we've heard so much of him of late."</p><p>Madame Merle bent her head on one side a little, protestingly, andsmiled at the left corner of her mouth. "You've heard, yes. But youmust remember that I've not, in Naples. I hoped to find him here and tobe able to congratulate Pansy."</p><p>"You may congratulate Pansy still; but not on marrying Lord Warburton."</p><p>"How you say that! Don't you know I had set my heart on it?" MadameMerle asked with a great deal of spirit, but still with the intonationof good-humour.</p><p>Isabel was discomposed, but she was determined to be good-humouredtoo. "You shouldn't have gone to Naples then. You should have stayedhere to watch the affair."</p><p>"I had too much confidence in you. But do you think it's too late?"</p><p>"You had better ask Pansy," said Isabel.</p><p>"I shall ask her what you've said to her."</p><p>These words seemed to justify the impulse of self-defence aroused onIsabel's part by her perceiving that her visitor's attitude was acritical one. Madame Merle, as we know, had been very discreethitherto; she had never criticised; she had been markedly afraid ofintermeddling. But apparently she had only reserved herself for thisoccasion, since she now had a dangerous quickness in her eye and an airof irritation which even her admirable ease was not able to transmute.She had suffered a disappointment which excited Isabel's surprise--ourheroine having no knowledge of her zealous interest in Pansy'smarriage; and she betrayed it in a manner which quickened Mrs. Osmond'salarm. More clearly than ever before Isabel heard a cold, mocking voiceproceed from she knew not where, in the dim void that surrounded her,and declare that this bright, strong, definite, worldly woman, thisincarnation of the practical, the personal, the immediate, was apowerful agent in her destiny. She was nearer to her than Isabel hadyet discovered, and her nearness was not the charming accident she hadso long supposed. The sense of accident indeed had died within her thatday when she happened to be struck with the manner in which thewonderful lady and her own husband sat together in private. No definitesuspicion had as yet taken its place; but it was enough to make herview this friend with a different eye, to have been led to reflect thatthere was more intention in her past behaviour than she had allowed forat the time. Ah yes, there had been intention, there had beenintention, Isabel said to herself; and she seemed to wake from a longpernicious dream. What was it that brought home to her that MadameMerle's intention had not been good? Nothing but the mistrust which hadlately taken body and which married itself now to the fruitful wonderproduced by her visitor's challenge on behalf of poor Pansy. There wassomething in this challenge which had at the very outset excited ananswering defiance; a nameless vitality which she could see to havebeen absent from her friend's professions of delicacy and caution.Madame Merle had been unwilling to interfere, certainly, but only solong as there was nothing to interfere with. It will perhaps seem tothe reader that Isabel went fast in casting doubt, on mere suspicion,on a sincerity proved by several years of good offices. She movedquickly indeed, and with reason, for a strange truth was filtering intoher soul. Madame Merle's interest was identical with Osmond's: that wasenough. "I think Pansy will tell you nothing that will make you moreangry," she said in answer to her companion's last remark.</p><p>"I'm not in the least angry. I've only a great desire to retrievethe situation. Do you consider that Warburton has left us for ever?"</p><p>"I can't tell you; I don't understand you. It's all over; please letit rest. Osmond has talked to me a great deal about it, and I'venothing more to say or to hear. I've no doubt," Isabel added, "thathe'll be very happy to discuss the subject with you."</p><p>"I know what he thinks; he came to see me last evening."</p><p>"As soon as you had arrived? Then you know all about it and you needn't apply to me for information."</p><p>"It isn't information I want. At bottom it's sympathy. I had set myheart on that marriage; the idea did what so few things do-- itsatisfied the imagination."</p><p>"Your imagination, yes. But not that of the persons concerned."</p><p>"You mean by that of course that I'm not concerned. Of course notdirectly. But when one's such an old friend one can't help havingsomething at stake. You forget how long I've known Pansy. You mean, ofcourse," Madame Merle added, "that YOU are one of the personsconcerned."</p><p>"No; that's the last thing I mean. I'm very weary of it all."</p><p>Madame Merle hesitated a little. "Ah yes, your work's done."</p><p>"Take care what you say," said Isabel very gravely.</p><p>"Oh, I take care; never perhaps more than when it appears least. Your husband judges you severely."</p><p>Isabel made for a moment no answer to this; she felt choked withbitterness. It was not the insolence of Madame Merle's informing herthat Osmond had been taking her into his confidence as against his wifethat struck her most; for she was not quick to believe that this wasmeant for insolence. Madame Merle was very rarely insolent, and onlywhen it was exactly right. It was not right now, or at least it was notright yet. What touched Isabel like a drop of corrosive acid upon anopen wound was the knowledge that Osmond dishonoured her in his wordsas well as in his thoughts. "Should you like to know how I judge HIM?"she asked at last.</p><p>"No, because you'd never tell me. And it would be painful for me to know."</p><p>There was a pause, and for the first time since she had known herIsabel thought Madame Merle disagreeable. She wished she would leaveher. "Remember how attractive Pansy is, and don't despair," she saidabruptly, with a desire that this should close their interview.</p><p>But Madame Merle's expansive presence underwent no contraction. Sheonly gathered her mantle about her and, with the movement, scatteredupon the air a faint, agreeable fragrance. "I don't despair; I feelencouraged. And I didn't come to scold you; I came if possible to learnthe truth. I know you'll tell it if I ask you. It's an immense blessingwith you that one can count upon that. No, you won't believe what acomfort I take in it."</p><p>"What truth do you speak of?" Isabel asked, wondering.</p><p>"Just this: whether Lord Warburton changed his mind quite of his ownmovement or because you recommended it. To please himself I mean, or toplease you. Think of the confidence I must still have in you, in spiteof having lost a little of it," Madame Merle continued with a smile,"to ask such a question as that!" She sat looking at her friend, tojudge the effect of her words, and then went on: "Now don't be heroic,don't be unreasonable, don't take offence. It seems to me I do you anhonour in speaking so. I don't know another woman to whom I would doit. I haven't the least idea that any other woman would tell me thetruth. And don't you see how well it is that your husband should knowit? It's true that he doesn't appear to have had any tact whatever intrying to extract it; he has indulged in gratuitous suppositions. Butthat doesn't alter the fact that it would make a difference in his viewof his daughter's prospects to know distinctly what really occurred. IfLord Warburton simply got tired of the poor child, that's one thing,and it's a pity. If he gave her up to please you it's another. That's apity too, but in a different way. Then, in the latter case, you'dperhaps resign yourself to not being pleased--to simply seeing yourstep-daughter married. Let him off--let us have him!"</p><p>Madame Merle had proceeded very deliberately, watching her companionand apparently thinking she could proceed safely. As she went on Isabelgrew pale; she clasped her hands more tightly in her lap. It was notthat her visitor had at last thought it the right time to be insolent;for this was not what was most apparent. It was a worse horror thanthat. "Who are you--what are you?" Isabel murmured. "What have you todo with my husband?" It was strange that for the moment she drew asnear to him as if she had loved him.</p><p>"Ah then, you take it heroically! I'm very sorry. Don't think, however, that I shall do so."</p><p>"What have you to do with me?" Isabel went on.</p><p>Madame Merle slowly got up, stroking her muff, but not removing her eyes from Isabel's face. "Everything!" she answered.</p><p>Isabel sat there looking up at her, without rising; her face wasalmost a prayer to be enlightened. But the light of this woman's eyesseemed only a darkness. "Oh misery!" she murmured at last; and she fellback, covering her face with her hands. It had come over her like ahigh-surging wave that Mrs. Touchett was right. Madame Merle hadmarried her. Before she uncovered her face again that lady had left theroom.</p><p>Isabel took a drive alone that afternoon; she wished to be far away,under the sky, where she could descend from her carriage and tread uponthe daisies. She had long before this taken old Rome into herconfidence, for in a world of ruins the ruin of her happiness seemed aless unnatural catastrophe. She rested her weariness upon things thathad crumbled for centuries and yet still were upright; she dropped hersecret sadness into the silence of lonely places, where its very modernquality detached itself and grew objective, so that as she sat in asun-warmed angle on a winter's day, or stood in a mouldy church towhich no one came, she could almost smile at it and think of itssmallness. Small it was, in the large Roman record, and her hauntingsense of the continuity of the human lot easily carried her from theless to the greater. She had become deeply, tenderly acquainted withRome; it interfused and moderated her passion. But she had grown tothink of it chiefly as the place where people had suffered. This waswhat came to her in the starved churches, where the marble columns,transferred from pagan ruins, seemed to offer her a companionship inendurance and the musty incense to be a compound of long-unansweredprayers. There was no gentler nor less consistent heretic than Isabel;the firmest of worshippers, gazing at dark altar-pictures or clusteredcandles, could not have felt more intimately the suggestiveness ofthese objects nor have been more liable at such moments to a spiritualvisitation. Pansy, as we know, was almost always her companion, and oflate the Countess Gemini, balancing a pink parasol, had lent brilliancyto their equipage; but she still occasionally found herself alone whenit suited her mood and where it suited the place. On such occasions shehad several resorts; the most accessible of which perhaps was a seat onthe low parapet which edges the wide grassy space before the high, coldfront of Saint John Lateran, whence you look across the Campagna at thefar-trailing outline of the Alban Mount and at that mighty plain,between, which is still so full of all that has passed from it. Afterthe departure of her cousin and his companions she roamed more thanusual; she carried her sombre spirit from one familiar shrine to theother. Even when Pansy and the Countess were with her she felt thetouch of a vanished world. The carriage, leaving the walls of Romebehind, rolled through narrow lanes where the wild honeysuckle hadbegun to tangle itself in the hedges, or waited for her in quiet placeswhere the fields lay near, while she strolled further and further overthe flower-freckled turf, or sat on a stone that had once had a use andgazed through the veil of her personal sadness at the splendid sadnessof the scene--at the dense, warm light, the far gradations and softconfusions of colour, the motionless shepherds in lonely attitudes, thehills where the cloud-shadows had the lightness of a blush.</p><p>On the afternoon I began with speaking of, she had taken aresolution not to think of Madame Merle; but the resolution provedvain, and this lady's image hovered constantly before her. She askedherself, with an almost childlike horror of the supposition, whether tothis intimate friend of several years the great historical epithet ofwicked were to be applied. She knew the idea only by the Bible andother literary works; to the best of her belief she had had no personalacquaintance with wickedness. She had desired a large acquaintance withhuman life, and in spite of her having flattered herself that shecultivated it with some success this elementary privilege had beendenied her. Perhaps it was not wicked--in the historic sense--to beeven deeply false; for that was what Madame Merle had been--deeply,deeply, deeply. Isabel's Aunt Lydia had made this discovery longbefore, and had mentioned it to her niece; but Isabel had flatteredherself at this time that she had a much richer view of things,especially of the spontaneity of her own career and the nobleness ofher own interpretations, than poor stiffly-reasoning Mrs. Touchett.Madame Merle had done what she wanted; she had brought about the unionof her two friends; a reflection which could not fail to make it amatter of wonder that she should so much have desired such an event.There were people who had the match-making passion, like the votariesof art for art; but Madame Merle, great artist as she was, was scarcelyone of these. She thought too ill of marriage, too ill even of life;she had desired that particular marriage but had not desired others.She had therefore had a conception of gain, and Isabel asked herselfwhere she had found her profit. It took her naturally a long time todiscover, and even then her discovery was imperfect. It came back toher that Madame Merle, though she had seemed to like her from theirfirst meeting at Gardencourt, had been doubly affectionate after Mr.Touchett's death and after learning that her young friend had beensubject to the good old man's charity. She had found her profit not inthe gross device of borrowing money, but in the more refined idea ofintroducing one of her intimates to the young woman's fresh andingenuous fortune. She had naturally chosen her closest intimate, andit was already vivid enough to Isabel that Gilbert occupied thisposition. She found herself confronted in this manner with theconviction that the man in the world whom she had supposed to be theleast sordid had married her, like a vulgar adventurer, for her money.Strange to say, it had never before occurred to her; if she had thoughta good deal of harm of Osmond she had not done him this particularinjury. This was the worst she could think of, and she had been sayingto herself that the worst was still to come. A man might marry a womanfor her money perfectly well; the thing was often done. But at least heshould let her know. She wondered whether, since he had wanted hermoney, her money would now satisfy him. Would he take her money and lether go Ah, if Mr. Touchett's great charity would but help her to-day itwould be blessed indeed! It was not slow to occur to her that if MadameMerle had wished to do Gilbert a service his recognition to her of theboon must have lost its warmth. What must be his feelings to-day inregard to his too zealous benefactress, and what expression must theyhave found on the part of such a master of irony? It is a singular, buta characteristic, fact that before Isabel returned from her silentdrive she had broken its silence by the soft exclamation: "Poor, poorMadame Merle!"</p><p>Her compassion would perhaps have been justified if on this sameafternoon she had been concealed behind one of the valuable curtains oftime-softened damask which dressed the interesting little salon of thelady to whom it referred; the carefully-arranged apartment to which weonce paid a visit in company with the discreet Mr. Rosier. In thatapartment, towards six o'clock, Gilbert Osmond was seated, and hishostess stood before him as Isabel had seen her stand on an occasioncommemorated in this history with an emphasis appropriate not so muchto its apparent as to its real importance.</p><p>"I don't believe you're unhappy; I believe you like it," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"Did I say I was unhappy?" Osmond asked with a face grave enough to suggest that he might have been.</p><p>"No, but you don't say the contrary, as you ought in common gratitude."</p><p>"Don't talk about gratitude," he returned dryly. "And don't aggravate me," he added in a moment.</p><p>Madame Merle slowly seated herself, with her arms folded and herwhite hands arranged as a support to one of them and an ornament, as itwere, to the other. She looked exquisitely calm but impressively sad."On your side, don't try to frighten me. I wonder if you guess some ofmy thoughts."</p><p>"I trouble about them no more than I can help. I've quite enough of my own."</p><p>"That's because they're so delightful."</p><p>Osmond rested his head against the back of his chair and looked athis companion with a cynical directness which seemed also partly anexpression of fatigue. "You do aggravate me," he remarked in a moment."I'm very tired."</p><p>"Eh moi donc!" cried Madame Merle.</p><p>"With you it's because you fatigue yourself. With me it's not my own fault."</p><p>"When I fatigue myself it's for you. I've given you an interest. That's a great gift."</p><p>"Do you call it an interest?" Osmond enquired with detachment.</p><p>"Certainly, since it helps you to pass your time."</p><p>"The time has never seemed longer to me than this winter."</p><p>"You've never looked better; you've never been so agreeable, so brilliant."</p><p>"Damn my brilliancy!" he thoughtfully murmured. "How little, after all, you know me!"</p><p>"If I don't know you I know nothing," smiled Madame Merle. "You've the feeling of complete success."</p><p>"No, I shall not have that till I've made you stop judging me."</p><p>"I did that long ago. I speak from old knowledge. But you express yourself more too."</p><p>Osmond just hung fire. "I wish you'd express yourself less!"</p><p>"You wish to condemn me to silence? Remember that I've never been achatterbox. At any rate there are three or four things I should like tosay to you first. Your wife doesn't know what to do with herself," shewent on with a change of tone.</p><p>"Pardon me; she knows perfectly. She has a line sharply drawn. She means to carry out her ideas."</p><p>"Her ideas to-day must be remarkable."</p><p>"Certainly they are. She has more of them than ever."</p><p>"She was unable to show me any this morning," said Madame Merle."She seemed in a very simple, almost in a stupid, state of mind. Shewas completely bewildered."</p><p>"You had better say at once that she was pathetic."</p><p>"Ah no, I don't want to encourage you too much."</p><p>He still had his head against the cushion behind him; the ankle ofone foot rested on the other knee. So he sat for a while. "I shouldlike to know what's the matter with you," he said at last.</p><p>"The matter--the matter--!" And here Madame Merle stopped. Then shewent on with a sudden outbreak of passion, a burst of summer thunder ina clear sky: "The matter is that I would give my right hand to be ableto weep, and that I can't!"</p><p>"What good would it do you to weep?"</p><p>"It would make me feel as I felt before I knew you."</p><p>"If I've dried your tears, that's something. But I've seen you shed them."</p><p>"Oh, I believe you'll make me cry still. I mean make me howl like awolf. I've a great hope, I've a great need, of that. I was vile thismorning; I was horrid," she said.</p><p>"If Isabel was in the stupid state of mind you mention she probably didn't perceive it," Osmond answered.</p><p>"It was precisely my deviltry that stupefied her. I couldn't helpit; I was full of something bad. Perhaps it was something good; I don'tknow. You've not only dried up my tears; you've dried up my soul."</p><p>"It's not I then that am responsible for my wife's condition,"Osmond said. "It's pleasant to think that I shall get the benefit ofyour influence upon her. Don't you know the soul is an immortalprinciple? How can it suffer alteration?"</p><p>"I don't believe at all that it's an immortal principle. I believeit can perfectly be destroyed. That's what has happened to mine, whichwas a very good one to start with; and it's you I have to thank for it.You're VERY bad," she added with gravity in her emphasis.</p><p>"Is this the way we're to end?" Osmond asked with the same studied coldness.</p><p>"I don't know how we're to end. I wish I did--How do bad peopleend?--especially as to their COMMON crimes. You have made me as bad asyourself."</p><p>"I don't understand you. You seem to me quite good enough," saidOsmond, his conscious indifference giving an extreme effect to thewords.</p><p>Madame Merle's self-possession tended on the contrary to diminish,and she was nearer losing it than on any occasion on which we have hadthe pleasure of meeting her. The glow of her eye turners sombre; hersmile betrayed a painful effort. "Good enough for anything that I'vedone with myself? I suppose that's what you mean."</p><p>"Good enough to be always charming!" Osmond exclaimed, smiling too.</p><p>"Oh God!" his companion murmured; and, sitting there in her ripefreshness, she had recourse to the same gesture she had provoked onIsabel's part in the morning: she bent her face and covered it with herhands.</p><p>"Are you going to weep after all?" Osmond asked; and on her remaining motionless he went on: "Have I ever complained to you?"</p><p>She dropped her hands quickly. "No, you've taken your revenge otherwise--you have taken it on HER."</p><p>Osmond threw back his head further; he looked a while at the ceilingand might have been supposed to be appealing, in an informal way, tothe heavenly powers. "Oh, the imagination of women! It's always vulgar,at bottom. You talk of revenge like a third-rate novelist."</p><p>"Of course you haven't complained. You've enjoyed your triumph too much."</p><p>"I'm rather curious to know what you call my triumph."</p><p>"You've made your wife afraid of you."</p><p>Osmond changed his position; he leaned forward, resting his elbowson his knees and looking a while at a beautiful old Persian rug, at hisfeet. He had an air of refusing to accept any one's valuation ofanything, even of time, and of preferring to abide by his own; apeculiarity which made him at moments an irritating person to conversewith. "Isabel's not afraid of me, and it's not what I wish," he said atlast. "To what do you want to provoke me when you say such things asthat?"</p><p>"I've thought over all the harm you can do me," Madame Merleanswered. "Your wife was afraid of me this morning, but in me it wasreally you she feared."</p><p>"You may have said things that were in very bad taste; I'm notresponsible for that. I didn't see the use of your going to see her atall: you're capable of acting without her. I've not made you afraid ofme that I can see," he went on; "how then should I have made her?You're at least as brave. I can't think where you've picked up suchrubbish; one might suppose you knew me by this time." He got up as hespoke and walked to the chimney, where he stood a moment bending hiseye, as if he had seen them for the first time, on the delicatespecimens of rare porcelain with which it was covered. He took up asmall cup and held it in his hand; then, still holding it and leaninghis arm on the mantel, he pursued: "You always see too much inseverything; you overdo it; you lose sight of the real. I'm much simplerthan you think."</p><p>"I think you're very simple." And Madame Merle kept her eye on hercup. "I've come to that with time. I judged you, as I say, of old; butit's only since your marriage that I've understood you. I've seenbetter what you have been to your wife than I ever saw what you werefor me. Please be very careful of that precious object."</p><p>"It already has a wee bit of a tiny crack," said Osmond dryly as heput it down. "If you didn't understand me before I married it wascruelly rash of you to put me into such a box. However, I took a fancyto my box myself; I thought it would be a comfortable fit. I asked verylittle; I only asked that she should like me."</p><p>"That she should like you so much!"</p><p>"So much, of course; in such a case one asks the maximum. That she should adore me, if you will. Oh yes, I wanted that."</p><p>"I never adored you," said Madame Merle.</p><p>"Ah, but you pretended to!"</p><p>"It's true that you never accused me of being a comfortable fit," Madame Merle went on.</p><p>"My wife has declined--declined to do anything of the sort," saidOsmond. "If you're determined to make a tragedy of that, the tragedy'shardly for her."</p><p>"The tragedy's for me!" Madame Merle exclaimed, rising with a longlow sigh but having a glance at the same time for the contents of hermantel-shelf.</p><p>"It appears that I'm to be severely taught the disadvantages of a false position."</p><p>"You express yourself like a sentence in a copybook. We must lookfor our comfort where we can find it. If my wife doesn't like me, atleast my child does. I shall look for compensations in Pansy.Fortunately I haven't a fault to find with her."</p><p>"Ah," she said softly, "if I had a child--!"</p><p>Osmond waited, and then, with a little formal air, "The children of others may be a great interest!" he announced.</p><p>"You're more like a copy-book than I. There's something after all that holds us together."</p><p>"Is it the idea of the harm I may do you?" Osmond asked.</p><p>"No; it's the idea of the good I may do for you. It's that," MadameMerle pursued, "that made me so jealous of Isabel. I want it to be MYwork," she added, with her face, which had grown hard and bitter,relaxing to its habit of smoothness.</p><p>Her friend took up his hat and his umbrella, and after giving theformer article two or three strokes with his coat-cuff, "On the whole,I think," he said, "you had better leave it to me."</p><p>After he had left her she went, the first thing, and lifted from themantel-shelf the attenuated coffee-cup in which he had mentioned theexistence of a crack; but she looked at it rather abstractedly. "Have Ibeen so vile all for nothing?" she vaguely wailed.</p></span><span id = 999 ><p>As the Countess Gemini was not acquainted with the ancient monumentsIsabel occasionally offered to introduce her to these interestingrelics and to give their afternoon drive an antiquarian aim. TheCountess, who professed to think her sister-in-law a prodigy oflearning, never made an objection, and gazed at masses of Romanbrickwork as patiently as if they had been mounds of modern drapery.She had not the historic sense, though she had in some directions theanecdotic, and as regards herself the apologetic, but she was sodelighted to be in Rome that she only desired to float with thecurrent. She would gladly have passed an hour every day in the dampdarkness of the Baths of Titus if it had been a condition of herremaining at Palazzo Roccanera. Isabel, however, was not a severecicerone; she used to visit the ruins chiefly because they offered anexcuse for talking about other matters than the love affairs of theladies of Florence, as to which her companion was never weary ofoffering information. It must be added that during these visits theCountess forbade herself every form of active research; her preferencewas to sit in the carriage and exclaim that everything was mostinteresting. It was in this manner that she had hitherto examined theColiseum, to the infinite regret of her niece, who-- with all therespect that she owed her--could not see why she should not descendfrom the vehicle and enter the building. Pansy had so little chance toramble that her view of the case was not wholly disinterested; it maybe divined that she had a secret hope that, once inside, her parents'guest might be induced to climb to the upper tiers. There came a daywhen the Countess announced her willingness to undertake this feat--amild afternoon in March when the windy month expressed itself inoccasional puffs of spring. The three ladies went into the Coliseumtogether, but Isabel left her companions to wander over the place. Shehad often ascended to those desolate ledges from which the Roman crowdused to bellow applause and where now the wild flowers (when they areallowed) bloom in the deep crevices; and to-day she felt weary anddisposed to sit in the despoiled arena. It made an intermission too,for the Countess often asked more from one's attention than she gave inreturn; and Isabel believed that when she was alone with her niece shelet the dust gather for a moment on the ancient scandals of the Arnide.She so remained below therefore, while Pansy guided herundiscriminating aunt to the steep brick staircase at the foot of whichthe custodian unlocks the tall wooden gate. The great enclosure washalf in shadow; the western sun brought out the pale red tone of thegreat blocks of travertine--the latent colour that is the only livingelement in the immense ruin. Here and there wandered a peasant or atourist, looking up at the far sky-line where, in the clear stillness,a multitude of swallows kept circling and plunging. Isabel presentlybecame aware that one of the other visitors, planted in the middle ofthe arena, had turned his attention to her own person and was lookingat her with a certain little poise of the head which she had some weeksbefore perceived to be characteristic of baffled but indestructiblepurpose. Such an attitude, to-day, could belong only to Mr. EdwardRosier; and this gentleman proved in fact to have been considering thequestion of speaking to her. When he had assured himself that she wasunaccompanied he drew near, remarking that though she would not answerhis letters she would perhaps not wholly close her ears to his spokeneloquence. She replied that her stepdaughter was close at hand and thatshe could only give him five minutes; whereupon he took out his watchand sat down upon a broken block.</p><p>"It's very soon told," said Edward Rosier. "I've sold all mybibelots!" Isabel gave instinctively an exclamation of horror; it wasas if he had told her he had had all his teeth drawn. "I've sold themby auction at the Hotel Drouot," he went on. "The sale took place threedays ago, and they've telegraphed me the result. It's magnificent."</p><p>"I'm glad to hear it; but I wish you had kept your pretty things."</p><p>"I have the money instead--fifty thousand dollars. Will Mr. Osmond think me rich enough now?"</p><p>"Is it for that you did it?" Isabel asked gently.</p><p>"For what else in the world could it be? That's the only thing Ithink of. I went to Paris and made my arrangements. I couldn't stop forthe sale; I couldn't have seen them going off; I think it would havekilled me. But I put them into good hands, and they brought highprices. I should tell you I have kept my enamels. Now I have the moneyin my pocket, and he can't say I'm poor!" the young man exclaimeddefiantly.</p><p>"He'll say now that you're not wise," said Isabel, as if Gilbert Osmond had never said this before.</p><p>Rosier gave her a sharp look. "Do you mean that without my bibelotsI'm nothing? Do you mean they were the best thing about me? That's whatthey told me in Paris; oh they were very frank about it. But theyhadn't seen HER!"</p><p>"My dear friend, you deserve to succeed," said Isabel very kindly.</p><p>"You say that so sadly that it's the same as if you said Ishouldn't." And he questioned her eyes with the clear trepidation ofhis own. He had the air of a man who knows he has been the talk ofParis for a week and is full half a head taller in consequence, but whoalso has a painful suspicion that in spite of this increase of statureone or two persons still have the perversity to think him diminutive."I know what happened here while I was away," he went on; "What doesMr. Osmond expect after she has refused Lord Warburton?"</p><p>Isabel debated. "That she'll marry another nobleman."</p><p>"What other nobleman?"</p><p>"One that he'll pick out."</p><p>Rosier slowly got up, putting his watch into his waistcoat-pocket."You're laughing at some one, but this time I don't think it's at me."</p><p>"I didn't mean to laugh," said Isabel. "I laugh very seldom. Now you had better go away."</p><p>"I feel very safe!" Rosier declared without moving. This might be;but it evidently made him feel more so to make the announcement inrather a loud voice, balancing himself a little complacently on histoes and looking all round the Coliseum as if it were filled with anaudience. Suddenly Isabel saw him change colour; there was more of anaudience than he had suspected. She turned and perceived that her twocompanions had returned from their excursion. "You must really goaway," she said quickly. "Ah, my dear lady, pity me!" Edward Rosiermurmured in a voice strangely at variance with the announcement I havejust quoted. And then he added eagerly, like a man who in the midst ofhis misery is seized by a happy thought: "Is that lady the CountessGemini? I've a great desire to be presented to her."</p><p>Isabel looked at him a moment. "She has no influence with her brother."</p><p>"Ah, what a monster you make him out!" And Rosier faced theCountess, who advanced, in front of Pansy, with an animation partly dueperhaps to the fact that she perceived her sister-in-law to be engagedin conversation with a very pretty young man.</p><p>"I'm glad you've kept your enamels!" Isabel called as she left him.She went straight to Pansy, who, on seeing Edward Rosier, had stoppedshort, with lowered eyes. "We'll go back to the carriage," she saidgently.</p><p>"Yes, it's getting late," Pansy returned more gently still. And shewent on without a murmur, without faltering or glancing back. Isabel,however, allowing herself this last liberty, saw that a meeting hadimmediately taken place between the Countess and Mr. Rosier. He hadremoved his hat and was bowing and smiling; he had evidently introducedhimself, while the Countess's expressive back displayed to Isabel's eyea gracious inclination. These facts, none the less, were presently lostto sight, for Isabel and Pansy took their places again in the carriage.Pansy, who faced her stepmother, at first kept her eyes fixed on herlap; then she raised them and rested them on Isabel's. There shone outof each of them a little melancholy ray--a spark of timid passion whichtouched Isabel to the heart. At the same time a wave of envy passedover her soul, as she compared the tremulous longing, the definiteideal of the child with her own dry despair. "Poor little Pansy!" sheaffectionately said.</p><p>"Oh never mind!" Pansy answered in the tone of eager apology. Andthen there was a silence; the Countess was a long time coming. "Did youshow your aunt everything, and did she enjoy it?" Isabel asked at last.</p><p>"Yes, I showed her everything. I think she was very much pleased."</p><p>"And you're not tired, I hope."</p><p>"Oh no, thank you, I'm not tired."</p><p>The Countess still remained behind, so that Isabel requested thefootman to go into the Coliseum and tell her they were waiting. Hepresently returned with the announcement that the Signora Contessabegged them not to wait--she would come home in a cab!</p><p>About a week after this lady's quick sympathies had enlistedthemselves with Mr. Rosier, Isabel, going rather late to dress fordinner, found Pansy sitting in her room. The girl seemed to have beenawaiting her; she got up from her low chair. "Pardon my taking theliberty," she said in a small voice. "It will be the last--for sometime."</p><p>Her voice was strange, and her eyes, widely opened, had an excited, frightened look. "You're not going away!" Isabel exclaimed.</p><p>"I'm going to the convent."</p><p>"To the convent?"</p><p>Pansy drew nearer, till she was near enough to put her arms roundIsabel and rest her head on her shoulder. She stood this way a moment,perfectly still; but her companion could feel her tremble. The quiverof her little body expressed everything she was unable to say. Isabelnevertheless pressed her. "Why are you going to the convent?"</p><p>"Because papa thinks it best. He says a young girl's better, everynow and then, for making a little retreat. He says the world, alwaysthe world, is very bad for a young girl. This is just a chance for alittle seclusion--a little reflexion." Pansy spoke in short detachedsentences, as if she could scarce trust herself; and then she addedwith a triumph of self-control: "I think papa's right; I've been somuch in the world this winter."</p><p>Her announcement had a strange effect on Isabel; it seemed to carrya larger meaning than the girl herself knew. "When was this decided?"she asked. "I've heard nothing of it."</p><p>"Papa told me half an hour ago; he thought it better it shouldn't betoo much talked about in advance. Madame Catherine's to come for me ata quarter past seven, and I'm only to take two frocks. It's only for afew weeks; I'm sure it will be very good. I shall find all those ladieswho used to be so kind to me, and I shall see the little girls who arebeing educated. I'm very fond of little girls," said Pansy with aneffect of diminutive grandeur. "And I'm also very fond of MotherCatherine. I shall be very quiet and think a great deal."</p><p>Isabel listened to her, holding her breath; she was almost awe-struck. "Think of ME sometimes."</p><p>"Ah, come and see me soon!" cried Pansy; and the cry was verydifferent from the heroic remarks of which she had just deliveredherself.</p><p>Isabel could say nothing more; she understood nothing; she only felthow little she yet knew her husband. Her answer to his daughter was along, tender kiss.</p><p>Half an hour later she learned from her maid that Madame Catherinehad arrived in a cab and had departed again with the signorina. Ongoing to the drawing-room before dinner she found the Countess Geminialone, and this lady characterised the incident by exclaiming, with awonderful toss of the head, "En voila, ma chere, une pose!" But if itwas an affectation she was at a loss to see what her husband affected.She could only dimly perceive that he had more traditions than shesupposed. It had become her habit to be so careful as to what she saidto him that, strange as it may appear, she hesitated, for severalminutes after he had come in, to allude to his daughter's suddendeparture: she spoke of it only after they were seated at table. Butshe had forbidden herself ever to ask Osmond a question. All she coulddo was to make a declaration, and there was one that came verynaturally. "I shall miss Pansy very much."</p><p>He looked a while, with his head inclined a little, at the basket offlowers in the middle of the table. "Ah yes," he said at last, "I hadthought of that. You must go and see her, you know; but not too often.I dare say you wonder why I sent her to the good sisters; but I doubtif I can make you understand. It doesn't matter; don't trouble yourselfabout it. That's why I had not spoken of it. I didn't believe you wouldenter into it. But I've always had the idea; I've always thought it apart of the education of one's daughter. One's daughter should be freshand fair; she should be innocent and gentle. With the manners of thepresent time she is liable to become so dusty and crumpled. Pansy's alittle dusty, a little dishevelled; she has knocked about too much.This bustling, pushing rabble that calls itself society--one shouldtake her out of it occasionally. Convents are very quiet, veryconvenient, very salutary. I like to think of her there, in the oldgarden, under the arcade, among those tranquil virtuous women. Many ofthem are gentlewomen born; several of them are noble. She will have herbooks and her drawing, she will have her piano. I've made the mostliberal arrangements. There is to be nothing ascetic; there's just tobe a certain little sense of sequestration. She'll have time to think,and there's something I want her to think about." Osmond spokedeliberately, reasonably, still with his head on one side, as if hewere looking at the basket of flowers. His tone, however, was that of aman not so much offering an explanation as putting a thing intowords--almost into pictures--to see, himself, how it would look. Heconsidered a while the picture he had evoked and seemed greatly pleasedwith it. And then he went on: "The Catholics are very wise after all.The convent is a great institution; we can't do without it; itcorresponds to an essential need in families, in society. It's a schoolof good manners; it's a school of repose. Oh, I don't want to detach mydaughter from the world," he added; "I don't want to make her fix herthoughts on any other. This one's very well, as SHE should take it, andshe may think of it as much as she likes. Only she must think of it inthe right way."</p><p>Isabel gave an extreme attention to this little sketch; she found itindeed intensely interesting. It seemed to show her how far herhusband's desire to be effective was capable of going--to the point ofplaying theoretic tricks on the delicate organism of his daughter. Shecould not understand his purpose, no--not wholly; but she understood itbetter than he supposed or desired, inasmuch as she was convinced thatthe whole proceeding was an elaborate mystification, addressed toherself and destined to act upon her imagination. He had wanted to dosomething sudden and arbitrary, something unexpected and refined; tomark the difference between his sympathies and her own, and show thatif he regarded his daughter as a precious work of art it was natural heshould be more and more careful about the finishing touches. If hewished to be effective he had succeeded; the incident struck a chillinto Isabel's heart. Pansy had known the convent in her childhood andhad found a happy home there; she was fond of the good sisters, whowere very fond of her, and there was therefore for the moment nodefinite hardship in her lot. But all the same the girl had takenfright; the impression her father desired to make would evidently besharp enough. The old Protestant tradition had never faded fromIsabel's imagination, and as her thoughts attached themselves to thisstriking example of her husband's genius--she sat looking, like him, atthe basket of flowers--poor little Pansy became the heroine of atragedy. Osmond wished it to be known that he shrank from nothing, andhis wife found it hard to pretend to eat her dinner. There was acertain relief presently, in hearing the high, strained voice of hersister-in-law. The Countess too, apparently, had been thinking thething out, but had arrived at a different conclusion from Isabel.</p><p>"It's very absurd, my dear Osmond," she said, "to invent so manypretty reasons for poor Pansy's banishment. Why, don't you say at oncethat you want to get her out of my way? Haven't you discovered that Ithink very well of Mr. Rosier? I do indeed; he seems to mesimpaticissimo. He has made me believe in true love; I never didbefore! Of course you've made up your mind that with those convictionsI'm dreadful company for Pansy."</p><p>Osmond took a sip of a glass of wine; he looked perfectlygood-humoured. "My dear Amy," he answered, smiling as if he wereuttering a piece of gallantry, "I don't know anything about yourconvictions, but if I suspected that they interfere with mine it wouldbe much simpler to banish YOU."</p></span><span id = 1000 ><p>The Countess was not banished, but she felt the insecurity of hertenure of her brother's hospitality. A week after this incident Isabelreceived a telegram from England, dated from Gardencourt and bearingthe stamp of Mrs. Touchett's authorship. "Ralph cannot last many days,"it ran, "and if convenient would like to see you. Wishes me to say thatyou must come only if you've not other duties. Say, for myself, thatyou used to talk a good deal about your duty and to wonder what it was;shall be curious to see whether you've found it out. Ralph is reallydying, and there's no other company." Isabel was prepared for thisnews, having received from Henrietta Stackpole a detailed account ofher journey to England with her appreciative patient. Ralph had arrivedmore dead than alive, but she had managed to convey him to Gardencourt,where he had taken to his bed, which, as Miss Stackpole wrote, heevidently would never leave again. She added that she had really hadtwo patients on her hands instead of one, inasmuch as Mr. Goodwood, whohad been of no earthly use, was quite as ailing, in a different way, asMr. Touchett. Afterwards she wrote that she had been obliged tosurrender the field to Mrs. Touchett, who had just returned fromAmerica and had promptly given her to understand that she didn't wishany interviewing at Gardencourt. Isabel had written to her aunt shortlyafter Ralph came to Rome, letting her know of his critical conditionand suggesting that she should lose no time in returning to Europe.Mrs. Touchett had telegraphed an acknowledgement of this admonition,and the only further news Isabel received from her was the secondtelegram I have just quoted.</p><p>Isabel stood a moment looking at the latter missive; then, thrustingit into her pocket, she went straight to the door of her husband'sstudy. Here she again paused an instant, after which she opened thedoor and went in. Osmond was seated at the table near the window with afolio volume before him, propped against a pile of books. This volumewas open at a page of small coloured plates, and Isabel presently sawthat he had been copying from it the drawing of an antique coin. A boxof water-colours and fine brushes lay before him, and he had alreadytransferred to a sheet of immaculate paper the delicate, finely-tinteddisk. His back was turned toward the door, but he recognised his wifewithout looking round.</p><p>"Excuse me for disturbing you," she said.</p><p>"When I come to your room I always knock," he answered, going on with his work.</p><p>"I forgot; I had something else to think of. My cousin's dying."</p><p>"Ah, I don't believe that," said Osmond, looking at his drawingthrough a magnifying glass. "He was dying when we married; he'lloutlive us all."</p><p>Isabel gave herself no time, no thought, to appreciate the carefulcynicism of this declaration; she simply went on quickly, full of herown intention "My aunt has telegraphed for me; I must go toGardencourt."</p><p>"Why must you go to Gardencourt?" Osmond asked in the tone of impartial curiosity.</p><p>"To see Ralph before he dies."</p><p>To this, for some time, he made no rejoinder; he continued to givehis chief attention to his work, which was of a sort that would brookno negligence. "I don't see the need of it," he said at last. "He cameto see you here. I didn't like that; I thought his being in Rome agreat mistake. But I tolerated it because it was to be the last timeyou should see him. Now you tell me it's not to have been the last. Ah,you're not grateful!"</p><p>"What am I to be grateful for?"</p><p>Gilbert Osmond laid down his little implements, blew a speck of dustfrom his drawing, slowly got up, and for the first time looked at hiswife. "For my not having interfered while he was here."</p><p>"Oh yes, I am. I remember perfectly how distinctly you let me know you didn't like it. I was very glad when he went away."</p><p>"Leave him alone then. Don't run after him."</p><p>Isabel turned her eyes away from him; they rested upon his littledrawing. "I must go to England," she said, with a full consciousnessthat her tone might strike an irritable man of taste as stupidlyobstinate.</p><p>"I shall not like it if you do," Osmond remarked.</p><p>"Why should I mind that? You won't like it if I don't. You like nothing I do or don't do. You pretend to think I lie."</p><p>Osmond turned slightly pale; he gave a cold smile. "That's why youmust go then? Not to see your cousin, but to take a revenge on me."</p><p>"I know nothing about revenge."</p><p>"I do," said Osmond. "Don't give me an occasion."</p><p>"You're only too eager to take one. You wish immensely that I would commit some folly."</p><p>"I should be gratified in that case if you disobeyed me."</p><p>"If I disobeyed you?" said Isabel in a low tone which had the effect of mildness.</p><p>"Let it be clear. If you leave Rome to-day it will be a piece of the most deliberate, the most calculated, opposition."</p><p>"How can you call it calculated? I received my aunt's telegram but three minutes ago."</p><p>"You calculate rapidly; it's a great accomplishment. I don't see whywe should prolong our discussion; you know my wish." And he stood thereas if he expected to see her withdraw.</p><p>But she never moved; she couldn't move, strange as it may seem; shestill wished to justify herself; he had the power, in an extraordinarydegree, of making her feel this need. There was something in herimagination he could always appeal to against her judgement. "You've noreason for such a wish," said Isabel, "and I've every reason for going.I can't tell you how unjust you seem to me. But I think you know. It'syour own opposition that's calculated. It's malignant."</p><p>She had never uttered her worst thought to her husband before, andthe sensation of hearing it was evidently new to Osmond. But he showedno surprise, and his coolness was apparently a proof that he hadbelieved his wife would in fact be unable to resist for ever hisingenious endeavour to draw her out. "It's all the more intense then,"he answered. And he added almost as if he were giving her a friendlycounsel: "This is a very important matter." She recognised that; shewas fully conscious of the weight of the occasion; she knew thatbetween them they had arrived at a crisis. Its gravity made hercareful; she said nothing, and he went on. "You say I've no reason? Ihave the very best. I dislike, from the bottom of my soul, what youintend to do. It's dishonourable; it's indelicate; it's indecent. Yourcousin is nothing whatever to me, and I'm under no obligation to makeconcessions to him. I've already made the very handsomest. Yourrelations with him, while he was here, kept me on pins and needles; butI let that pass, because from week to week I expected him to go. I'venever liked him and he has never liked me. That's why you likehim--because he hates me," said Osmond with a quick, barely audibletremor in his voice. "I've an ideal of what my wife should do andshould not do. She should not travel across Europe alone, in defianceof my deepest desire, to sit at the bedside of other men. Your cousin'snothing to you; he's nothing to us. You smile most expressively when Italk about US, but I assure you that WE, WE, Mrs. Osmond, is all Iknow. I take our marriage seriously; you appear to have found a way ofnot doing so. I'm not aware that we're divorced or separated; for mewe're indissolubly united. You are nearer to me than any humancreature, and I'm nearer to you. It may be a disagreeable proximity;it's one, at any rate, of our own deliberate making. You don't like tobe reminded of that, I know; but I'm perfectly willing,because--because--" And he paused a moment, looking as if he hadsomething to say which would be very much to the point. "Because Ithink we should accept the consequences of our actions, and what Ivalue most in life is the honour of a thing!"</p><p>He spoke gravely and almost gently; the accent of sarcasm haddropped out of his tone. It had a gravity which checked his wife'squick emotion; the resolution with which she had entered the room founditself caught in a mesh of fine threads. His last words were not acommand, they constituted a kind of appeal; and, though she felt thatany expression of respect on his part could only be a refinement ofegotism, they represented something transcendent and absolute, like thesign of the cross or the flag of one's country. He spoke in the name ofsomething sacred and precious--the observance of a magnificent form.They were as perfectly apart in feeling as two disillusioned lovers hadever been; but they had never yet separated in act. Isabel had notchanged; her old passion for justice still abode within her; and now,in the very thick of her sense of her husband's blasphemous sophistry,it began to throb to a tune which for a moment promised him thevictory. It came over her that in his wish to preserve appearances hewas after all sincere, and that this, as far as it went, was a merit.Ten minutes before she had felt all the joy of irreflective action--ajoy to which she had so long been a stranger; but action had beensuddenly changed to slow renunciation, transformed by the blight ofOsmond's touch. If she must renounce, however, she would let him knowshe was a victim rather than a dupe. "I know you're a master of the artof mockery," she said. "How can you speak of an indissoluble union--how can you speak of your being contented? Where's our union when youaccuse me of falsity? Where's your contentment when you have nothingbut hideous suspicion in your heart?"</p><p>"It is in our living decently together, in spite of such drawbacks."</p><p>"We don't live decently together!" cried Isabel.</p><p>"Indeed we don't if you go to England."</p><p>"That's very little; that's nothing. I might do much more."</p><p>He raised his eyebrows and even his shoulders a little: he had livedlong enough in Italy to catch this trick. "Ah, if you've come tothreaten me I prefer my drawing." And he walked back to his table,where he took up the sheet of paper on which he had been working andstood studying it.</p><p>"I suppose that if I go you'll not expect me to come back," said Isabel.</p><p>He turned quickly round, and she could see this movement at leastwas not designed. He looked at her a little, and then, "Are you out ofyour mind?" he enquired.</p><p>"How can it be anything but a rupture?" she went on; "especially ifall you say is true?" She was unable to see how it could be anythingbut a rupture; she sincerely wished to know what else it might be.</p><p>He sat down before his table. "I really can't argue with you on thehypothesis of your defying me," he said. And he took up one of hislittle brushes again.</p><p>She lingered but a moment longer; long enough to embrace with hereye his whole deliberately indifferent yet most expressive figure;after which she quickly left the room. Her faculties, her energy, herpassion, were all dispersed again; she felt as if a cold, dark mist hadsuddenly encompassed her. Osmond possessed in a supreme degree the artof eliciting any weakness. On her way back to her room she found theCountess Gemini standing in the open doorway of a little parlour inwhich a small collection of heterogeneous books had been arranged. TheCountess had an open volume in her hand; she appeared to have beenglancing down a page which failed to strike her as interesting. At thesound of Isabel's step she raised her head.</p><p>"Ah my dear," she said, "you, who are so literary, do tell me someamusing book to read! Everything here's of a dreariness--! Do you thinkthis would do me any good?"</p><p>Isabel glanced at the title of the volume she held out, but withoutreading or understanding it. "I'm afraid I can't advise you. I've hadbad news. My cousin, Ralph Touchett, is dying."</p><p>The Countess threw down her book. "Ah, he was so simpatico. I'm awfully sorry for you."</p><p>"You would be sorrier still if you knew."</p><p>"What is there to know? You look very badly," the Countess added. "You must have been with Osmond."</p><p>Half an hour before Isabel would have listened very coldly to anintimation that she should ever feel a desire for the sympathy of hersister-in-law, and there can be no better proof of her presentembarrassment than the fact that she almost clutched at this lady'sfluttering attention. "I've been with Osmond," she said, while theCountess's bright eyes glittered at her.</p><p>"I'm sure then he has been odious!" the Countess cried. "Did he say he was glad poor Mr. Touchett's dying?"</p><p>"He said it's impossible I should go to England."</p><p>The Countess's mind, when her interests were concerned, was agile;she already foresaw the extinction of any further brightness in hervisit to Rome. Ralph Touchett would die, Isabel would go into mourning,and then there would be no more dinner-parties. Such a prospectproduced for a moment in her countenance an expressive grimace; butthis rapid, picturesque play of feature was her only tribute todisappointment. After all, she reflected, the game was almost playedout; she had already overstayed her invitation. And then she caredenough for Isabel's trouble to forget her own, and she saw thatIsabel's trouble was deep.</p><p>It seemed deeper than the mere death of a cousin, and the Countesshad no hesitation in connecting her exasperating brother with theexpression of her sister-in-law's eyes. Her heart beat with an almostjoyous expectation, for if she had wished to see Osmond overtopped theconditions looked favourable now. Of course if Isabel should go toEngland she herself would immediately leave Palazzo Roccanera; nothingwould induce her to remain there with Osmond. Nevertheless she felt animmense desire to hear that Isabel would go to England. "Nothing'simpossible for you, my dear," she said caressingly. "Why else are yourich and clever and good?"</p><p>"Why indeed? I feel stupidly weak."</p><p>"Why does Osmond say it's impossible?" the Countess asked in a tone which sufficiently declared that she couldn't imagine.</p><p>From the moment she thus began to question her, however, Isabel drewback; she disengaged her hand, which the Countess had affectionatelytaken. But she answered this enquiry with frank bitterness. "Becausewe're so happy together that we can't separate even for a fortnight."</p><p>"Ah," cried the Countess while Isabel turned away, "when I want tomake a journey my husband simply tells me I can have no money!"</p><p>Isabel went to her room, where she walked up and down for an hour.It may appear to some readers that she gave herself much trouble, andit is certain that for a woman of a high spirit she had allowed herselfeasily to be arrested. It seemed to her that only now she fullymeasured the great undertaking of matrimony. Marriage meant that insuch a case as this, when one had to choose, one chose as a matter ofcourse for one's husband. "I'm afraid--yes, I'm afraid," she said toherself more than once, stopping short in her walk. But what she wasafraid of was not her husband--his displeasure, his hatred, hisrevenge; it was not even her own later judgement of her conduct aconsideration which had often held her in check; it was simply theviolence there would be in going when Osmond wished her to remain. Agulf of difference had opened between them, but nevertheless it was hisdesire that she should stay, it was a horror to him that she should go.She knew the nervous fineness with which he could feel an objection.What he thought of her she knew, what he was capable of saying to hershe had felt; yet they were married, for all that, and marriage meantthat a woman should cleave to the man with whom, uttering tremendousvows, she had stood at the altar. She sank down on her sofa at last andburied her head in a pile of cushions.</p><p>When she raised her head again the Countess Gemini hovered beforeher. She had come in all unperceived; she had a strange smile on herthin lips and her whole face had grown in an hour a shining intimation.She lived assuredly, it might be said, at the window of her spirit, butnow she was leaning far out. "I knocked," she began, "but you didn'tanswer me. So I ventured in. I've been looking at you for the past fiveminutes. You're very unhappy."</p><p>"Yes; but I don't think you can comfort me."</p><p>"Will you give me leave to try?" And the Countess sat down on thesofa beside her. She continued to smile, and there was somethingcommunicative and exultant in her expression. She appeared to have adeal to say, and it occurred to Isabel for the first time that hersister-in-law might say something really human. She made play with herglittering eyes, in which there was an unpleasant fascination. "Afterall," she soon resumed, "I must tell you, to begin with, that I don'tunderstand your state of mind. You seem to have so many scruples, somany reasons, so many ties. When I discovered, ten years ago, that myhusband's dearest wish was to make me miserable--of late he has simplylet me alone --ah, it was a wonderful simplification! My poor Isabel,you're not simple enough."</p><p>"No, I'm not simple enough," said Isabel.</p><p>"There's something I want you to know," the Countess declared--"because I think you ought to know it. Perhaps you do; perhaps you'veguessed it. But if you have, all I can say is that I understand stillless why you shouldn't do as you like."</p><p>"What do you wish me to know?" Isabel felt a foreboding that madeher heart beat faster. The Countess was about to justify herself, andthis alone was portentous.</p><p>But she was nevertheless disposed to play a little with her subject."In your place I should have guessed it ages ago. Have you never reallysuspected?"</p><p>"I've guessed nothing. What should I have suspected? I don't know what you mean."</p><p>"That's because you've such a beastly pure mind. I never saw a woman with such a pure mind!" cried the Countess.</p><p>Isabel slowly got up. "You're going to tell me something horrible."</p><p>"You can call it by whatever name you will!" And the Countess rosealso, while her gathered perversity grew vivid and dreadful. She stooda moment in a sort of glare of intention and, as seemed to Isabel eventhen, of ugliness; after which she said: "My first sister-in-law had nochildren."</p><p>Isabel stared back at her; the announcement was an anticlimax. "Your first sister-in-law?"</p><p>"I suppose you know at least, if one may mention it, that Osmond hasbeen married before! I've never spoken to you of his wife; I thought itmightn't be decent or respectful. But others, less particular, musthave done so. The poor little woman lived hardly three years and diedchildless. It wasn't till after her death that Pansy arrived."</p><p>Isabel's brow had contracted to a frown; her lips were parted inpale, vague wonder. She was trying to follow; there seemed so much moreto follow than she could see. "Pansy's not my husband's child then?"</p><p>"Your husband's--in perfection! But no one else's husband's. Someone else's wife's. Ah, my good Isabel," cried the Countess, "with youone must dot one's i's!"</p><p>"I don't understand. Whose wife's?" Isabel asked.</p><p>"The wife of a horrid little Swiss who died--how long?--a dozen,more than fifteen, years ago. He never recognised Miss Pansy, nor,knowing what he was about, would have anything to say to her; and therewas no reason why he should. Osmond did, and that was better; though hehad to fit on afterwards the whole rigmarole of his own wife's havingdied in childbirth, and of his having, in grief and horror, banishedthe little girl from his sight for as long as possible before takingher home from nurse. His wife had really died, you know, of quiteanother matter and in quite another place: in the Piedmontesemountains, where they had gone, one August, because her health appearedto require the air, but where she was suddenly taken worse-- fatallyill. The story passed, sufficiently; it was covered by the appearancesso long as nobody heeded, as nobody cared to look into it. But ofcourse I knew--without researches," the Countess lucidly proceeded; "asalso, you'll understand, without a word said between us--I mean betweenOsmond and me. Don't you see him looking at me, in silence, that way,to settle it?--that is to settle ME if I should say anything. I saidnothing, right or left--never a word to a creature, if you can believethat of me: on my honour, my dear, I speak of the thing to you now,after all this time, as I've never, never spoken. It was to be enoughfor me, from the first, that the child was my niece--from the momentshe was my brother's daughter. As for her veritable mother--!" But withthis Pansy's wonderful aunt dropped--as, involuntarily, from theimpression of her sister-in-law's face, out of which more eyes mighthave seemed to look at her than she had ever had to meet.</p><p>She had spoken no name, yet Isabel could but check, on her own lips,an echo of the unspoken. She sank to her seat again, hanging her head."Why have you told me this?" she asked in a voice the Countess hardlyrecognised.</p><p>"Because I've been so bored with your not knowing. I've been bored,frankly, my dear, with not having told you; as if, stupidly, all thistime I couldn't have managed! Ca me depasse, if you don't mind mysaying so, the things, all round you, that you've appeared to succeedin not knowing. It's a sort of assistance--aid to innocentignorance--that I've always been a bad hand at rendering; and in thisconnexion, that of keeping quiet for my brother, my virtue has at anyrate finally found itself exhausted. It's not a black lie, moreover,you know," the Countess inimitably added. "The facts are exactly what Itell you."</p><p>"I had no idea," said Isabel presently; and looked up at her in amanner that doubtless matched the apparent witlessness of thisconfession.</p><p>"So I believed--though it was hard to believe. Had it never occurred to you that he was for six or seven years her lover?"</p><p>"I don't know. Things HAVE occurred to me, and perhaps that was what they all meant."</p><p>"She has been wonderfully clever, she has been magnificent, about Pansy!" the Countess, before all this view of it, cried.</p><p>"Oh, no idea, for me," Isabel went on, "ever DEFINITELY took thatform." She appeared to be making out to herself what had been and whathadn't. "And as it is--I don't understand."</p><p>She spoke as one troubled and puzzled, yet the poor Countess seemedto have seen her revelation fall below its possibilities of effect. Shehad expected to kindle some responsive blaze, but had barely extracteda spark. Isabel showed as scarce more impressed than she might havebeen, as a young woman of approved imagination, with some fine sinisterpassage of public history. "Don't you recognise how the child couldnever pass for HER husband's?--that is with M. Merle himself," hercompanion resumed. "They had been separated too long for that, and hehad gone to some far country--I think to South America. If she had everhad children--which I'm not sure of--she had lost them. The conditionshappened to make it workable, under stress (I mean at so awkward apinch), that Osmond should acknowledge the little girl. His wife wasdead--very true; but she had not been dead too long to put a certainaccommodation of dates out of the question--from the moment, I mean,that suspicion wasn't started; which was what they had to take care of.What was more natural than that poor Mrs. Osmond, at a distance and fora world not troubling about trifles, should have left behind her,poverina, the pledge of her brief happiness that had cost her her life?With the aid of a change of residence--Osmond had been living with herat Naples at the time of their stay in the Alps, and he in due courseleft it for ever--the whole history was successfully set going. My poorsister-in-law, in her grave, couldn't help herself, and the realmother, to save HER skin, renounced all visible property in the child."</p><p>"Ah, poor, poor woman!" cried Isabel, who herewith burst into tears.It was a long time since she had shed any; she had suffered a highreaction from weeping. But now they flowed with an abundance in whichthe Countess Gemini found only another discomfiture.</p><p>"It's very kind of you to pity her!" she discordantly laughed. "Yes indeed, you have a way of your own--!"</p><p>"He must have been false to his wife--and so very soon!" said Isabel with a sudden check.</p><p>"That's all that's wanting--that you should take up her cause!" theCountess went on. "I quite agree with you, however, that it was muchtoo soon."</p><p>"But to me, to me--?" And Isabel hesitated as if she had not heard;as if her question--though it was sufficiently there in her eyes--wereall for herself.</p><p>"To you he has been faithful? Well, it depends, my dear, on what youcall faithful. When he married you he was no longer the lover ofanother woman--SUCH a lover as he had been, cara mia, between theirrisks and their precautions, while the thing lasted! That state ofaffairs had passed away; the lady had repented, or at all events, forreasons of her own, drawn back: she had always had, too, a worship ofappearances so intense that even Osmond himself had got bored with it.You may therefore imagine what it was--when he couldn't patch it onconveniently to ANY of those he goes in for! But the whole past wasbetween them."</p><p>"Yes," Isabel mechanically echoed, "the whole past is between them."</p><p>"Ah, this later past is nothing. But for six or seven years, as I say, they had kept it up."</p><p>She was silent a little. "Why then did she want him to marry me?"</p><p>"Ah my dear, that's her superiority! Because you had money; and because she believed you would be good to Pansy."</p><p>"Poor woman--and Pansy who doesn't like her!" cried Isabel.</p><p>"That's the reason she wanted some one whom Pansy would like. She knows it; she knows everything."</p><p>"Will she know that you've told me this?"</p><p>"That will depend upon whether you tell her. She's prepared for it,and do you know what she counts upon for her defence? On your believingthat I lie. Perhaps you do; don't make yourself uncomfortable to hideit. Only, as it happens this time, I don't. I've told plenty of littleidiotic fibs, but they've never hurt any one but myself."</p><p>Isabel sat staring at her companion's story as at a bale offantastic wares some strolling gypsy might have unpacked on the carpetat her feet. "Why did Osmond never marry her?" she finally asked.</p><p>"Because she had no money." The Countess had an answer foreverything, and if she lied she lied well. "No one knows, no one hasever known, what she lives on, or how she has got all those beautifulthings. I don't believe Osmond himself knows. Besides, she wouldn'thave married him."</p><p>"How can she have loved him then?"</p><p>"She doesn't love him in that way. She did at first, and then, Isuppose, she would have married him; but at that time her husband wasliving. By the time M. Merle had rejoined--I won't say his ancestors,because he never had any--her relations with Osmond had changed, andshe had grown more ambitious. Besides, she has never had, about him,"the Countess went on, leaving Isabel to wince for it so tragicallyafterwards--"she HAD never had, what you might call any illusions ofINTELLIGENCE. She hoped she might marry a great man; that has alwaysbeen her idea. She has waited and watched and plotted and prayed; butshe has never succeeded. I don't call Madame Merle a success, you know.I don't know what she may accomplish yet, but at present she has verylittle to show. The only tangible result she has ever achieved--except,of course, getting to know every one and staying with them free ofexpense--has been her bringing you and Osmond together. Oh, she didthat, my dear; you needn't look as if you doubted it. I've watched themfor years; I know everything--everything. I'm thought a greatscatterbrain, but I've had enough application of mind to follow upthose two. She hates me, and her way of showing it is to pretend to befor ever defending me. When people say I've had fifteen lovers shelooks horrified and declares that quite half of them were never proved.She has been afraid of me for years, and she has taken great comfort inthe vile, false things people have said about me. She has been afraidI'd expose her, and she threatened me one day when Osmond began to payhis court to you. It was at his house in Florence; do you remember thatafternoon when she brought you there and we had tea in the garden? Shelet me know then that if I should tell tales two could play at thatgame. She pretends there's a good deal more to tell about me than abouther. It would be an interesting comparison! I don't care a fig what shemay say, simply because I know YOU don't care a fig. You can't troubleyour head about me less than you do already. So she may take herrevenge as she chooses; I don't think she'll frighten you very much.Her great idea has been to be tremendously irreproachable--a kind offull-blown lily--the incarnation of propriety. She has alwaysworshipped that god. There should be no scandal about Caesar's wife,you know; and, as I say, she has always hoped to marry Caesar. That wasone reason she wouldn't marry Osmond; the fear that on seeing her withPansy people would put things together-- would even see a resemblance.She has had a terror lest the mother should betray herself. She hasbeen awfully careful; the mother has never done so."</p><p>"Yes, yes, the mother has done so," said Isabel, who had listened toall this with a face more and more wan. "She betrayed herself to me theother day, though I didn't recognise her. There appeared to have been achance of Pansy's making a great marriage, and in her disappointment atits not coming off she almost dropped the mask."</p><p>"Ah, that's where she'd dish herself!" cried the Countess. "She hasfailed so dreadfully that she's determined her daughter shall make itup."</p><p>Isabel started at the words "her daughter," which her guest threwoff so familiarly. "It seems very wonderful," she murmured; and in thisbewildering impression she had almost lost her sense of beingpersonally touched by the story.</p><p>"Now don't go and turn against the poor innocent child!" theCountess went on. "She's very nice, in spite of her deplorable origin.I myself have liked Pansy; not, naturally, because she was hers, butbecause she had become yours."</p><p>"Yes, she has become mine. And how the poor woman must have sufferedat seeing me--!" Isabel exclaimed while she flushed at the thought.</p><p>"I don't believe she has suffered; on the contrary, she has enjoyed.Osmond's marriage has given his daughter a great little lift. Beforethat she lived in a hole. And do you know what the mother thought? Thatyou might take such a fancy to the child that you'd do something forher. Osmond of course could never give her a portion. Osmond was reallyextremely poor; but of course you know all about that. Ah, my dear,"cried the Countess, "why did you ever inherit money?" She stopped amoment as if she saw something singular in Isabel's face. "Don't tellme now that you'll give her a dot. You're capable of that, but I wouldrefuse to believe it. Don't try to be too good. Be a little easy andnatural and nasty; feel a little wicked, for the comfort of it, once inyour life!"</p><p>"It's very strange. I suppose I ought to know, but I'm sorry," Isabel said. "I'm much obliged to you."</p><p>"Yes, you seem to be!" cried the Countess with a mocking laugh."Perhaps you are--perhaps you're not. You don't take it as I shouldhave thought."</p><p>"How should I take it?" Isabel asked.</p><p>"Well, I should say as a woman who has been made use of." Isabelmade no answer to this; she only listened, and the Countess went on."They've always been bound to each other; they remained so even aftershe broke off--or HE did. But he has always been more for her than shehas been for him. When their little carnival was over they made abargain that each should give the other complete liberty, but that eachshould also do everything possible to help the other on. You may ask mehow I know such a thing as that. I know it by the way they've behaved.Now see how much better women are than men! She has found a wife forOsmond, but Osmond has never lifted a little finger for HER. She hasworked for him, plotted for him, suffered for him; she has even morethan once found money for him; and the end of it is that he's tired ofher. She's an old habit; there are moments when he needs her, but onthe whole he wouldn't miss her if she were removed. And, what's more,today she knows it. So you needn't be jealous!" the Countess addedhumorously.</p><p>Isabel rose from her sofa again; she felt bruised and scant ofbreath; her head was humming with new knowledge. "I'm much obliged toyou," she repeated. And then she added abruptly, in quite a differenttone: "How do you know all this?"</p><p>This enquiry appeared to ruffle the Countess more than Isabel'sexpression of gratitude pleased her. She gave her companion a boldstare, with which, "Let us assume that I've invented it!" she cried.She too, however, suddenly changed her tone and, laying her hand onIsabel's arm, said with the penetration of her sharp bright smile: "Nowwill you give up your journey?"</p><p>Isabel started a little; she turned away. But she felt weak and in amoment had to lay her arm upon the mantel-shelf for support. She stooda minute so, and then upon her arm she dropped her dizzy head, withclosed eyes and pale lips.</p><p>"I've done wrong to speak--I've made you ill!" the Countess cried.</p><p>"Ah, I must see Ralph!" Isabel wailed; not in resentment, not in thequick passion her companion had looked for; but in a tone offar-reaching, infinite sadness.</p></span><span id = 1001 ><p>There was a train for Turin and Paris that evening; and after theCountess had left her Isabel had a rapid and decisive conference withher maid, who was discreet, devoted and active. After this she thought(except of her journey) only of one thing. She must go and see Pansy;from her she couldn't turn away. She had not seen her yet, as Osmondhad given her to understand that it was too soon to begin. She drove atfive o'clock to a high floor in a narrow street in the quarter of thePiazza Navona, and was admitted by the portress of the convent, agenial and obsequious person. Isabel had been at this institutionbefore; she had come with Pansy to see the sisters. She knew they weregood women, and she saw that the large rooms were clean and cheerfuland that the well-used garden had sun for winter and shade for spring.But she disliked the place, which affronted and almost frightened her;not for the world would she have spent a night there. It producedto-day more than before the impression of a well-appointed prison; forit was not possible to pretend Pansy was free to leave it. Thisinnocent creature had been presented to her in a new and violent light,but the secondary effect of the revelation was to make her reach out ahand.</p><p>The portress left her to wait in the parlour of the convent whileshe went to make it known that there was a visitor for the dear younglady. The parlour was a vast, cold apartment, with new-lookingfurniture; a large clean stove of white porcelain, unlighted, acollection of wax flowers under glass, and a series of engravings fromreligious pictures on the walls. On the other occasion Isabel hadthought it less like Rome than like Philadelphia, but to-day she madeno reflexions; the apartment only seemed to her very empty and verysoundless. The portress returned at the end of some five minutes,ushering in another person. Isabel got up, expecting to see one of theladies of the sisterhood, but to her extreme surprise found herselfconfronted with Madame Merle. The effect was strange, for Madame Merlewas already so present to her vision that her appearance in the fleshwas like suddenly, and rather awfully, seeing a painted picture move.Isabel had been thinking all day of her falsity, her audacity, herability, her probable suffering; and these dark things seemed to flashwith a sudden light as she entered the room. Her being there at all hadthe character of ugly evidence, of handwritings, of profaned relics, ofgrim things produced in court. It made Isabel feel faint; if it hadbeen necessary to speak on the spot she would have been quite unable.But no such necessity was distinct to her; it seemed to her indeed thatshe had absolutely nothing to say to Madame Merle. In one's relationswith this lady, however, there were never any absolute necessities; shehad a manner which carried off not only her own deficiencies but thoseof other people. But she was different from usual; she came in slowly,behind the portress, and Isabel instantly perceived that she was notlikely to depend upon her habitual resources. For her too the occasionwas exceptional, and she had undertaken to treat it by the light of themoment. This gave her a peculiar gravity; she pretended not even tosmile, and though Isabel saw that she was more than ever playing a partit seemed to her that on the whole the wonderful woman had never beenso natural. She looked at her young friend from head to foot, but notharshly nor defiantly; with a cold gentleness rather, and an absence ofany air of allusion to their last meeting. It was as if she had wishedto mark a distinction. She had been irritated then, she was reconcilednow.</p><p>"You can leave us alone," she said to the portress; "in five minutesthis lady will ring for you." And then she turned to Isabel, who, afternoting what has just been mentioned, had ceased to notice and had lether eyes wander as far as the limits of the room would allow. Shewished never to look at Madame Merle again. "You're surprised to findme here, and I'm afraid you're not pleased," this lady went on. "Youdon't see why I should have come; it's as if I had anticipated you. Iconfess I've been rather indiscreet--I ought to have asked yourpermission." There was none of the oblique movement of irony in this;it was said simply and mildly; but Isabel, far afloat on a sea ofwonder and pain, could not have told herself with what intention it wasuttered. "But I've not been sitting long," Madame Merle continued;"that is I've not been long with Pansy. I came to see her because itoccurred to me this afternoon that she must be rather lonely andperhaps even a little miserable. It may be good for a small girl; Iknow so little about small girls; I can't tell. At any rate it's alittle dismal. Therefore I came--on the chance. I knew of course thatyou'd come, and her father as well; still, I had not been told othervisitors were forbidden. The good woman--what's her name? MadameCatherine--made no objection whatever. I stayed twenty minutes withPansy; she has a charming little room, not in the least conventual,with a piano and flowers. She has arranged it delightfully; she has somuch taste. Of course it's all none of my business, but I feel happiersince I've seen her. She may even have a maid if she likes; but ofcourse she has no occasion to dress. She wears a little black frock;she looks so charming. I went afterwards to see Mother Catherine, whohas a very good room too; I assure you I don't find the poor sisters atall monastic. Mother Catherine has a most coquettish littletoilet-table, with something that looked uncommonly like a bottle ofeau-de-Cologne. She speaks delightfully of Pansy; says it's a greathappiness for them to have her. She's a little saint of heaven and amodel to the oldest of them. Just as I was leaving Madame Catherine theportress came to say to her that there was a lady for the signorina. Ofcourse I knew it must be you, and I asked her to let me go and receiveyou in her place. She demurred greatly--I must tell you that--and saidit was her duty to notify the Mother Superior; it was of such highimportance that you should be treated with respect. I requested her tolet the Mother Superior alone and asked her how she supposed I wouldtreat you!"</p><p>So Madame Merle went on, with much of the brilliancy of a woman whohad long been a mistress of the art of conversation. But there werephases and gradations in her speech, not one of which was lost uponIsabel's ear, though her eyes were absent from her companion's face.She had not proceeded far before Isabel noted a sudden break in hervoice, a lapse in her continuity, which was in itself a complete drama.This subtle modulation marked a momentous discovery--the perception ofan entirely new attitude on the part of her listener. Madame Merle hadguessed in the space of an instant that everything was at end betweenthem, and in the space of another instant she had guessed the reasonwhy. The person who stood there was not the same one she had seenhitherto, but was a very different person--a person who knew hersecret. This discovery was tremendous, and from the moment she made itthe most accomplished of women faltered and lost her courage. But onlyfor that moment. Then the conscious stream of her perfect mannergathered itself again and flowed on as smoothly as might be to the end.But it was only because she had the end in view that she was able toproceed. She had been touched with a point that made her quiver, andshe needed all the alertness of her will to repress her agitation. Heronly safety was in her not betraying herself. She resisted this, butthe startled quality of her voice refused to improve--she couldn't helpit--while she heard herself say she hardly knew what. The tide of herconfidence ebbed, and she was able only just to glide into port,faintly grazing the bottom.</p><p>Isabel saw it all as distinctly as if it had been reflected in alarge clear glass. It might have been a great moment for her, for itmight have been a moment of triumph. That Madame Merle had lost herpluck and saw before her the phantom of exposure--this in itself was arevenge, this in itself was almost the promise of a brighter day. Andfor a moment during which she stood apparently looking out of thewindow, with her back half-turned, Isabel enjoyed that knowledge. Onthe other side of the window lay the garden of the convent; but this isnot what she saw; she saw nothing of the budding plants and the glowingafternoon. She saw, in the crude light of that revelation which hadalready become a part of experience and to which the very frailty ofthe vessel in which it had been offered her only gave an intrinsicprice, the dry staring fact that she had been an applied handledhung-up tool, as senseless and convenient as mere shaped wood and iron.All the bitterness of this knowledge surged into her soul again; it wasas if she felt on her lips the taste of dishonour. There was a momentduring which, if she had turned and spoken, she would have saidsomething that would hiss like a lash. But she closed her eyes, andthen the hideous vision dropped. What remained was the cleverest womanin the world standing there within a few feet of her and knowing aslittle what to think as the meanest. Isabel's only revenge was to besilent still--to leave Madame Merle in this unprecedented situation.She left her there for a period that must have seemed long to thislady, who at last seated herself with a movement which was in itself aconfession of helplessness. Then Isabel turned slow eyes, looking downat her. Madame Merle was very pale; her own eyes covered Isabel's face.She might see what she would, but her danger was over. Isabel wouldnever accuse her, never reproach her; perhaps because she never wouldgive her the opportunity to defend herself.</p><p>"I'm come to bid Pansy good-bye," our young woman said at last. "I go to England to-night."</p><p>"Go to England to-night!" Madame Merle repeated sitting there and looking up at her.</p><p>"I'm going to Gardencourt. Ralph Touchett's dying."</p><p>"Ah, you'll feel that." Madame Merle recovered herself; she had a chance to express sympathy. "Do you go alone?"</p><p>"Yes; without my husband."</p><p>Madame Merle gave a low vague murmur; a sort of recognition of thegeneral sadness of things. "Mr. Touchett never liked me, but I'm sorryhe's dying. Shall you see his mother?"</p><p>"Yes; she has returned from America."</p><p>"She used to be very kind to me; but she has changed. Others toohave changed," said Madame Merle with a quiet noble pathos. She pauseda moment, then added: "And you'll see dear old Gardencourt again!"</p><p>"I shall not enjoy it much," Isabel answered.</p><p>"Naturally--in your grief. But it's on the whole, of all the housesI know, and I know many, the one I should have liked best to live in. Idon't venture to send a message to the people," Madame Merle added;"but I should like to give my love to the place."</p><p>Isabel turned away. "I had better go to Pansy. I've not much time."</p><p>While she looked about her for the proper egress, the door openedand admitted one of the ladies of the house, who advanced with adiscreet smile, gently rubbing, under her long loose sleeves, a pair ofplump white hands. Isabel recognised Madame Catherine, whoseacquaintance she had already made, and begged that she wouldimmediately let her see Miss Osmond. Madame Catherine looked doublydiscreet, but smiled very blandly and said: "It will be good for her tosee you. I'll take you to her myself." Then she directed her pleasedguarded vision to Madame Merle.</p><p>"Will you let me remain a little?" this lady asked. "It's so good to be here."</p><p>"You may remain always if you like!" And the good sister gave a knowing laugh.</p><p>She led Isabel out of the room, through several corridors, and up along staircase. All these departments were solid and bare, light andclean; so, thought Isabel, are the great penal establishments. MadameCatherine gently pushed open the door of Pansy's room and ushered inthe visitor; then stood smiling with folded hands while the two othersmet and embraced.</p><p>"She's glad to see you," she repeated; "it will do her good." Andshe placed the best chair carefully for Isabel. But she made nomovement to seat herself; she seemed ready to retire. "How does thisdear child look?" she asked of Isabel, lingering a moment.</p><p>"She looks pale," Isabel answered.</p><p>"That's the pleasure of seeing you. She's very happy. Elle eclaire la maison," said the good sister.</p><p>Pansy wore, as Madame Merle had said, a little black dress; it wasperhaps this that made her look pale. "They're very good to me--theythink of everything!" she exclaimed with all her customary eagerness toaccommodate.</p><p>"We think of you always--you're a precious charge," Madame Catherineremarked in the tone of a woman with whom benevolence was a habit andwhose conception of duty was the acceptance of every care. It fell witha leaden weight on Isabel's ears; it seemed to represent the surrenderof a personality, the authority of the Church.</p><p>When Madame Catherine had left them together Pansy kneeled down andhid her head in her stepmother's lap. So she remained some moments,while Isabel gently stroked her hair. Then she got up, averting herface and looking about the room. "Don't you think I've arranged itwell? I've everything I have at home."</p><p>"It's very pretty; you're very comfortable." Isabel scarcely knewwhat she could say to her. On the one hand she couldn't let her thinkshe had come to pity her, and on the other it would be a dull mockeryto pretend to rejoice with her. So she simply added after a moment:"I've come to bid you good-bye. I'm going to England."</p><p>Pansy's white little face turned red. "To England! Not to come back?"</p><p>"I don't know when I shall come back."</p><p>"Ah, I'm sorry," Pansy breathed with faintness. She spoke as if shehad no right to criticise; but her tone expressed a depth ofdisappointment.</p><p>"My cousin, Mr. Touchett, is very ill; he'll probably die. I wish to see him," Isabel said.</p><p>"Ah yes; you told me he would die. Of course you must go. And will papa go?"</p><p>"No; I shall go alone."</p><p>For a moment the girl said nothing. Isabel had often wondered whatshe thought of the apparent relations of her father with his wife; butnever by a glance, by an intimation, had she let it be seen that shedeemed them deficient in an air of intimacy. She made her reflexions,Isabel was sure; and she must have had a conviction that there werehusbands and wives who were more intimate than that. But Pansy was notindiscreet even in thought; she would as little have ventured to judgeher gentle stepmother as to criticise her magnificent father. Her heartmay have stood almost as still as it would have done had she seen twoof the saints in the great picture in the convent chapel turn theirpainted heads and shake them at each other. But as in this latter caseshe would (for very solemnity's sake) never have mentioned the awfulphenomenon, so she put away all knowledge of the secrets of largerlives than her own. "You'll be very far away," she presently went on.</p><p>"Yes; I shall be far away. But it will scarcely matter," Isabelexplained; "since so long as you're here I can't be called near you."</p><p>"Yes, but you can come and see me; though you've not come very often."</p><p>"I've not come because your father forbade it. To-day I bring nothing with me. I can't amuse you."</p><p>"I'm not to be amused. That's not what papa wishes."</p><p>"Then it hardly matters whether I'm in Rome or in England."</p><p>"You're not happy, Mrs. Osmond," said Pansy.</p><p>"Not very. But it doesn't matter."</p><p>"That's what I say to myself. What does it matter? But I should like to come out."</p><p>"I wish indeed you might."</p><p>"Don't leave me here," Pansy went on gently.</p><p>Isabel said nothing for a minute; her heart beat fast. "Will you come away with me now?" she asked.</p><p>Pansy looked at her pleadingly. "Did papa tell you to bring me?"</p><p>"No; it's my own proposal."</p><p>"I think I had better wait then. Did papa send me no message?"</p><p>"I don't think he knew I was coming."</p><p>"He thinks I've not had enough," said Pansy. "But I have. The ladiesare very kind to me and the little girls come to see me. There are somevery little ones--such charming children. Then my room--you can see foryourself. All that's very delightful. But I've had enough. Papa wishedme to think a little--and I've thought a great deal."</p><p>"What have you thought?"</p><p>"Well, that I must never displease papa."</p><p>"You knew that before."</p><p>"Yes; but I know it better. I'll do anything--I'll do anything,"said Pansy. Then, as she heard her own words, a deep, pure blush cameinto her face. Isabel read the meaning of it; she saw the poor girl hadbeen vanquished. It was well that Mr. Edward Rosier had kept hisenamels! Isabel looked into her eyes and saw there mainly a prayer tobe treated easily. She laid her hand on Pansy's as if to let her knowthat her look conveyed no diminution of esteem; for the collapse of thegirl's momentary resistance (mute and modest thought it had been)seemed only her tribute to the truth of things. She didn't presume tojudge others, but she had judged herself; she had seen the reality. Shehad no vocation for struggling with combinations; in the solemnity ofsequestration there was something that overwhelmed her. She bowed herpretty head to authority and only asked of authority to be merciful.Yes; it was very well that Edward Rosier had reserved a few articles!</p><p>Isabel got up; her time was rapidly shortening. "Good-bye then. I leave Rome to-night."</p><p>Pansy took hold of her dress; there was a sudden change in the child's face. "You look strange, you frighten me."</p><p>"Oh, I'm very harmless," said Isabel.</p><p>"Perhaps you won't come back?"</p><p>"Perhaps not. I can't tell."</p><p>"Ah, Mrs. Osmond, you won't leave me!"</p><p>Isabel now saw she had guessed everything. "My dear child, what can I do for you?" she asked.</p><p>"I don't know--but I'm happier when I think of you."</p><p>"You can always think of me."</p><p>"Not when you're so far. I'm a little afraid," said Pansy.</p><p>"What are you afraid of?"</p><p>"Of papa--a little. And of Madame Merle. She has just been to see me."</p><p>"You must not say that," Isabel observed.</p><p>"Oh, I'll do everything they want. Only if you're here I shall do it more easily."</p><p>Isabel considered. "I won't desert you," she said at last. "Good-bye, my child."</p><p>Then they held each other a moment in a silent embrace, like twosisters; and afterwards Pansy walked along the corridor with hervisitor to the top of the staircase. "Madame Merle has been here," sheremarked as they went; and as Isabel answered nothing she addedabruptly: "I don't like Madame Merle!"</p><p>Isabel hesitated, then stopped. "You must never say that--that you don't like Madame Merle."</p><p>Pansy looked at her in wonder; but wonder with Pansy had never beena reason for non-compliance. "I never will again," she said withexquisite gentleness. At the top of the staircase they had to separate,as it appeared to be part of the mild but very definite disciplineunder which Pansy lived that she should not go down. Isabel descended,and when she reached the bottom the girl was standing above. "You'llcome back?" she called out in a voice that Isabel remembered afterwards.</p><p>"Yes--I'll come back."</p><p>Madame Catherine met Mrs. Osmond below and conducted her to the doorof the parlour, outside of which the two stood talking a minute. "Iwon't go in," said the good sister. "Madame Merle's waiting for you."</p><p>At this announcement Isabel stiffened; she was on the point ofasking if there were no other egress from the convent. But a moment'sreflexion assured her that she would do well not to betray to theworthy nun her desire to avoid Pansy's other friend. Her companiongrasped her arm very gently and, fixing her a moment with wise,benevolent eyes, said in French and almost familiarly: "Eh bien, chereMadame, qu'en pensez-vous?"</p><p>"About my step-daughter? Oh, it would take long to tell you."</p><p>"We think it's enough," Madame Catherine distinctly observed. And she pushed open the door of the parlour.</p><p>Madame Merle was sitting just as Isabel had left her, like a womanso absorbed in thought that she had not moved a little finger. AsMadame Catherine closed the door she got up, and Isabel saw that shehad been thinking to some purpose. She had recovered her balance; shewas in full possession of her resources. "I found I wished to wait foryou," she said urbanely. "But it's not to talk about Pansy."</p><p>Isabel wondered what it could be to talk about, and in spite ofMadame Merle's declaration she answered after a moment: "MadameCatherine says it's enough."</p><p>"Yes; it also seems to me enough. I wanted to ask you another wordabout poor Mr. Touchett," Madame Merle added. "Have you reason tobelieve that he's really at his last?"</p><p>"I've no information but a telegram. Unfortunately it only confirms a probability."</p><p>"I'm going to ask you a strange question," said Madame Merle. "Areyou very fond of your cousin?" And she gave a smile as strange as herutterance.</p><p>"Yes, I'm very fond of him. But I don't understand you."</p><p>She just hung fire. "It's rather hard to explain. Something hasoccurred to me which may not have occurred to you, and I give you thebenefit of my idea. Your cousin did you once a great service. Have younever guessed it?"</p><p>"He has done me many services."</p><p>"Yes; but one was much above the rest. He made you a rich woman."</p><p>"HE made me--?"</p><p>Madame Merle appearing to see herself successful, she went on moretriumphantly: "He imparted to you that extra lustre which was requiredto make you a brilliant match. At bottom it's him you've to thank." Shestopped; there was something in Isabel's eyes.</p><p>"I don't understand you. It was my uncle's money."</p><p>"Yes; it was your uncle's money, but it was your cousin's idea. Hebrought his father over to it. Ah, my dear, the sum was large!"</p><p>Isabel stood staring; she seemed to-day to live in a world illuminedby lurid flashes. "I don't know why you say such things. I don't knowwhat you know."</p><p>"I know nothing but what I've guessed. But I've guessed that."</p><p>Isabel went to the door and, when she had opened it, stood a momentwith her hand on the latch. Then she said--it was her only revenge: "Ibelieved it was you I had to thank!"</p><p>Madame Merle dropped her eyes; she stood there in a kind of proud penance. "You're very unhappy, I know. But I'm more so."</p><p>"Yes; I can believe that. I think I should like never to see you again."</p><p>Madame Merle raised her eyes. "I shall go to America," she quietly remarked while Isabel passed out.</p></span><span id = 1002 ><p>It was not with surprise, it was with a feeling which in othercircumstances would have had much of the effect of joy, that as Isabeldescended from the Paris Mail at Charing Cross she stepped into thearms, as it were--or at any rate into the hands--of HenriettaStackpole. She had telegraphed to her friend from Turin, and though shehad not definitely said to herself that Henrietta would meet her, shehad felt her telegram would produce some helpful result. On her longjourney from Rome her mind had been given up to vagueness; she wasunable to question the future. She performed this journey withsightless eyes and took little pleasure in the countries she traversed,decked out though they were in the richest freshness of spring. Herthoughts followed their course through othercountries--strange-looking, dimly-lighted, pathless lands, in whichthere was no change of seasons, but only, as it seemed, a perpetualdreariness of winter. She had plenty to think about; but it was neitherreflexion nor conscious purpose that filled her mind. Disconnectedvisions passed through it, and sudden dull gleams of memory, ofexpectation. The past and the future came and went at their will, butshe saw them only in fitful images, which rose and fell by a logic oftheir own. It was extraordinary the things she remembered. Now that shewas in the secret, now that she knew something that so much concernedher and the eclipse of which had made life resemble an attempt to playwhist with an imperfect pack of cards, the truth of things, theirmutual relations, their meaning, and for the most part their horror,rose before her with a kind of architectural vastness. She remembered athousand trifles; they started to life with the spontaneity of ashiver. She had thought them trifles at the time; now she saw that theyhad been weighted with lead. Yet even now they were trifles after all,for of what use was it to her to understand them? Nothing seemed of useto her to-day. All purpose, all intention, was suspended; all desiretoo save the single desire to reach her much-embracing refuge.Gardencourt had been her starting-point, and to those muffled chambersit was at least a temporary solution to return. She had gone forth inher strength; she would come back in her weakness, and if the place hadbeen a rest to her before, it would be a sanctuary now. She enviedRalph his dying, for if one were thinking of rest that was the mostperfect of all. To cease utterly, to give it all up and not knowanything more--this idea was as sweet as the vision of a cool bath in amarble tank, in a darkened chamber, in a hot land.</p><p>She had moments indeed in her journey from Rome which were almost asgood as being dead. She sat in her corner, so motionless, so passive,simply with the sense of being carried, so detached from hope andregret, that she recalled to herself one of those Etruscan figurescouched upon the receptacle of their ashes. There was nothing to regretnow--that was all over. Not only the time of her folly, but the time ofher repentance was far. The only thing to regret was that Madame Merlehad been so--well, so unimaginable. Just here her intelligence dropped,from literal inability to say what it was that Madame Merle had been.Whatever it was it was for Madame Merle herself to regret it; anddoubtless she would do so in America, where she had announced she wasgoing. It concerned Isabel no more; she only had an impression that sheshould never again see Madame Merle. This impression carried her intothe future, of which from time to time she had a mutilated glimpse. Shesaw herself, in the distant years, still in the attitude of a woman whohad her life to live, and these intimations contradicted the spirit ofthe present hour. It might be desirable to get quite away, really away,further away than little grey-green England, but this privilege wasevidently to be denied her. Deep in her soul--deeper than any appetitefor renunciation--was the sense that life would be her business for along time to come. And at moments there was something inspiring, almostenlivening, in the conviction. It was a proof of strength--it was aproof she should some day be happy again. It couldn't be she was tolive only to suffer; she was still young, after all, and a great manythings might happen to her yet. To live only to suffer--only to feelthe injury of life repeated and enlarged--it seemed to her she was toovaluable, too capable, for that. Then she wondered if it were vain andstupid to think so well of herself. When had it even been a guaranteeto be valuable? Wasn't all history full of the destruction of preciousthings? Wasn't it much more probable that if one were fine one wouldsuffer? It involved then perhaps an admission that one had a certaingrossness; but Isabel recognised, as it passed before her eyes, thequick vague shadow of a long future. She should never escape; sheshould last to the end. Then the middle years wrapped her about againand the grey curtain of her indifference closed her in.</p><p>Henrietta kissed her, as Henrietta usually kissed, as if she wereafraid she should be caught doing it; and then Isabel stood there inthe crowd, looking about her, looking for her servant. She askednothing; she wished to wait. She had a sudden perception that sheshould be helped. She rejoiced Henrietta had come; there was somethingterrible in an arrival in London. The dusky, smoky, far-arching vaultof the station, the strange, livid light, the dense, dark, pushingcrowd, filled her with a nervous fear and made her put her arm into herfriend's. She remembered she had once liked these things; they seemedpart of a mighty spectacle in which there was something that touchedher. She remembered how she walked away from Euston, in the winterdusk, in the crowded streets, five years before. She could not havedone that to-day, and the incident came before her as the deed ofanother person.</p><p>"It's too beautiful that you should have come," said Henrietta,looking at her as if she thought Isabel might be prepared to challengethe proposition. "If you hadn't--if you hadn't; well, I don't know,"remarked Miss Stackpole, hinting ominously at her powers of disapproval.</p><p>Isabel looked about without seeing her maid. Her eyes rested onanother figure, however, which she felt she had seen before; and in amoment she recognised the genial countenance of Mr. Bantling. He stooda little apart, and it was not in the power of the multitude thatpressed about him to make him yield an inch of the ground he hadtaken--that of abstracting himself discreetly while the two ladiesperformed their embraces.</p><p>"There's Mr. Bantling," said Isabel, gently, irrelevantly, scarcely caring much now whether she should find her maid or not.</p><p>"Oh yes, he goes everywhere with me. Come here, Mr. Bantling!"Henrietta exclaimed. Whereupon the gallant bachelor advanced with asmile--a smile tempered, however, by the gravity of the occasion."Isn't it lovely she has come?" Henrietta asked. "He knows all aboutit," she added; "we had quite a discussion. He said you wouldn't, Isaid you would."</p><p>"I thought you always agreed," Isabel smiled in return. She felt shecould smile now; she had seen in an instant, in Mr. Bantling's braveeyes, that he had good news for her. They seemed to say he wished herto remember he was an old friend of her cousin--that he understood,that it was all right. Isabel gave him her hand; she thought of him,extravagantly, as a beautiful blameless knight.</p><p>"Oh, I always agree," said Mr. Bantling. "But she doesn't, you know."</p><p>"Didn't I tell you that a maid was a nuisance?" Henrietta enquired. "Your young lady has probably remained at Calais."</p><p>"I don't care," said Isabel, looking at Mr. Bantling, whom she had never found so interesting.</p><p>"Stay with her while I go and see," Henrietta commanded, leaving the two for a moment together.</p><p>They stood there at first in silence, and then Mr. Bantling asked Isabel how it had been on the Channel.</p><p>"Very fine. No, I believe it was very rough," she said, to hercompanion's obvious surprise. After which she added: "You've been toGardencourt, I know."</p><p>"Now how do you know that?"</p><p>"I can't tell you--except that you look like a person who has been to Gardencourt."</p><p>"Do you think I look awfully sad? It's awfully sad there, you know."</p><p>"I don't believe you ever look awfully sad. You look awfully kind,"said Isabel with a breadth that cost her no effort. It seemed to hershe should never again feel a superficial embarrassment.</p><p>Poor Mr. Bantling, however, was still in this inferior stage. Heblushed a good deal and laughed, he assured her that he was often veryblue, and that when he was blue he was awfully fierce. "You can askMiss Stackpole, you know. I was at Gardencourt two days ago."</p><p>"Did you see my cousin?"</p><p>"Only for a little. But he had been seeing people; Warburton hadbeen there the day before. Ralph was just the same as usual, exceptthat he was in bed and that he looks tremendously ill and that he can'tspeak," Mr. Bantling pursued. "He was awfully jolly and funny all thesame. He was just as clever as ever. It's awfully wretched."</p><p>Even in the crowded, noisy station this simple picture was vivid. "Was that late in the day?"</p><p>"Yes; I went on purpose. We thought you'd like to know."</p><p>"I'm greatly obliged to you. Can I go down tonight?"</p><p>"Ah, I don't think SHE'LL let you go," said Mr. Bantling. "She wantsyou to stop with her. I made Touchett's man promise to telegraph meto-day, and I found the telegram an hour ago at my club. 'Quiet andeasy,' that's what it says, and it's dated two o'clock. So you see youcan wait till to-morrow. You must be awfully tired."</p><p>"Yes, I'm awfully tired. And I thank you again."</p><p>"Oh," said Mr. Bantling, "We were certain you would like the lastnews." On which Isabel vaguely noted that he and Henrietta seemed afterall to agree. Miss Stackpole came back with Isabel's maid, whom she hadcaught in the act of proving her utility. This excellent person,instead of losing herself in the crowd, had simply attended to hermistress's luggage, so that the latter was now at liberty to leave thestation. "You know you're not to think of going to the countryto-night," Henrietta remarked to her. "It doesn't matter whetherthere's a train or not. You're to come straight to me in WimpoleStreet. There isn't a corner to be had in London, but I've got you oneall the same. It isn't a Roman palace, but it will do for a night."</p><p>"I'll do whatever you wish," Isabel said.</p><p>"You'll come and answer a few questions; that's what I wish."</p><p>"She doesn't say anything about dinner, does she, Mrs. Osmond?" Mr. Bantling enquired jocosely.</p><p>Henrietta fixed him a moment with her speculative gaze. "I seeyou're in a great hurry to get your own. You'll be at the PaddingtonStation to-morrow morning at ten."</p><p>"Don't come for my sake, Mr. Bantling," said Isabel.</p><p>"He'll come for mine," Henrietta declared as she ushered her friendinto a cab. And later, in a large dusky parlour in Wimpole Street--todo her justice there had been dinner enough--she asked those questionsto which she had alluded at the station. "Did your husband make you ascene about your coming?" That was Miss Stackpole's first enquiry.</p><p>"No; I can't say he made a scene."</p><p>"He didn't object then?"</p><p>"Yes, he objected very much. But it was not what you'd call a scene."</p><p>"What was it then?"</p><p>"It was a very quiet conversation."</p><p>Henrietta for a moment regarded her guest. "It must have beenhellish," she then remarked. And Isabel didn't deny that it had beenhellish. But she confined herself to answering Henrietta's questions,which was easy, as they were tolerably definite. For the present sheoffered her no new information. "Well," said Miss Stackpole at last,"I've only one criticism to make. I don't see why you promised littleMiss Osmond to go back."</p><p>"I'm not sure I myself see now," Isabel replied. "But I did then."</p><p>"If you've forgotten your reason perhaps you won't return."</p><p>Isabel waited a moment. "Perhaps I shall find another."</p><p>"You'll certainly never find a good one."</p><p>"In default of a better my having promised will do," Isabel suggested.</p><p>"Yes; that's why I hate it."</p><p>"Don't speak of it now. I've a little time. Coming away was a complication, but what will going back be?"</p><p>"You must remember, after all, that he won't make you a scene!" said Henrietta with much intention.</p><p>"He will, though," Isabel answered gravely. "It won't be the scene of a moment; it will be a scene of the rest of my life."</p><p>For some minutes the two women sat and considered this remainder,and then Miss Stackpole, to change the subject, as Isabel hadrequested, announced abruptly: "I've been to stay with Lady Pensil!"</p><p>"Ah, the invitation came at last!"</p><p>"Yes; it took five years. But this time she wanted to see me."</p><p>"Naturally enough."</p><p>"It was more natural than I think you know," said Henrietta, whofixed her eyes on a distant point. And then she added, turningsuddenly: "Isabel Archer, I beg your pardon. You don't know why?Because I criticised you, and yet I've gone further than you. Mr.Osmond, at least, was born on the other side!"</p><p>It was a moment before Isabel grasped her meaning; this sense was somodestly, or at least so ingeniously, veiled. Isabel's mind was notpossessed at present with the comicality of things; but she greetedwith a quick laugh the image that her companion had raised. Sheimmediately recovered herself, however, and with the right excess ofintensity, "Henrietta Stackpole," she asked, "are you going to give upyour country?"</p><p>"Yes, my poor Isabel, I am. I won't pretend to deny it; I look thefact: in the face. I'm going to marry Mr. Bantling and locate righthere in London."</p><p>"It seems very strange," said Isabel, smiling now.</p><p>"Well yes, I suppose it does. I've come to it little by little. Ithink I know what I'm doing; but I don't know as I can explain."</p><p>"One can't explain one's marriage," Isabel answered. "And yours doesn't need to be explained. Mr. Bantling isn't a riddle."</p><p>"No, he isn't a bad pun--or even a high flight of American humour.He has a beautiful nature," Henrietta went on. "I've studied him formany years and I see right through him. He's as clear as the style of agood prospectus. He's not intellectual, but he appreciates intellect.On the other hand he doesn't exaggerate its claims. I sometimes thinkwe do in the United States."</p><p>"Ah," said Isabel, "you're changed indeed! It's the first time I've ever heard you say anything against your native land."</p><p>"I only say that we're too infatuated with mere brain-power; that,after all, isn't a vulgar fault. But I AM changed; a woman has tochange a good deal to marry."</p><p>"I hope you'll be very happy. You will at last--over here--see something of the inner life."</p><p>Henrietta gave a little significant sigh. "That's the key to themystery, I believe. I couldn't endure to be kept off. Now I've as gooda right as any one!" she added with artless elation. Isabel was dulydiverted, but there was a certain melancholy in her view. Henrietta,after all, had confessed herself human and feminine, Henrietta whom shehad hitherto regarded as a light keen flame, a disembodied voice. Itwas a disappointment to find she had personal susceptibilities, thatshe was subject to common passions, and that her intimacy with Mr.Bantling had not been completely original. There was a want oforiginality in her marrying him--there was even a kind of stupidity;and for a moment, to Isabel's sense, the dreariness of the world tookon a deeper tinge. A little later indeed she reflected that Mr.Bantling himself at least was original. But she didn't see howHenrietta could give up her country. She herself had relaxed her holdof it, but it had never been her country as it had been Henrietta's.She presently asked her if she had enjoyed her visit to Lady Pensil.</p><p>"Oh yes," said Henrietta, "she didn't know what to make of me."</p><p>"And was that very enjoyable?"</p><p>"Very much so, because she's supposed to be a master mind. Shethinks she knows everything; but she doesn't understand a woman of mymodern type. It would be so much easier for her if I were only a littlebetter or a little worse. She's so puzzled; I believe she thinks it'smy duty to go and do something immoral. She thinks it's immoral that Ishould marry her brother; but, after all, that isn't immoral enough.And she'll never understand my mixture--never!"</p><p>"She's not so intelligent as her brother then," said Isabel. "He appears to have understood."</p><p>"Oh no, he hasn't!" cried Miss Stackpole with decision. "I reallybelieve that's what he wants to marry me for--just to find out themystery and the proportions of it. That's a fixed idea--a kind offascination."</p><p>"It's very good in you to humour it."</p><p>"Oh well," said Henrietta, "I've something to find out too!" AndIsabel saw that she had not renounced an allegiance, but planned anattack. She was at last about to grapple in earnest with England.</p><p>Isabel also perceived, however, on the morrow, at the PaddingtonStation, where she found herself, at ten o'clock, in the company bothof Miss Stackpole and Mr. Bantling, that the gentleman bore hisperplexities lightly. If he had not found out everything he had foundout at least the great point--that Miss Stackpole would not be wantingin initiative. It was evident that in the selection of a wife he hadbeen on his guard against this deficiency.</p><p>"Henrietta has told me, and I'm very glad," Isabel said as she gave him her hand.</p><p>"I dare say you think it awfully odd," Mr. Bantling replied, resting on his neat umbrella.</p><p>"Yes, I think it awfully odd."</p><p>"You can't think it so awfully odd as I do. But I've always rather liked striking out a line," said Mr. Bantling serenely.</p></span><span id = 1003 ><p>Isabel's arrival at Gardencourt on this second occasion was evenquieter than it had been on the first. Ralph Touchett kept but a smallhousehold, and to the new servants Mrs. Osmond was a stranger; so thatinstead of being conducted to her own apartment she was coldly showninto the drawing-room and left to wait while her name was carried up toher aunt. She waited a long time; Mrs. Touchett appeared in no hurry tocome to her. She grew impatient at last; she grew nervous andscared--as scared as if the objects about her had begun to show forconscious things, watching her trouble with grotesque grimaces. The daywas dark and cold; the dusk was thick in the corners of the wide brownrooms. The house was perfectly still--with a stillness that Isabelremembered; it had filled all the place for days before the death ofher uncle. She left the drawing-room and wandered about--strolled intothe library and along the gallery of pictures, where, in the deepsilence, her footstep made an echo. Nothing was changed; she recognisedeverything she had seen years before; it might have been only yesterdayshe had stood there. She envied the security of valuable "pieces" whichchange by no hair's breadth, only grow in value, while their ownerslose inch by inch youth, happiness, beauty; and she became aware thatshe was walking about as her aunt had done on the day she had come tosee her in Albany. She was changed enough since then--that had been thebeginning. It suddenly struck her that if her Aunt Lydia had not comethat day in just that way and found her alone, everything might havebeen different. She might have had another life and she might have beena woman more blest. She stopped in the gallery in front of a smallpicture--a charming and precious Bonington--upon which her eyes resteda long time. But she was not looking at the picture; she was wonderingwhether if her aunt had not come that day in Albany she would havemarried Caspar Goodwood.</p><p>Mrs. Touchett appeared at last, just after Isabel had returned tothe big uninhabited drawing-room. She looked a good deal older, but hereye was as bright as ever and her head as erect; her thin lips seemed arepository of latent meanings. She wore a little grey dress of the mostundecorated fashion, and Isabel wondered, as she had wondered the firsttime, if her remarkable kinswoman resembled more a queen-regent or thematron of a gaol. Her lips felt very thin indeed on Isabel's hot cheek.</p><p>"I've kept you waiting because I've been sitting with Ralph," Mrs.Touchett said. "The nurse had gone to luncheon and I had taken herplace. He has a man who's supposed to look after him, but the man'sgood for nothing; he's always looking out of the window--as if therewere anything to see! I didn't wish to move, because Ralph seemed to besleeping and I was afraid the sound would disturb him. I waited tillthe nurse came back. I remembered you knew the house."</p><p>"I find I know it better even than I thought; I've been walkingeverywhere," Isabel answered. And then she asked if Ralph slept much.</p><p>"He lies with his eyes closed; he doesn't move. But I'm not sure that it's always sleep."</p><p>"Will he see me? Can he speak to me?"</p><p>Mrs. Touchett declined the office of saying. "You can try him," wasthe limit of her extravagance. And then she offered to conduct Isabelto her room. "I thought they had taken you there; but it's not myhouse, it's Ralph's; and I don't know what they do. They must at leasthave taken your luggage; I don't suppose you've brought much. Not thatI care, however. I believe they've given you the same room you hadbefore; when Ralph heard you were coming he said you must have thatone."</p><p>"Did he say anything else?"</p><p>"Ah, my dear, he doesn't chatter as he used!" cried Mrs. Touchett as she preceded her niece up the staircase.</p><p>It was the same room, and something told Isabel it had not beenslept in since she occupied it. Her luggage was there and was notvoluminous; Mrs. Touchett sat down a moment with her eyes upon it. "Isthere really no hope?" our young woman asked as she stood before her.</p><p>"None whatever. There never has been. It has not been a successful life."</p><p>"No--it has only been a beautiful one." Isabel found herself already contradicting her aunt; she was irritated by her dryness.</p><p>"I don't know what you mean by that; there's no beauty without health. That is a very odd dress to travel in."</p><p>Isabel glanced at her garment. "I left Rome at an hour's notice; I took the first that came."</p><p>"Your sisters, in America, wished to know how you dress. That seemedto be their principal interest. I wasn't able to tell them --but theyseemed to have the right idea: that you never wear anything less thanblack brocade."</p><p>"They think I'm more brilliant than I am; I'm afraid to tell themthe truth," said Isabel. "Lily wrote me you had dined with her."</p><p>"She invited me four times, and I went once. After the second timeshe should have let me alone. The dinner was very good; it must havebeen expensive. Her husband has a very bad manner. Did I enjoy my visitto America? Why should I have enjoyed it? I didn't go for my pleasure."</p><p>These were interesting items, but Mrs. Touchett soon left her niece,whom she was to meet in half an hour at the midday meal. For thisrepast the two ladies faced each other at an abbreviated table in themelancholy dining-room. Here, after a little, Isabel saw her aunt notto be so dry as she appeared, and her old pity for the poor woman'sinexpressiveness, her want of regret, of disappointment, came back toher. Unmistakeably she would have found it a blessing to-day to be ableto feel a defeat, a mistake, even a shame or two. She wondered if shewere not even missing those enrichments of consciousness and privatelytrying-- reaching out for some aftertaste of life, dregs of thebanquet; the testimony of pain or the cold recreation of remorse. Onthe other hand perhaps she was afraid; if she should begin to knowremorse at all it might take her too far. Isabel could perceive,however, how it had come over her dimly that she had failed ofsomething, that she saw herself in the future as an old woman withoutmemories. Her little sharp face looked tragical. She told her niecethat Ralph had as yet not moved, but that he probably would be able tosee her before dinner. And then in a moment she added that he had seenLord Warburton the day before; an announcement which startled Isabel alittle, as it seemed an intimation that this personage was in theneighbourhood and that an accident might bring them together. Such anaccident would not be happy; she had not come to England to struggleagain with Lord Warburton. She none the less presently said to her auntthat he had been very kind to Ralph; she had seen something of that inRome.</p><p>"He has something else to think of now," Mrs. Touchett returned. And she paused with a gaze like a gimlet.</p><p>Isabel saw she meant something, and instantly guessed what shemeant. But her reply concealed her guess; her heart beat faster and shewished to gain a moment. "Ah yes--the House of Lords and all that."</p><p>"He's not thinking of the Lords; he's thinking of the ladies. Atleast he's thinking of one of them; he told Ralph he's engaged to bemarried."</p><p>"Ah, to be married!" Isabel mildly exclaimed.</p><p>"Unless he breaks it off. He seemed to think Ralph would like toknow. Poor Ralph can't go to the wedding, though I believe it's to takeplace very soon.</p><p>"And who's the young lady?"</p><p>"A member of the aristocracy; Lady Flora, Lady Felicia-- something of that sort."</p><p>"I'm very glad," Isabel said. "It must be a sudden decision."</p><p>"Sudden enough, I believe; a courtship of three weeks. It has only just been made public."</p><p>"I'm very glad," Isabel repeated with a larger emphasis. She knewher aunt was watching her--looking for the signs of some imputedsoreness, and the desire to prevent her companion from seeing anythingof this kind enabled her to speak in the tone of quick satisfaction,the tone almost of relief. Mrs. Touchett of course followed thetradition that ladies, even married ones, regard the marriage of theirold lovers as an offence to themselves. Isabel's first care thereforewas to show that however that might be in general she was not offendednow. But meanwhile, as I say, her heart beat faster; and if she sat forsome moments thoughtful --she presently forgot Mrs. Touchett'sobservation--it was not because she had lost an admirer. Herimagination had traversed half Europe; it halted, panting, and eventrembling a little, in the city of Rome. She figured herself announcingto her husband that Lord Warburton was to lead a bride to the altar,and she was of course not aware how extremely wan she must have lookedwhile she made this intellectual effort. But at last she collectedherself and said to her aunt: "He was sure to do it some time or other."</p><p>Mrs. Touchett was silent; then she gave a sharp little shake of thehead. "Ah, my dear, you're beyond me!" she cried suddenly. They went onwith their luncheon in silence; Isabel felt as if she had heard of LordWarburton's death. She had known him only as a suitor, and now that wasall over. He was dead for poor Pansy; by Pansy he might have lived. Aservant had been hovering about; at last Mrs. Touchett requested him toleave them alone. She had finished her meal; she sat with her handsfolded on the edge of the table. "I should like to ask you threequestions," she observed when the servant had gone.</p><p>"Three are a great many."</p><p>"I can't do with less; I've been thinking. They're all very good ones."</p><p>"That's what I'm afraid of. The best questions are the worst,"Isabel answered. Mrs. Touchett had pushed back her chair, and as herniece left the table and walked, rather consciously, to one of the deepwindows, she felt herself followed by her eyes.</p><p>"Have you ever been sorry you didn't marry Lord Warburton?" Mrs. Touchett enquired.</p><p>Isabel shook her head slowly, but not heavily. "No, dear aunt."</p><p>"Good. I ought to tell you that I propose to believe what you say."</p><p>"Your believing me's an immense temptation," she declared, smiling still.</p><p>"A temptation to lie? I don't recommend you to do that, for when I'mmisinformed I'm as dangerous as a poisoned rat. I don't mean to crowover you."</p><p>"It's my husband who doesn't get on with me," said Isabel.</p><p>"I could have told him he wouldn't. I don't call that crowing overYOU," Mrs. Touchett added. "Do you still like Serena Merle?" she wenton.</p><p>"Not as I once did. But it doesn't matter, for she's going to America."</p><p>"To America? She must have done something very bad."</p><p>"Yes--very bad."</p><p>"May I ask what it is?"</p><p>"She made a convenience of me."</p><p>"Ah," cried Mrs. Touchett, "so she did of me! She does of every one."</p><p>"She'll make a convenience of America," said Isabel, smiling again and glad that her aunt's questions were over.</p><p>It was not till the evening that she was able to see Ralph. He hadbeen dozing all day; at least he had been lying unconscious. The doctorwas there, but after a while went away--the local doctor, who hadattended his father and whom Ralph liked. He came three or four times aday; he was deeply interested in his patient. Ralph had had Sir MatthewHope, but he had got tired of this celebrated man, to whom he had askedhis mother to send word he was now dead and was therefore withoutfurther need of medical advice. Mrs. Touchett had simply written to SirMatthew that her son disliked him. On the day of Isabel's arrival Ralphgave no sign, as I have related, for many hours; but toward evening heraised himself and said he knew that she had come.</p><p>How he knew was not apparent, inasmuch as for fear of exciting himno one had offered the information. Isabel came in and sat by his bedin the dim light; there was only a shaded candle in a corner of theroom. She told the nurse she might go--she herself would sit with himfor the rest of the evening. He had opened his eyes and recognised her,and had moved his hand, which lay helpless beside him, so that shemight take it. But he was unable to speak; he closed his eyes again andremained perfectly still, only keeping her hand in his own. She satwith him a long time-- till the nurse came back; but he gave no furthersign. He might have passed away while she looked at him; he was alreadythe figure and pattern of death. She had thought him far gone in Rome,and this was worse; there was but one change possible now. There was astrange tranquillity in his face; it was as still as the lid of a box.With this he was a mere lattice of bones; when he opened his eyes togreet her it was as if she were looking into immeasurable space. It wasnot till midnight that the nurse came back; but the hours, to Isabel,had not seemed long; it was exactly what she had come for. If she hadcome simply to wait she found ample occasion, for he lay three days ina kind of grateful silence. He recognised her and at moments seemed towish to speak; but he found no voice. Then he closed his eyes again, asif he too were waiting for something--for something that certainlywould come. He was so absolutely quiet that it seemed to her what wascoming had already arrived; and yet she never lost the sense that theywere still together. But they were not always together; there wereother hours that she passed in wandering through the empty house andlistening for a voice that was not poor Ralph's. She had a constantfear; she thought it possible her husband would write to her. But heremained silent, and she only got a letter from Florence and from theCountess Gemini. Ralph, however, spoke at last--on the evening of thethird day.</p><p>"I feel better to-night," he murmured, abruptly, in the soundlessdimness of her vigil; "I think I can say something." She sank upon herknees beside his pillow; took his thin hand in her own; begged him notto make an effort--not to tire himself. His face was of necessityserious--it was incapable of the muscular play of a smile; but itsowner apparently had not lost a perception of incongruities. "What doesit matter if I'm tired when I've all eternity to rest? There's no harmin making an effort when it's the very last of all. Don't people alwaysfeel better just before the end? I've often heard of that; it's what Iwas waiting for. Ever since you've been here I thought it would come. Itried two or three times; I was afraid you'd get tired of sittingthere." He spoke slowly, with painful breaks and long pauses; his voiceseemed to come from a distance. When he ceased he lay with his faceturned to Isabel and his large unwinking eyes open into her own. "Itwas very good of you to come," he went on. "I thought you would; but Iwasn't sure."</p><p>"I was not sure either till I came," said Isabel.</p><p>"You've been like an angel beside my bed. You know they talk aboutthe angel of death. It's the most beautiful of all. You've been likethat; as if you were waiting for me."</p><p>"I was not waiting for your death; I was waiting for--for this. This is not death, dear Ralph."</p><p>"Not for you--no. There's nothing makes us feel so much alive as tosee others die. That's the sensation of life--the sense that we remain.I've had it--even I. But now I'm of no use but to give it to others.With me it's all over." And then he paused. Isabel bowed her headfurther, till it rested on the two hands that were clasped upon hisown. She couldn't see him now; but his far-away voice was close to herear. "Isabel," he went on suddenly, "I wish it were over for you." Sheanswered nothing; she had burst into sobs; she remained so, with herburied face. He lay silent, listening to her sobs; at last he gave along groan. "Ah, what is it you have done for me?"</p><p>"What is it you did for me?" she cried, her now extreme agitationhalf smothered by her attitude. She had lost all her shame, all wish tohide things. Now he must know; she wished him to know, for it broughtthem supremely together, and he was beyond the reach of pain. "You didsomething once--you know it. O Ralph, you've been everything! What haveI done for you--what can I do to-day? I would die if you could live.But I don't wish you to live; I would die myself, not to lose you." Hervoice was as broken as his own and full of tears and anguish.</p><p>"You won't lose me--you'll keep me. Keep me in your heart; I shallbe nearer to you than I've ever been. Dear Isabel, life is better; forin life there's love. Death is good--but there's no love."</p><p>"I never thanked you--I never spoke--I never was what I should be!"Isabel went on. She felt a passionate need to cry out and accuseherself, to let her sorrow possess her. All her troubles, for themoment, became single and melted together into this present pain. "Whatmust you have thought of me? Yet how could I know? I never knew, and Ionly know to-day because there are people less stupid than I."</p><p>"Don't mind people," said Ralph. "I think I'm glad to leave people."</p><p>She raised her head and her clasped hands; she seemed for a moment to pray to him. "Is it true--is it true?" she asked.</p><p>"True that you've been stupid? Oh no," said Ralph with a sensible intention of wit.</p><p>"That you made me rich--that all I have is yours?"</p><p>He turned away his head, and for some time said nothing. Then atlast: "Ah, don't speak of that--that was not happy." Slowly he movedhis face toward her again, and they once more saw each other. "But forthat--but for that--!" And he paused. "I believe I ruined you," hewailed.</p><p>She was full of the sense that he was beyond the reach of pain; heseemed already so little of this world. But even if she had not had itshe would still have spoken, for nothing mattered now but the onlyknowledge that was not pure anguish--the knowledge that they werelooking at the truth together.</p><p>"He married me for the money," she said. She wished to sayeverything; she was afraid he might die before she had done so. Hegazed at her a little, and for the first time his fixed eyes loweredtheir lids. But he raised them in a moment, and then, "He was greatlyin love with you," he answered.</p><p>"Yes, he was in love with me. But he wouldn't have married me if Ihad been poor. I don't hurt you in saying that. How can I? I only wantyou to understand. I always tried to keep you from understanding; butthat's all over."</p><p>"I always understood," said Ralph.</p><p>"I thought you did, and I didn't like it. But now I like it."</p><p>"You don't hurt me--you make me very happy." And as Ralph said thisthere was an extraordinary gladness in his voice. She bent her headagain, and pressed her lips to the back of his hand. "I alwaysunderstood," he continued, "though it was so strange--so pitiful. Youwanted to look at life for yourself--but you were not allowed; you werepunished for your wish. You were ground in the very mill of theconventional!"</p><p>"Oh yes, I've been punished," Isabel sobbed.</p><p>He listened to her a little, and then continued: "Was he very bad about your coming?"</p><p>"He made it very hard for me. But I don't care."</p><p>"It is all over then between you?"</p><p>"Oh no; I don't think anything's over."</p><p>"Are you going back to him&nbsp;?" Ralph gasped.</p><p>"I don't know--I can't tell. I shall stay here as long as I may. Idon't want to think--I needn't think. I don't care for anything butyou, and that's enough for the present. It will last a little yet. Hereon my knees, with you dying in my arms, I'm happier than I have beenfor a long time. And I want you to be happy-- not to think of anythingsad; only to feel that I'm near you and I love you. Why should there bepain--? In such hours as this what have we to do with pain? That's notthe deepest thing; there's something deeper."</p><p>Ralph evidently found from moment to moment greater difficulty inspeaking; he had to wait longer to collect himself. At first heappeared to make no response to these last words; he let a long timeelapse. Then he murmured simply: "You must stay here."</p><p>"I should like to stay--as long as seems right."</p><p>"As seems right-- as seems right?" He repeated her words. "Yes, you think a great deal about that."</p><p>"Of course one must. You're very tired," said Isabel.</p><p>"I'm very tired. You said just now that pain's not the deepest thing. No--no. But it's very deep. If I could stay--"</p><p>"For me you'll always be here," she softly interrupted. It was easy to interrupt him.</p><p>But he went on, after a moment: "It passes, after all; it's passingnow. But love remains. I don't know why we should suffer so much.Perhaps I shall find out. There are many things in life. You're veryyoung."</p><p>"I feel very old," said Isabel.</p><p>"You'll grow young again. That's how I see you. I don't believe-- Idon't believe--" But he stopped again; his strength failed him.</p><p>She begged him to be quiet now. "We needn't speak to understand each other," she said.</p><p>"I don't believe that such a generous mistake as yours can hurt you for more than a little."</p><p>"Oh Ralph, I'm very happy now," she cried through her tears.</p><p>"And remember this," he continued, "that if you've been hated you'vealso been loved. Ah but, Isabel--ADORED!" he just audibly andlingeringly breathed.</p><p>"Oh my brother!" she cried with a movement of still deeper prostration.</p></span><span id = 1004 ><p>He had told her, the first evening she ever spent at Gardencourt,that if she should live to suffer enough she might some day see theghost with which the old house was duly provided. She apparently hadfulfilled the necessary condition; for the next morning, in the cold,faint dawn, she knew that a spirit was standing by her bed. She hadlain down without undressing, it being her belief that Ralph would notoutlast the night. She had no inclination to sleep; she was waiting,and such waiting was wakeful. But she closed her eyes; she believedthat as the night wore on she should hear a knock at her door. Sheheard no knock, but at the time the darkness began vaguely to grow greyshe started up from her pillow as abruptly as if she had received asummons. It seemed to her for an instant that he was standing there--avague, hovering figure in the vagueness of the room. She stared amoment; she saw his white face--his kind eyes; then she saw there wasnothing. She was not afraid; she was only sure. She quitted the placeand in her certainty passed through dark corridors and down a flight ofoaken steps that shone in the vague light of a hall-window. OutsideRalph's door she stopped a moment, listening, but she seemed to hearonly the hush that filled it. She opened the door with a hand as gentleas if she were lifting a veil from the face of the dead, and saw Mrs.Touchett sitting motionless and upright beside the couch of her son,with one of his hands in her own. The doctor was on the other side,with poor Ralph's further wrist resting in his professional fingers.The two nurses were at the foot between them. Mrs. Touchett took nonotice of Isabel, but the doctor looked at her very hard; then hegently placed Ralph's hand in a proper position, close beside him. Thenurse looked at her very hard too, and no one said a word; but Isabelonly looked at what she had come to see. It was fairer than Ralph hadever been in life, and there was a strange resemblance to the face ofhis father, which, six years before, she had seen lying on the samepillow. She went to her aunt and put her arm around her; and Mrs.Touchett, who as a general thing neither invited nor enjoyed caresses,submitted for a moment to this one, rising, as might be, to take it.But she was stiff and dry-eyed; her acute white face was terrible.</p><p>"Dear Aunt Lydia," Isabel murmured.</p><p>"Go and thank God you've no child," said Mrs. Touchett, disengaging herself.</p><p>Three days after this a considerable number of people found time, atthe height of the London "season," to take a morning train down to aquiet station in Berkshire and spend half an hour in a small greychurch which stood within an easy walk. It was in the greenburial-place of this edifice that Mrs. Touchett consigned her son toearth. She stood herself at the edge of the grave, and Isabel stoodbeside her; the sexton himself had not a more practical interest in thescene than Mrs. Touchett. It was a solemn occasion, but neither a harshnor a heavy one; there was a certain geniality in the appearance ofthings. The weather had changed to fair; the day, one of the last ofthe treacherous May-time, was warm and windless, and the air had thebrightness of the hawthorn and the blackbird. If it was sad to think ofpoor Touchett, it was not too sad, since death, for him, had had noviolence. He had been dying so long; he was so ready; everything hadbeen so expected and prepared. There were tears in Isabel's eyes, butthey were not tears that blinded. She looked through them at the beautyof the day, the splendour of nature, the sweetness of the old Englishchurchyard, the bowed heads of good friends. Lord Warburton was there,and a group of gentlemen all unknown to her, several of whom, as sheafterwards learned, were connected with the bank; and there were otherswhom she knew. Miss Stackpole was among the first, with honest Mr.Bantling beside her; and Caspar Goodwood, lifting his head higher thanthe rest--bowing it rather less. During much of the time Isabel wasconscious of Mr. Goodwood's gaze; he looked at her somewhat harder thanhe usually looked in public, while the others had fixed their eyes uponthe churchyard turf. But she never let him see that she saw him; shethought of him only to wonder that he was still in England. She foundshe had taken for granted that after accompanying Ralph to Gardencourthe had gone away; she remembered how little it was a country thatpleased him. He was there, however, very distinctly there; andsomething in his attitude seemed to say that he was there with acomplex intention. She wouldn't meet his eyes, though there wasdoubtless sympathy in them; he made her rather uneasy. With thedispersal of the little group he disappeared, and the only person whocame to speak to her--though several spoke to Mrs. Touchett--wasHenrietta Stackpole. Henrietta had been crying.</p><p>Ralph had said to Isabel that he hoped she would remain atGardencourt, and she made no immediate motion to leave the place. Shesaid to herself that it was but common charity to stay a little withher aunt. It was fortunate she had so good a formula; otherwise shemight have been greatly in want of one. Her errand was over; she haddone what she had left her husband to do. She had a husband in aforeign city, counting the hours of her absence; in such a case oneneeded an excellent motive. He was not one of the best husbands, butthat didn't alter the case. Certain obligations were involved in thevery fact of marriage, and were quite independent of the quantity ofenjoyment extracted from it. Isabel thought of her husband as little asmight be; but now that she was at a distance, beyond its spell, shethought with a kind of spiritual shudder of Rome. There was apenetrating chill in the image, and she drew back into the deepestshade of Gardencourt. She lived from day to day, postponing, closingher eyes, trying not to think. She knew she must decide, but shedecided nothing; her coming itself had not been a decision. On thatoccasion she had simply started. Osmond gave no sound and now evidentlywould give none; he would leave it all to her. From Pansy she heardnothing, but that was very simple: her father had told her not to write.</p><p>Mrs. Touchett accepted Isabel's company, but offered her noassistance; she appeared to be absorbed in considering, withoutenthusiasm but with perfect lucidity, the new conveniences of her ownsituation. Mrs. Touchett was not an optimist, but even from painfuloccurrences she managed to extract a certain utility. This consisted inthe reflexion that, after all, such things happened to other people andnot to herself. Death was disagreeable, but in this case it was herson's death, not her own; she had never flattered herself that her ownwould be disagreeable to any one but Mrs. Touchett. She was better offthan poor Ralph, who had left all the commodities of life behind him,and indeed all the security; since the worst of dying was, to Mrs.Touchett's mind, that it exposed one to be taken advantage of. Forherself she was on the spot; there was nothing so good as that. Shemade known to Isabel very punctually--it was the evening her son wasburied--several of Ralph's testamentary arrangements. He had told hereverything, had consulted her about everything. He left her no money;of course she had no need of money. He left her the furniture ofGardencourt, exclusive of the pictures and books and the use of theplace for a year; after which it was to be sold. The money produced bythe sale was to constitute an endowment for a hospital for poor personssuffering from the malady of which he died; and of this portion of thewill Lord Warburton was appointed executor. The rest of his property,which was to be withdrawn from the bank, was disposed of in variousbequests, several of them to those cousins in Vermont to whom hisfather had already been so bountiful. Then there were a number of smalllegacies.</p><p>"Some of them are extremely peculiar," said Mrs. Touchett; "he hasleft considerable sums to persons I never heard of. He gave me a list,and I asked then who some of them were, and he told me they were peoplewho at various times had seemed to like him. Apparently he thought youdidn't like him, for he hasn't left you a penny. It was his opinionthat you had been handsomely treated by his father, which I'm bound tosay I think you were--though I don't mean that I ever heard himcomplain of it. The pictures are to be dispersed; he has distributedthem about, one by one, as little keepsakes. The most valuable of thecollection goes to Lord Warburton. And what do you think he has donewith his library? It sounds like a practical joke. He has left it toyour friend Miss Stackpole--'in recognition of her services toliterature.' Does he mean her following him up from Rome? Was that aservice to literature? It contains a great many rare and valuablebooks, and as she can't carry it about the world in her trunk herecommends her to sell it at auction. She will sell it of course atChristie's, and with the proceeds she'll set up a newspaper. Will thatbe a service to literature?"</p><p>This question Isabel forbore to answer, as it exceeded the littleinterrogatory to which she had deemed it necessary to submit on herarrival. Besides, she had never been less interested in literature thanto-day, as she found when she occasionally took down from the shelf oneof the rare and valuable volumes of which Mrs. Touchett had spoken. Shewas quite unable to read; her attention had never been so little at hercommand. One afternoon, in the library, about a week after the ceremonyin the churchyard, she was trying to fix it for an hour; but her eyesoften wandered from the book in her hand to the open window, whichlooked down the long avenue. It was in this way that she saw a modestvehicle approach the door and perceived Lord Warburton sitting, inrather an uncomfortable attitude, in a corner of it. He had always hada high standard of courtesy, and it was therefore not remarkable, underthe circumstances, that he should have taken the trouble to come downfrom London to call on Mrs. Touchett. It was of course Mrs. Touchett hehad come to see, and not Mrs. Osmond; and to prove to herself thevalidity of this thesis Isabel presently stepped out of the house andwandered away into the park. Since her arrival at Gardencourt she hadbeen but little out of doors, the weather being unfavourable forvisiting the grounds. This evening, however, was fine, and at first itstruck her as a happy thought to have come out. The theory I have justmentioned was plausible enough, but it brought her little rest, and ifyou had seen her pacing about you would have said she had a badconscience. She was not pacified when at the end of a quarter of anhour, finding herself in view of the house, she saw Mrs. Touchettemerge from the portico accompanied by her visitor. Her aunt hadevidently proposed to Lord Warburton that they should come in search ofher. She was in no humour for visitors and, if she had had a chance,would have drawn back behind one of the great trees. But she saw shehad been seen and that nothing was left her but to advance. As the lawnat Gardencourt was a vast expanse this took some time; during which sheobserved that, as he walked beside his hostess, Lord Warburton kept hishands rather stiffly behind him and his eyes upon the ground. Bothpersons apparently were silent; but Mrs. Touchett's thin little glance,as she directed it toward Isabel, had even at a distance an expression.It seemed to say with cutting sharpness: "Here's the eminently amenablenobleman you might have married!" When Lord Warburton lifted his owneyes, however, that was not what they said. They only said "This israther awkward, you know, and I depend upon you to help me." He wasvery grave, very proper and, for the first time since Isabel had knownhim, greeted her without a smile. Even in his days of distress he hadalways begun with a smile. He looked extremely selfconscious.</p><p>"Lord Warburton has been so good as to come out to see me," saidMrs. Touchett. "He tells me he didn't know you were still here. I knowhe's an old friend of yours, and as I was told you were not in thehouse I brought him out to see for himself."</p><p>"Oh, I saw there was a good train at 6.40, that would get me back intime for dinner," Mrs. Touchett's companion rather irrelevantlyexplained. "I'm so glad to find you've not gone."</p><p>"I'm not here for long, you know," Isabel said with a certain eagerness.</p><p>"I suppose not; but I hope it's for some weeks. You came to England sooner than--a--than you thought?"</p><p>"Yes, I came very suddenly."</p><p>Mrs. Touchett turned away as if she were looking at the condition ofthe grounds, which indeed was not what it should be, while LordWarburton hesitated a little. Isabel fancied he had been on the pointof asking about her husband--rather confusedly--and then had checkedhimself. He continued immitigably grave, either because he thought itbecoming in a place over which death had just passed, or for morepersonal reasons. If he was conscious of personal reasons it was veryfortunate that he had the cover of the former motive; he could make themost of that. Isabel thought of all this. It was not that his face wassad, for that was another matter; but it was strangely inexpressive.</p><p>"My sisters would have been so glad to come if they had known youwere still here--if they had thought you would see them," LordWarburton went on. "Do kindly let them see you before you leaveEngland."</p><p>"It would give me great pleasure; I have such a friendly recollection of them."</p><p>"I don't know whether you would come to Lockleigh for a day or two?You know there's always that old promise." And his lordship coloured alittle as he made this suggestion, which gave his face a somewhat morefamiliar air. "Perhaps I'm not right in saying that just now; of courseyou're not thinking of visiting. But I meant what would hardly be avisit. My sisters are to be at Lockleigh at Whitsuntide for five days;and if you could come then--as you say you're not to be very long inEngland--I would see that there should be literally no one else."</p><p>Isabel wondered if not even the young lady he was to marry would be there with her mamma; but she did not express this idea.</p><p>"Thank you extremely," she contented herself with saying; "I'm afraid I hardly know about Whitsuntide."</p><p>"But I have your promise--haven't I?--for some other time."</p><p>There was an interrogation in this; but Isabel let it pass. Shelooked at her interlocutor a moment, and the result of her observationwas that--as had happened before--she felt sorry for him. "Take careyou don't miss your train," she said. And then she added: "I wish youevery happiness."</p><p>He blushed again, more than before, and he looked at his watch. "Ahyes, 6.40; I haven't much time, but I've a fly at the door. Thank youvery much." It was not apparent whether the thanks applied to herhaving reminded him of his train or to the more sentimental remark."Good-bye, Mrs. Osmond; good-bye." He shook hands with her, withoutmeeting her eyes, and then he turned to Mrs. Touchett, who had wanderedback to them. With her his parting was equally brief; and in a momentthe two ladies saw him move with long steps across the lawn.</p><p>"Are you very sure he's to be married?" Isabel asked of her aunt.</p><p>"I can't be surer than he; but he seems sure. I congratulated him, and he accepted it."</p><p>"Ah," said Isabel, "I give it up!"--while her aunt returned to thehouse and to those avocations which the visitor had interrupted.</p><p>She gave it up, but she still thought of it--thought of it while shestrolled again under the great oaks whose shadows were long upon theacres of turf. At the end of a few minutes she found herself near arustic bench, which, a moment after she had looked at it, struck her asan object recognised. It was not simply that she had seen it before,nor even that she had sat upon it; it was that on this spot somethingimportant had happened to her--that the place had an air ofassociation. Then she remembered that she had been sitting there, sixyears before, when a servant brought her from the house the letter inwhich Caspar Goodwood informed her that he had followed her to Europe;and that when she had read the letter she looked up to hear LordWarburton announcing that he should like to marry her. It was indeed anhistorical, an interesting, bench; she stood and looked at it as if itmight have something to say to her. She wouldn't sit down on it now--she felt rather afraid of it. She only stood before it, and while shestood the past came back to her in one of those rushing waves ofemotion by which persons of sensibility are visited at odd hours. Theeffect of this agitation was a sudden sense of being very tired, underthe influence of which she overcame her scruples and sank into therustic seat. I have said that she was restless and unable to occupyherself; and whether or no, if you had seen her there, you would haveadmired the justice of the former epithet, you would at least haveallowed that at this moment she was the image of a victim of idleness.Her attitude had a singular absence of purpose; her hands, hanging ather sides, lost themselves in the folds of her black dress; her eyesgazed vaguely before her. There was nothing to recall her to the house;the two ladies, in their seclusion, dined early and had tea at anindefinite hour. How long she had sat in this position she could nothave told you; but the twilight had grown thick when she became awarethat she was not alone. She quickly straightened herself, glancingabout, and then saw what had become of her solitude. She was sharing itwith Caspar Goodwood, who stood looking at her, a few yards off, andwhose footfall on the unresonant turf, as he came near, she had notheard. It occurred to her in the midst of this that it was just so LordWarburton had surprised her of old.</p><p>She instantly rose, and as soon as Goodwood saw he was seen hestarted forward. She had had time only to rise when, with a motion thatlooked like violence, but felt like--she knew not what, he grasped herby the wrist and made her sink again into the seat. She closed hereyes; he had not hurt her; it was only a touch, which she had obeyed.But there was something in his face that she wished not to see. Thatwas the way he had looked at her the other day in the churchyard; onlyat present it was worse. He said nothing at first; she only felt himclose to her--beside her on the bench and pressingly turned to her. Italmost seemed to her that no one had ever been so close to her as that.All this, however, took but an instant, at the end of which she haddisengaged her wrist, turning her eyes upon her visitant. "You'vefrightened me," she said.</p><p>"I didn't mean to," he answered, "but if I did a little, no matter.I came from London a while ago by the train, but I couldn't come heredirectly. There was a man at the station who got ahead of me. He took afly that was there, and I heard him give the order to drive here. Idon't know who he was, but I didn't want to come with him; I wanted tosee you alone. So I've been waiting and walking about. I've walked allover, and I was just coming to the house when I saw you here. There wasa keeper, or someone, who met me; but that was all right, because I hadmade his acquaintance when I came here with your cousin. Is thatgentleman gone? Are you really alone? I want to speak to you." Goodwoodspoke very fast; he was as excited as when they had parted in Rome.Isabel had hoped that condition would subside; and she shrank intoherself as she perceived that, on the contrary, he had only let outsail. She had a new sensation; he had never produced it before; it wasa feeling of danger. There was indeed something really formidable inhis resolution. She gazed straight before her; he, with a hand on eachknee, leaned forward, looking deeply into her face. The twilight seemedto darken round them. "I want to speak to you," he repeated; "I'vesomething particular to say. I don't want to trouble you--as I did theother day in Rome. That was of no use; it only distressed you. Icouldn't help it; I knew I was wrong. But I'm not wrong now; pleasedon't think I am," he went on with his hard, deep voice melting amoment into entreaty. "I came here to-day for a purpose. It's verydifferent. It was vain for me to speak to you then; but now I can helpyou."</p><p>She couldn't have told you whether it was because she was afraid, orbecause such a voice in the darkness seemed of necessity a boon; butshe listened to him as she had never listened before; his words droppeddeep into her soul. They produced a sort of stillness in all her being;and it was with an effort, in a moment, that she answered him. "How canyou help me?" she asked in a low tone, as if she were taking what hehad said seriously enough to make the enquiry in confidence.</p><p>"By inducing you to trust me. Now I know--to-day I know. Do youremember what I asked you in Rome? Then I was quite in the dark. Butto-day I know on good authority; everything's clear to me to-day. Itwas a good thing when you made me come away with your cousin. He was agood man, a fine man, one of the best; he told me how the case standsfor you. He explained everything; he guessed my sentiments. He was amember of your family and he left you--so long as you should be inEngland--to my care," said Goodwood as if he were making a great point."Do you know what he said to me the last time I saw him--as he laythere where he died? He said: 'Do everything you can for her; doeverything she'll let you.'"</p><p>Isabel suddenly got up. "You had no business to talk about me!"</p><p>"Why not--why not, when we talked in that way?" he demanded,following her fast. "And he was dying--when a man's dying it'sdifferent." She checked the movement she had made to leave him; she waslistening more than ever; it was true that he was not the same as thatlast time. That had been aimless, fruitless passion, but at present hehad an idea, which she scented in all her being. "But it doesn'tmatter!" he exclaimed, pressing her still harder, though now withouttouching a hem of her garment. "If Touchett had never opened his mouthI should have known all the same. I had only to look at you at yourcousin's funeral to see what's the matter with you. You can't deceiveme any more; for God's sake be honest with a man who's so honest withyou. You're the most unhappy of women, and your husband's the deadliestof fiends."</p><p>She turned on him as if he had struck her. "Are you mad?" she cried.</p><p>"I've never been so sane; I see the whole thing. Don't think it'snecessary to defend him. But I won't say another word against him; I'llspeak only of you," Goodwood added quickly. "How can you pretend you'renot heart-broken? You don't know what to do-- you don't know where toturn. It's too late to play a part; didn't you leave all that behindyou in Rome? Touchett knew all about it, and I knew it too--what itwould cost you to come here. It will have cost you your life? Say itwill"--and he flared almost into anger: "give me one word of truth!When I know such a horror as that, how can I keep myself from wishingto save you? What would you think of me if I should stand still and seeyou go back to your reward? 'It's awful, what she'll have to pay forit!'--that's what Touchett said to me. I may tell you that, mayn't I?He was such a near relation!" cried Goodwood, making his queer grimpoint again. "I'd sooner have been shot than let another man say thosethings to me; but he was different; he seemed to me to have the right.It was after he got home--when he saw he was dying, and when I saw ittoo. I understand all about it: you're afraid to go back. You'reperfectly alone; you don't know where to turn. You can't turn anywhere;you know that perfectly. Now it is therefore that I want you to thinkof ME."</p><p>"To think of 'you'?" Isabel said, standing before him in the dusk.The idea of which she had caught a glimpse a few moments before nowloomed large. She threw back her head a little; she stared at it as ifit had been a comet in the sky.</p><p>"You don't know where to turn. Turn straight to me. I want topersuade you to trust me," Goodwood repeated. And then he paused withhis shining eyes. "Why should you go back--why should you go throughthat ghastly form?"</p><p>"To get away from you!" she answered. But this expressed only alittle of what she felt. The rest was that she had never been lovedbefore. She had believed it, but this was different; this was the hotwind of the desert, at the approach of which the others dropped dead,like mere sweet airs of the garden. It wrapped her about; it lifted heroff her feet, while the very taste of it, as of something potent, acridand strange, forced open her set teeth.</p><p>At first, in rejoinder to what she had said, it seemed to her thathe would break out into greater violence. But after an instant he wasperfectly quiet; he wished to prove he was sane, that he had reasonedit all out. "I want to prevent that, and I think I may, if you'll onlyfor once listen to me. It's too monstrous of you to think of sinkingback into that misery, of going to open your mouth to that poisonedair. It's you that are out of your mind. Trust me as if I had the careof you. Why shouldn't we be happy--when it's here before us, when it'sso easy? I'm yours for ever--for ever and ever. Here I stand; I'm asfirm as a rock. What have you to care about? You've no children; thatperhaps would be an obstacle. As it is you've nothing to consider. Youmust save what you can of your life; you mustn't lose it all simplybecause you've lost a part. It would be an insult to you to assume thatyou care for the look of the thing, for what people will say, for thebottomless idiocy of the world. We've nothing to do with all that;we're quite out of it; we look at things as they are. You took thegreat step in coming away; the next is nothing; it's the natural one. Iswear, as I stand here, that a woman deliberately made to suffer isjustified in anything in life--in going down into the streets if thatwill help her! I know how you suffer, and that's why I'm here. We cando absolutely as we please; to whom under the sun do we owe anything?What is it that holds us, what is it that has the smallest right tointerfere in such a question as this? Such a question is betweenourselves--and to say that is to settle it! Were we born to rot in ourmisery--were we born to be afraid? I never knew YOU afraid! If you'llonly trust me, how little you will be disappointed! The world's allbefore us--and the world's very big. I know something about that."</p><p>Isabel gave a long murmur, like a creature in pain; it was as if he were pressing something that hurt her.</p><p>"The world's very small," she said at random; she had an immensedesire to appear to resist. She said it at random, to hear herself saysomething; but it was not what she meant. The world, in truth, hadnever seemed so large; it seemed to open out, all round her, to takethe form of a mighty sea, where she floated in fathomless waters. Shehad wanted help, and here was help; it had come in a rushing torrent. Iknow not whether she believed everything he said; but she believed justthen that to let him take her in his arms would be the next best thingto her dying. This belief, for a moment, was a kind of rapture, inwhich she felt herself sink and sink. In the movement she seemed tobeat with her feet, in order to catch herself, to feel something torest on.</p><p>"Ah, be mine as I'm yours!" she heard her companion cry. He hadsuddenly given up argument, and his voice seemed to come, harsh andterrible, through a confusion of vaguer sounds.</p><p>This however, of course, was but a subjective fact, as themetaphysicians say; the confusion, the noise of waters, all the rest ofit, were in her own swimming head. In an instant she became aware ofthis. "Do me the greatest kindness of all," she panted. "I beseech youto go away!"</p><p>"Ah, don't say that. Don't kill me!" he cried.</p><p>She clasped her hands; her eyes were streaming with tears. "As you love me, as you pity me, leave me alone!"</p><p>He glared at her a moment through the dusk, and the next instant shefelt his arms about her and his lips on her own lips. His kiss was likewhite lightning, a flash that spread, and spread again, and stayed; andit was extraordinarily as if, while she took it, she felt each thing inhis hard manhood that had least pleased her, each aggressive fact ofhis face, his figure, his presence, justified of its intense identityand made one with this act of possession. So had she heard of thosewrecked and under water following a train of images before they sink.But when darkness returned she was free. She never looked about her;she only darted from the spot. There were lights in the windows of thehouse; they shone far across the lawn. In an extraordinarily shorttime--for the distance was considerable-- she had moved through thedarkness (for she saw nothing) and reached the door. Here only shepaused. She looked all about her; she listened a little; then she puther hand on the latch. She had not known where to turn; but she knewnow. There was a very straight path.</p><p>Two days afterwards Caspar Goodwood knocked at the door of the housein Wimpole Street in which Henrietta Stackpole occupied furnishedlodgings. He had hardly removed his hand from the knocker when the doorwas opened and Miss Stackpole herself stood before him. She had on herhat and jacket; she was on the point of going out. "Oh, good-morning,"he said, "I was in hopes I should find Mrs. Osmond."</p><p>Henrietta kept him waiting a moment for her reply; but there was agood deal of expression about Miss Stackpole even when she was silent."Pray what led you to suppose she was here?"</p><p>"I went down to Gardencourt this morning, and the servant told me she had come to London. He believed she was to come to you."</p><p>Again Miss Stackpole held him--with an intention of perfectkindness--in suspense. "She came here yesterday, and spent the night.But this morning she started for Rome."</p><p>Caspar Goodwood was not looking at her; his eyes were fastened onthe doorstep. "Oh, she started--?" he stammered. And without finishinghis phrase or looking up he stiffly averted himself. But he couldn'totherwise move.</p><p>Henrietta had come out, closing the door behind her, and now she putout her hand and grasped his arm. "Look here, Mr. Goodwood," she said;"just you wait!"</p><p>On which he looked up at her--but only to guess, from her face, witha revulsion, that she simply meant he was young. She stood shining athim with that cheap comfort, and it added, on the spot, thirty years tohis life. She walked him away with her, however, as if she had givenhim now the key to patience.</p></span>
