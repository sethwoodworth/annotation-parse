<h2 id="id00258" style="margin-top: 3em">THE VISION OF SUDDEN DEATH.</h2>



<p id="id00259" style="margin-top: 2em">[THE reader is to understand this present paper, in its two sections of

<i>The Vision</i>, &amp;c., and <i>The Dream-Fugue</i>, as connected with a previous

paper on <i>The English Mail-Coach</i>. The ultimate object was the Dream-Fugue,

as an attempt to wrestle with the utmost efforts of music in dealing with

a colossal form of impassioned horror. The Vision of Sudden Death contains

the mail-coach incident, which did really occur, and did really suggest

the variations of the Dream, here taken up by the Fugue, as well as other

variations not now recorded. Confluent with these impressions, from the

terrific experience on the Manchester and Glasgow mail, were other and more

general impressions, derived from long familiarity with the English mail,

as developed in the former paper; impressions, for instance, of animal

beauty and power, of rapid motion, at that time unprecedented, of

connection with the government and public business of a great nation, but,

above all, of connection with the national victories at an unexampled

crisis,&mdash;the mail being the privileged organ for publishing and dispersing

all news of that kind. From this function of the mail, arises naturally the

introduction of Waterloo into the fourth variation of the Fogue; for the

mail itself having been carried into the dreams by the incident in the

Vision, naturally all the accessory circumstances of pomp and grandeur

investing this national carriage followed in the train of the principal

image.]</p>



<p id="id00260">What is to be thought of sudden death? It is remarkable that, in different

conditions of society it has been variously regarded as the consummation of

an earthly career most fervently to be desired, and, on the other hand,

as that consummation which is most of all to be deprecated. Cæsar the

Dictator, at his last dinner party, (<i>coena</i>,) and the very evening before

his assassination, being questioned as to the mode of death which, in <i>his</i>

opinion, might seem the most eligible, replied&mdash;"That which should be most

sudden." On the other hand, the divine Litany of our English Church, when

breathing forth supplications, as if in some representative character for

the whole human race prostrate before God, places such a death in the very

van of horrors. "From lightning and tempest; from plague, pestilence, and

famine; from battle and murder, and from sudden death,&mdash;<i>Good Lord, deliver

us</i>." Sudden death is here made to crown the climax in a grand ascent of

calamities; it is the last of curses; and yet, by the noblest of Romans,

it was treated as the first of blessings. In that difference, most readers

will see little more than the difference between Christianity and Paganism.

But there I hesitate. The Christian church may be right in its estimate of

sudden death; and it is a natural feeling, though after all it may also

be an infirm one, to wish for a quiet dismissal from life&mdash;as that which

<i>seems</i> most reconcilable with meditation, with penitential retrospects,

and with the humilities of farewell prayer. There does not, however, occur

to me any direct scriptural warrant for this earnest petition of the

English Litany. It seems rather a petition indulged to human infirmity,

than exacted from human piety. And, however <i>that</i> may be, two remarks

suggest themselves as prudent restraints upon a doctrine, which else <i>may</i>

wander, and <i>has</i> wandered, into an uncharitable superstition. The first

is this: that many people are likely to exaggerate the horror of a sudden

death, (I mean the <i>objective</i> horror to him who contemplates such a

death, not the <i>subjective</i> horror to him who suffers it,) from the false

disposition to lay a stress upon words or acts, simply because by an

accident they have become words or acts. If a man dies, for instance,

by some sudden death when he happens to be intoxicated, such a death is

falsely regarded with peculiar horror; as though the intoxication were

suddenly exalted into a blasphemy. But <i>that</i> is unphilosophic. The man

was, or he was not, <i>habitually</i> a drunkard. If not, if his intoxication

were a solitary accident, there can be no reason at all for allowing

special emphasis to this act, simply because through misfortune it became

his final act. Nor, on the other hand, if it were no accident, but one of

his <i>habitual</i> transgressions, will it be the more habitual or the more a

transgression, because some sudden calamity, surprising him, has caused

this habitual transgression to be also a final one? Could the man have had

any reason even dimly to foresee his own sudden death, there would have

been a new feature in his act of intemperance&mdash;a feature of presumption and

irreverence, as in one that by possibility felt himself drawing near to the

presence of God. But this is no part of the case supposed. And the only new

element in the man's act is not any element of extra immorality, but simply

of extra misfortune.</p>



<p id="id00261">The other remark has reference to the meaning of the word <i>sudden</i>. And it

is a strong illustration of the duty which for ever calls us to the stern

valuation of words&mdash;that very possibly Cæesar and the Christian church do

not differ in the way supposed; that is, do not differ by any difference

of doctrine as between Pagan and Christian views of the moral temper

appropriate to death, but that they are contemplating different cases.

Both contemplate a violent death; a [Greek: biathanatos]&mdash;death that

is [Greek: biaios]: but the difference is&mdash;that the Roman by the word

"sudden" means an <i>unlingering</i> death: whereas the Christian Litany

by "sudden" means a death <i>without warning</i>, consequently without any

available summons to religious preparation. The poor mutineer, who kneels

down to gather into his heart the bullets from twelve firelocks of his

pitying comrades, dies by a most sudden death in Cæsar's sense: one shock,

one mighty spasm, one (possibly <i>not</i> one) groan, and all is over. But,

in the sense of the Litany, his death is far from sudden; his offence,

originally, his imprisonment, his trial, the interval between his sentence

and its execution, having all furnished him with separate warnings of his

fate&mdash;having all summoned him to meet it with solemn preparation.</p>



<p id="id00262">Meantime, whatever may be thought of a sudden death as a mere variety in

the modes of dying, where death in some shape is inevitable&mdash;a question

which, equally in the Roman and the Christian sense, will be variously

answered according to each man's variety of temperament&mdash;certainly, upon

one aspect of sudden death there can be no opening for doubt, that of all

agonies incident to man it is the most frightful, that of all martyrdoms it

is the most freezing to human sensibilities&mdash;namely, where it surprises a

man under circumstances which offer (or which seem to offer) some hurried

and inappreciable chance of evading it. Any effort, by which such an

evasion can be accomplished, must be as sudden as the danger which it

affronts. Even <i>that</i>, even the sickening necessity for hurrying in

extremity where all hurry seems destined to be vain, self-baffled, and

where the dreadful knell of <i>too</i> late is already sounding in the ears by

anticipation&mdash;even that anguish is liable to a hideous exasperation in one

particular case, namely, where the agonising appeal is made not exclusively

to the instinct of self-preservation, but to the conscience, on behalf of

another life besides your own, accidentally cast upon <i>your</i> protection. To

fail, to collapse in a service merely your own, might seem comparatively

venial; though, in fact, it is far from venial. But to fail in a case where

Providence has suddenly thrown into your hands the final interests of

another&mdash;of a fellow-creature shuddering between the gates of life and

death; this, to a man of apprehensive conscience, would mingle the misery

of an atrocious criminality with the misery of a bloody calamity. The man

is called upon, too probably, to die; but to die at the very moment when,

by any momentary collapse, he is self-denounced as a murderer. He had but

the twinkling of an eye for his effort, and that effort might, at the best,

have been unavailing; but from this shadow of a chance, small or great, how

if he has recoiled by a treasonable <i>lâcheté</i>? The effort <i>might</i> have been

without hope; but to have risen to the level of that effort, would have

rescued him, though not from dying, yet from dying as a traitor to his

duties.</p>



<p id="id00263">The situation here contemplated exposes a dreadful ulcer, lurking far down

in the depths of human nature. It is not that men generally are summoned

to face such awful trials. But potentially, and in shadowy outline, such

a trial is moving subterraneously in perhaps all men's natures&mdash;muttering

under ground in one world, to be realized perhaps in some other. Upon the

secret mirror of our dreams such a trial is darkly projected at intervals,

perhaps, to every one of us. That dream, so familiar to childhood, of

meeting a lion, and, from languishing prostration in hope and vital energy,

that constant sequel of lying down before him, publishes the secret

frailty of human nature&mdash;reveals its deep-seated Pariah falsehood to

itself&mdash;records its abysmal treachery. Perhaps not one of us escapes that

dream; perhaps, as by some sorrowful doom of man, that dream repeats for

every one of us, through every generation, the original temptation in Eden.

Every one of us, in this dream, has a bait offered to the infirm places of

his own individual will; once again a snare is made ready for leading him

into captivity to a luxury of ruin; again, as in aboriginal Paradise, the

man falls from innocence; once again, by infinite iteration, the ancient

Earth groans to God, through her secret caves, over the weakness of her

child; "Nature, from her seat, sighing through all her works," again "gives

signs of woe that all is lost;" and again the counter sigh is repeated to

the sorrowing heavens of the endless rebellion against God. Many people

think that one man, the patriarch of our race, could not in his single

person execute this rebellion for all his race. Perhaps they are wrong.

But, even if not, perhaps in the world of dreams every one of us ratifies

for himself the original act. Our English rite of "Confirmation," by which,

in years of awakened reason, we take upon us the engagements contracted

for us in our slumbering infancy,&mdash;how sublime a rite is that! The little

postern gate, through which the baby in its cradle had been silently placed

for a time within the glory of God's countenance, suddenly rises to the

clouds as a triumphal arch, through which, with banners displayed and

martial pomps, we make our second entry as crusading soldiers militant

for God, by personal choice and by sacramental oath. Each man says in

effect&mdash;"Lo! I rebaptise myself; and that which once was sworn on my

behalf, now I swear for myself." Even so in dreams, perhaps, under some

secret conflict of the midnight sleeper, lighted up to the consciousness

at the time, but darkened to the memory as soon as all is finished, each

several child of our mysterious race completes for himself the aboriginal

fall.</p>



<p id="id00264">As I drew near to the Manchester post office, I found that it was

considerably past midnight; but to my great relief, as it was important for

me to be in Westmorland by the morning, I saw by the huge saucer eyes of

the mail, blazing through the gloom of overhanging houses, that my chance

was not yet lost. Past the time it was; but by some luck, very unusual in

my experience, the mail was not even yet ready to start. I ascended to

my seat on the box, where my cloak was still lying as it had lain at

the Bridgewater Arms. I had left it there in imitation of a nautical

discoverer, who leaves a bit of bunting on the shore of his discovery, by

way of warning off the ground the whole human race, and signalising to the

Christian and the heathen worlds, with his best compliments, that he has

planted his throne for ever upon that virgin soil: henceforward claiming

the <i>jus dominii</i> to the top of the atmosphere above it, and also the right

of driving shafts to the centre of the earth below it; so that all people

found after this warning, either aloft in the atmosphere, or in the

shafts, or squatting on the soil, will be treated as trespassers&mdash;that is,

decapitated by their very faithful and obedient servant, the owner of the

said bunting. Possibly my cloak might not have been respected, and the <i>jus

gentium</i> might have been cruelly violated in my person&mdash;for, in the dark,

people commit deeds of darkness, gas being a great ally of morality&mdash;but it

so happened that, on this night, there was no other outside passenger;

and the crime, which else was but too probable, missed fire for want of

a criminal. By the way, I may as well mention at this point, since a

circumstantial accuracy is essential to the effect of my narrative, that

there was no other person of any description whatever about the mail&mdash;the

guard, the coachman, and myself being allowed for&mdash;except only one&mdash;a

horrid creature of the class known to the world as insiders, but whom young

Oxford called sometimes "Trojans," in opposition to our Grecian selves, and

sometimes "vermin." A Turkish Effendi, who piques himself on good breeding,

will never mention by name a pig. Yet it is but too often that he has

reason to mention this animal; since constantly, in the streets of

Stamboul, he has his trousers deranged or polluted by this vile creature

running between his legs. But under any excess of hurry he is always

careful, out of respect to the company he is dining with, to suppress the

odious name, and to call the wretch "that other creature," as though all

animal life beside formed one group, and this odious beast (to whom, as

Chrysippus observed, salt serves as an apology for a soul) formed another

and alien group on the outside of creation. Now I, who am an English

Effendi, that think myself to understand good-breeding as well as any son

of Othman, beg my reader's pardon for having mentioned an insider by his

gross natural name. I shall do so no more; and, if I should have occasion

to glance at so painful a subject, I shall always call him "that other

creature." Let us hope, however, that no such distressing occasion will

arise. But, by the way, an occasion arises at this moment; for the reader

will be sure to ask, when we come to the story, "Was this other creature

present?" He was <i>not</i>; or more correctly, perhaps, <i>it</i> was not. We

dropped the creature&mdash;or the creature, by natural imbecility, dropped

itself&mdash;within the first ten miles from Manchester. In the latter case, I

wish to make a philosophic remark of a moral tendency. When I die, or when

the reader dies, and by repute suppose of fever, it will never be known

whether we died in reality of the fever or of the doctor. But this other

creature, in the case of dropping out of the coach, will enjoy a coroner's

inquest; consequently he will enjoy an epitaph. For I insist upon it, that

the verdict of a coroner's jury makes the best of epitaphs. It is brief, so

that the public all find time to read; it is pithy, so that the surviving

friends (if any <i>can</i> survive such a loss) remember it without fatigue; it

is upon oath, so that rascals and Dr. Johnsons cannot pick holes in it.

"Died through the visitation of intense stupidity, by impinging on a

moonlight night against the off hind wheel of the Glasgow mail! Deodand

upon the said wheel&mdash;two-pence." What a simple lapidary inscription! Nobody

much in the wrong but an off-wheel; and with few acquaintances; and if it

were but rendered into choice Latin, though there would be a little bother

in finding a Ciceronian word for "off-wheel," Marcellus himself, that great

master of sepulchral eloquence, could not show a better. Why I call this

little remark <i>moral</i>, is, from the compensation it points out. Here, by

the supposition, is that other creature on the one side, the beast of the

world; and he (or it) gets an epitaph. You and I, on the contrary, the

pride of our friends, get none.</p>



<p id="id00265">But why linger on the subject of vermin? Having mounted the box, I took a

small quantity of laudanum, having already travelled two hundred and fifty

miles&mdash;viz., from a point seventy miles beyond London, upon a simple

breakfast. In the taking of laudanum there was nothing extraordinary. But

by accident it drew upon me the special attention of my assessor on the

box, the coachman. And in <i>that</i> there was nothing extraordinary. But by

accident, and with great delight, it drew my attention to the fact that

this coachman was a monster in point of size, and that he had but one eye.

In fact he had been foretold by Virgil as&mdash;</p>



<p id="id00266">  "Monstrum. horrendum, informe, ingens cui lumen adempium."</p>



<p id="id00267">He answered in every point&mdash;a monster he was&mdash;dreadful, shapeless, huge,

who had lost an eye. But why should <i>that</i> delight me? Had he been one of

the Calendars in the Arabian Nights, and had paid down his eye as the price

of his criminal curiosity, what right had I to exult in his misfortune? I

did <i>not</i> exult: I delighted in no man's punishment, though it were even

merited. But these personal distinctions identified in an instant an old

friend of mine, whom I had known in the south for some years as the most

masterly of mail-coachmen. He was the man in all Europe that could best

have undertaken to drive six-in-hand full gallop over <i>Al Sirat</i>&mdash;that

famous bridge of Mahomet across the bottomless gulf, backing himself

against the Prophet and twenty such fellows. I used to call him <i>Cyclops

mastigophorus</i>, Cyclops the whip-bearer, until I observed that his skill

made whips useless, except to fetch off an impertinent fly from a leader's

head; upon which I changed his Grecian name to Cyclops <i>diphrélates</i>

(Cyclops the charioteer.) I, and others known to me, studied under him the

diphrelatic art. Excuse, reader, a word too elegant to be pedantic. And

also take this remark from me, as a <i>gage d'amitié</i>&mdash;that no word ever

was or <i>can</i> be pedantic which, by supporting a distinction, supports the

accuracy of logic; or which fills up a chasm for the understanding. As a

pupil, though I paid extra fees, I cannot say that I stood high in

his esteem. It showed his dogged honesty, (though, observe, not his

discernment,) that he could not see my merits. Perhaps we ought to excuse

his absurdity in this particular by remembering his want of an eye. <i>That</i>

made him blind to my merits. Irritating as this blindness was, (surely

it could not be envy?) he always courted my conversation, in which art I

certainly had the whip-hand of him. On this occasion, great joy was at our

meeting. But what was Cyclops doing here? Had the medical men recommended

northern air, or how? I collected, from such explanations as he

volunteered, that he had an interest at stake in a suit-at-law pending at

Lancaster; so that probably he had got himself transferred to this station,

for the purpose of connecting with his professional pursuits an instant

readiness for the calls of his lawsuit.</p>



<p id="id00268">Meantime, what are we stopping for? Surely, we've been waiting long enough.

Oh, this procrastinating mail, and oh this procrastinating post-office!

Can't they take a lesson upon that subject from <i>me</i>? Some people have

called <i>me</i> procrastinating. Now you are witness, reader, that I was in

time for <i>them</i>. But can <i>they</i> lay their hands on their hearts, and say

that they were in time for me? I, during my life, have often had to wait

for the post-office; the post-office never waited a minute for me. What are

they about? The guard tells me that there is a large extra accumulation of

foreign mails this night, owing to irregularities caused by war and by the

packet service, when as yet nothing is done by steam. For an <i>extra</i> hour,

it seems, the post-office has been engaged in threshing out the pure

wheaten correspondence of Glasgow, and winnowing it from the chaff of all

baser intermediate towns. We can hear the flails going at this moment. But

at last all is finished. Sound your horn, guard. Manchester, good bye;

we've lost an hour by your criminal conduct at the post-office; which,

however, though I do not mean to part with a serviceable ground of

complaint, and one which really is such for the horses, to me secretly is

an advantage, since it compels us to recover this last hour amongst the

next eight or nine. Off we are at last, and at eleven miles an hour; and at

first I detect no changes in the energy or in the skill of Cyclops.</p>



<p id="id00269">From Manchester to Kendal, which virtually (though not in law) is the

capital of Westmoreland, were at this time seven stages of eleven miles

each. The first five of these, dated from Manchester, terminated in

Lancaster, which was therefore fifty-five miles north of Manchester, and

the same distance exactly from Liverpool. The first three terminated in

Preston, (called, by way of distinction from other towns of that name,

<i>proud</i> Preston,) at which place it was that the separate roads from

Liverpool and from Manchester to the north became confluent. Within these

first three stages lay the foundation, the progress, and termination of our

night's adventure. During the first stage, I found out that Cyclops was

mortal: he was liable to the shocking affection of sleep&mdash;a thing which I

had never previously suspected. If a man is addicted to the vicious habit

of sleeping, all the skill in aurigation of Apollo himself, with the horses

of Aurora to execute the motions of his will, avail him nothing. "Oh,

Cyclops!" I exclaimed more than once, "Cyclops, my friend; thou art mortal.

Thou snorest." Through this first eleven miles, however, he betrayed

his infirmity&mdash;which I grieve to say he shared with the whole Pagan

Pantheon&mdash;only by short stretches. On waking up, he made an apology for

himself, which, instead of mending the matter, laid an ominous foundation

for coming disasters. The summer assizes were now proceeding at Lancaster:

in consequence of which, for three nights and three days, he had not lain

down in a bed. During the day, he was waiting for his uncertain summons as

a witness on the trial in which he was interested; or he was drinking with

the other witnesses, under the vigilant surveillance of the attorneys.

During the night, or that part of it when the least temptations existed to

conviviality, he was driving. Throughout the second stage he grew more and

more drowsy. In the second mile of the third stage, he surrendered himself

finally and without a struggle to his perilous temptation. All his past

resistance had but deepened the weight of this final oppression. Seven

atmospheres of sleep seemed resting upon him; and, to consummate the case,

our worthy guard, after singing "Love amongst the Roses," for the fiftieth

or sixtieth time, without any invitation from Cyclops or myself, and

without applause for his poor labors, had moodily resigned himself to

slumber&mdash;not so deep doubtless as the coachman's, but deep enough for

mischief; and having, probably, no similar excuse. And thus at last, about

ten miles from Preston, I found myself left in charge of his Majesty's

London and Glasgow mail, then running about eleven miles an hour.</p>



<p id="id00270">What made this negligence less criminal than else it must have been

thought, was the condition of the roads at night during the assizes. At

that time all the law business of populous Liverpool, and of populous

Manchester, with its vast cincture of populous rural districts, was called

up by ancient usage to the tribunal of Lilliputian Lancaster. To break up

this old traditional usage required a conflict with powerful established

interests, a large system of new arrangements, and a new parliamentary

statute. As things were at present, twice in the year so vast a body of

business rolled northwards, from the southern quarter of the county, that

a fortnight at least occupied the severe exertions of two judges for its

dispatch. The consequence of this was&mdash;that every horse available for such

a service, along the whole line of road, was exhausted in carrying down the

multitudes of people who were parties to the different suits. By sunset,

therefore, it usually happened that, through utter exhaustion amongst

men and horses, the roads were all silent. Except exhaustion in the vast

adjacent county of York from a contested election, nothing like it was

ordinarily witnessed in England.</p>



<p id="id00271">On this occasion, the usual silence and solitude prevailed along the road.

Not a hoof nor a wheel was to be heard. And to strengthen this false

luxurious confidence in the noiseless roads, it happened also that the

night was one of peculiar solemnity and peace. I myself, though slightly

alive to the possibilities of peril, had so far yielded to the influence of

the mighty calm as to sink into a profound reverie. The month was August,

in which lay my own birth-day; a festival to every thoughtful man

suggesting solemn and often sigh-born thoughts.[1] The county was my own

native county&mdash;upon which, in its southern section, more than upon any

equal area known to man past or present, had descended the original curse

of labour in its heaviest form, not mastering the bodies of men only as of

slaves, or criminals in mines, but working through the fiery will. Upon no

equal space of earth, was, or ever had been, the same energy of human

power put forth daily. At this particular season also of the assizes, that

dreadful hurricane of flight and pursuit, as it might have seemed to a

stranger, that swept to and from Lancaster all day long, hunting the

county up and down, and regularly subsiding about sunset, united with the

permanent distinction of Lancashire as the very metropolis and citadel of

labour, to point the thoughts pathetically upon that counter vision of

rest, of saintly repose from strife and sorrow, towards which, as to their

secret haven, the profounder aspirations of man's heart are continually

travelling. Obliquely we were nearing the sea upon our left, which also

must, under the present circumstances, be repeating the general state of

halcyon repose. The sea, the atmosphere, the light, bore an orchestral part

in this universal lull. Moonlight, in the first timid tremblings of the

dawn, were now blending: and the blendings were brought into a still more

exquisite state of unity, by a slight silvery mist, motionless and dreamy,

that covered the woods and fields, but with a veil of equable transparency.

Except the feet of our own horses, which, running on a sandy margin of the

road, made little disturbance, there was no sound abroad. In the clouds,

and on the earth, prevailed the same majestic peace; and in spite of all

that the villain of a schoolmaster has done for the ruin of our sublimer

thoughts, which are the thoughts of our infancy, we still believe in no

such nonsense as a limited atmosphere. Whatever we may swear with our false

feigning lips, in our faithful hearts we still believe, and must for ever

believe, in fields of air traversing the total gulf between earth and the

central heavens. Still, in the confidence of children that tread without

fear <i>every</i> chamber in their father's house, and to whom no door is

closed, we, in that Sabbatic vision which sometimes is revealed for an hour

upon nights like this, ascend with easy steps from the sorrow-stricken

fields of earth, upwards to the sandals of God.</p>



<p id="id00272">[Footnote 1: "Sigh-born:" I owe the suggestion of this word to an obscure

remembrance of a beautiful phrase in Giraldus Gambrensis, viz., <i>suspiriosæ

cogilationes</i>.]</p>



<p id="id00273">Suddenly from thoughts like these, I was awakened to a sullen sound, as

of some motion on the distant road. It stole upon the air for a moment; I

listened in awe; but then it died away. Once roused, however, I could not

but observe with alarm the quickened motion of our horses. Ten years'

experience had made my eye learned in the valuing of motion; and I saw that

we were now running thirteen miles an hour. I pretend to no presence of

mind. On the contrary, my fear is, that I am miserably and shamefully

deficient in that quality as regards action. The palsy of doubt and

distraction hangs like some guilty weight of dark unfathomed remembrances

upon my energies, when the signal is flying for <i>action</i>. But, on the other

hand, this accursed gift I have, as regards <i>thought</i>, that in the first

step towards the possibility of a misfortune, I see its total evolution: in

the radix I see too certainly and too instantly its entire expansion; in

the first syllable of the dreadful sentence, I read already the last. It

was not that I feared for ourselves. What could injure <i>us</i>? Our bulk and

impetus charmed us against peril in any collision. And I had rode through

too many hundreds of perils that were frightful to approach, that were

matter of laughter as we looked back upon them, for any anxiety to rest

upon <i>our</i> interests. The mail was not built, I felt assured, nor bespoke,

that could betray <i>me</i> who trusted to its protection. But any carriage that

we could meet would be frail and light in comparison of ourselves. And I

remarked this ominous accident of our situation. We were on the wrong side

of the road. But then the other party, if other there was, might also be on

the wrong side; and two wrongs might make a right. <i>That</i> was not likely.

The same motive which had drawn <i>us</i> to the right-hand side of the road,

viz., the soft beaten sand, as contrasted with the paved centre, would

prove attractive to others. Our lamps, still lighted, would give the

impression of vigilance on our part. And every creature that met us, would

rely upon <i>us</i> for quartering.[1] All this, and if the separate links of

the anticipation had been a thousand times more, I saw&mdash;not discursively or

by effort&mdash;but as by one flash of horrid intuition.</p>



<p id="id00274">[Footnote 1: "<i>Quartering</i>"&mdash;this is the technical word; and, I presume

derived from the French <i>carlayer</i>, to evade a rut or any obstacle.]</p>



<p id="id00275">Under this steady though rapid anticipation of the evil which <i>might</i> be

gathering ahead, ah, reader! what a sullen mystery of fear, what a sigh of

woe, seemed to steal upon the air, as again the far-off sound of a

wheel was heard! A whisper it was&mdash;a whisper from, perhaps, four miles

off&mdash;secretly announcing a ruin that, being foreseen, was not the less

inevitable. What could be done&mdash;who was it that could do it&mdash;to check the

storm-flight of these maniacal horses? What! could I not seize the reins

from the grasp of the slumbering coachman? You, reader, think that it would

have been in <i>your</i> power to do so. And I quarrel not with your estimate of

yourself. But, from the way in which the coachman's hand was viced between

his upper and lower thigh, this was impossible. The guard subsequently

found it impossible, after this danger had passed. Not the grasp only, but

also the position of this Polyphemus, made the attempt impossible. You

still think otherwise. See, then, that bronze equestrian statue. The cruel

rider has kept the bit in his horse's mouth for two centuries. Unbridle

him, for a minute, if you please, and wash his mouth with water. Or stay,

reader, unhorse me that marble emperor; knock me those marble feet from

those marble stirrups of Charlemagne.</p>



<p id="id00276">The sounds ahead strengthened, and were now too clearly the sounds of

wheels. Who and what could it be? Was it industry in a taxed cart? Was it

youthful gaiety in a gig? Whoever it was, something must be attempted to

warn them. Upon the other party rests the active responsibility, but upon

<i>us</i>&mdash;and, woe is me! that <i>us</i> was my single self&mdash;rest the responsibility

of warning. Yet, how should this be accomplished? Might I not seize the

guard's horn? Already, on the first thought, I was making my way over the

roof to the guard's seat. But this, from the foreign mails being piled upon

the roof, was a difficult, and even dangerous attempt, to one cramped by

nearly three hundred miles of outside travelling. And, fortunately, before

I had lost much time in the attempt, our frantic horses swept round an

angle of the road, which opened upon us the stage where the collision must

be accomplished, the parties that seemed summoned to the trial, and the

impossibility of saving them by any communication with the guard.</p>



<p id="id00277">Before us lay an avenue, straight as an arrow, six hundred yards, perhaps,

in length; and the umbrageous trees, which rose in a regular line from

either side, meeting high overhead, gave to it the character of a cathedral

aisle. These trees lent a deeper solemnity to the early light; but there

was still light enough to perceive, at the further end of this gothic

aisle, a light, reedy gig, in which were seated a young man, and, by his

side, a young lady. Ah, young sir! what are you about? If it is necessary

that you should whisper your communications to this young lady&mdash;though

really I see nobody at this hour, and on this solitary road, likely to

overhear your conversation&mdash;is it, therefore, necessary that you should

carry your lips forward to hers? The little carriage is creeping on at one

mile an hour; and the parties within it, being thus tenderly engaged, are

naturally bending down their heads. Between them and eternity, to all human

calculation, there is but a minute and a half. What is it that I shall do?

Strange it is, and to a mere auditor of the tale, might seem laughable,

that I should need a suggestion from the <i>Iliad</i> to prompt the sole

recourse that remained. But so it was. Suddenly I remembered the shout of

Achilles, and its effect. But could I pretend to shout like the son of

Peleus, aided by Pallas? No, certainly: but then I needed not the shout

that should alarm all Asia militant; a shout would suffice, such as should

carry terror into the hearts of two thoughtless young people, and one

gig horse. I shouted&mdash;and the young man heard me not. A second time I

shouted&mdash;and now he heard me, for now he raised his head.</p>



<p id="id00278">Here, then, all had been done that, by me, <i>could</i> be done: more on <i>my</i>

part was not possible. Mine had been the first step: the second was for the

young man: the third was for God. If, said I, the stranger is a brave man,

and if, indeed, he loves the young girl at his side&mdash;or, loving her not, if

he feels the obligation pressing upon every man worthy to be called a man,

of doing his utmost for a woman confided to his protection&mdash;he will at

least make some effort to save her. If <i>that</i> fails, he will not perish the

more, or by a death more cruel, for having made it; and he will die as a

brave man should, with his face to the danger, and with his arm about the

woman that he sought in vain to save. But if he makes no effort, shrinking,

without a struggle, from his duty, he himself will not the less certainly

perish for this baseness of poltroonery. He will die no less: and why not?

Wherefore should we grieve that there is one craven less in the world? No;

<i>let</i> him perish, without a pitying thought of ours wasted upon him; and,

in that case, all our grief will be reserved for the fate of the helpless

girl, who now, upon the least shadow of failure in <i>him</i>, must, by the

fiercest of translations&mdash;must, without time for a prayer&mdash;must, within

seventy seconds, stand before the judgment-seat of God.</p>



<p id="id00279">But craven he was not: sudden had been the call upon him, and sudden was

his answer to the call. He saw, he heard, he comprehended, the ruin that

was coming down: already its gloomy shadow darkened above him; and already

he was measuring his strength to deal with it. Ah! what a vulgar thing does

courage seem, when we see nations buying it and selling it for a shilling a

day: ah! what a sublime thing does courage seem, when some fearful crisis

on the great deeps of life carries a man, as if running before a hurricane,

up to the giddy crest of some mountainous wave, from which accordingly as

he chooses his course, he describes two courses, and a voice says to him

audibly, "This way lies hope; take the other way and mourn for ever!" Yet,

even then, amidst the raving of the seas and the frenzy of the danger, the

man is able to confront his situation&mdash;is able to retire for a moment

into solitude with God, and to seek all his counsel from <i>him</i>! For seven

seconds, it might be, of his seventy, the stranger settled his countenance

steadfastly upon us, as if to search and value every element in the

conflict before him. For five seconds more he sate immovably, like one that

mused on some great purpose. For five he sate with eyes upraised, like one

that prayed in sorrow, under some extremity of doubt, for wisdom to guide

him towards the better choice. Then suddenly he rose; stood upright; and,

by a sudden strain upon the reins, raising his horse's forefeet from the

ground, he slewed him round on the pivot of his hind legs, so as to plant

the little equipage in a position nearly at right angles to ours. Thus

far his condition was not improved; except as a first step had been taken

towards the possibility of a second. If no more were done, nothing was

done; for the little carriage still occupied the very centre of our path,

though in an altered direction. Yet even now it may not be too late:

fifteen of the twenty seconds may still be unexhausted; and one almighty

bound forward may avail to clear the ground. Hurry then; hurry! for the

flying moments&mdash;<i>they</i> hurry! Oh hurry, hurry, my brave young man! for the

cruel hoofs of our horses&mdash;<i>they</i> also hurry! Fast are the flying moments,

faster are the hoofs of our horses. Fear not for <i>him</i>, if human energy can

suffice: faithful was he that drove, to his terrific duty; faithful was the

horse to <i>his</i> command. One blow, one impulse given with voice and hand by

the stranger, one rush from the horse, one bound as if in the act of rising

to a fence, landed the docile creature's forefeet upon the crown or arching

centre of the road. The larger half of the little equipage had then cleared

our over-towering shadow: <i>that</i> was evident even to my own agitated sight.

But it mattered little that one wreck should float off in safety, if upon

the wreck that perished were embarked the human freightage. The rear part

of the carriage&mdash;was <i>that</i> certainly beyond the line of absolute ruin?

What power could answer the question? Glance of eye, thought of man, wing

of angel, which of these had speed enough to sweep between the question and

the answer, and divide the one from the other? Light does not tread upon

the steps of light more indivisibly, than did our all-conquering arrival

upon the escaping efforts of the gig. <i>That</i> must the young man have felt

too plainly. His back was now turned to us; not by sight could he any

longer communicate with the peril; but by the dreadful rattle of our

harness, too truly had his ear been instructed&mdash;that all was finished as

regarded any further effort of <i>his</i>. Already in resignation he had rested

from his struggle; and perhaps, in his heart he was whispering&mdash;"Father,

which art above, do thou finish in heaven what I on earth have attempted."

We ran past them faster than ever mill-race in our inexorable flight. Oh,

raving of hurricanes that must have sounded in their young ears at the

moment of our transit! Either with the swingle-bar, or with the haunch of

our near leader, we had struck the off-wheel of the little gig, which stood

rather obliquely and not quite so far advanced as to be accurately parallel

with the near wheel. The blow, from the fury of our passage, resounded

terrifically. I rose in horror, to look upon the ruins we might have

caused. From my elevated station I looked down., and looked back upon the

scene, which in a moment told its tale, and wrote all its records on my

heart for ever.</p>



<p id="id00280">The horse was planted immovably, with his fore-feet upon the paved crest of

the central road. He of the whole party was alone untouched by the passion

of death. The little cany carriage&mdash;partly perhaps from the dreadful

torsion of the wheels in its recent movement, partly from the thundering

blow we had given to it&mdash;as if it sympathized with human horror, was all

alive with tremblings and shiverings. The young man sat like a rock. He

stirred not at all. But <i>his</i> was the steadiness of agitation frozen into

rest by horror. As yet he dared not to look round; for he knew that, if

anything remained to do, by him it could no longer be done. And as yet he

knew not for certain if their safety were accomplished. But the lady&mdash;</p>



<p id="id00281">But the lady&mdash;! Oh heavens! will that spectacle ever depart from my dreams,

as she rose and sank upon her seat, sank and rose, threw up her arms wildly

to heaven, clutched at some visionary object in the air, fainting, praying,

raving, despairing! Figure to yourself, reader, the elements of the case;

suffer me to recall before your mind the circumstances of the unparalleled

situation. From the silence and deep peace of this saintly summer

night&mdash;from the pathetic blending of this sweet moonlight, dawnlight,

dreamlight&mdash;from the manly tenderness of this flattering, whispering,

murmuring love&mdash;suddenly as from the woods and fields&mdash;suddenly as from

the chambers of the air opening in revelation&mdash;suddenly as from the ground

yawning at her feet, leaped upon her, with the flashing of cataracts, Death

the crowned phantom, with all the equipage of his terrors, and the tiger

roar of his voice.</p>



<p id="id00282">The moments were numbered. In the twinkling of an eye our flying horses had

carried us to the termination of the umbrageous aisle; at right angles we

wheeled into our former direction; the turn of the road carried the scene

out of my eyes in an instant, and swept it into my dreams for ever.</p>

<p id="id00288">Passion of Sudden Death! that once in youth I read and interpreted by the

shadows of thy averted[1] signs;&mdash;Rapture of panic taking the shape which

amongst tombs in churches I have seen, of woman bursting her sepulchral

bonds&mdash;of woman's Ionic form bending forward from the ruins of her grave

with arching foot, with eyes upraised, with clasped adoring hands&mdash;waiting,

watching, trembling, praying, for the trumpet's call to rise from dust

<p id="id00289">[Footnote 1: "<i>Averted signs</i>."&mdash;I read the course and changes of the

lady's agony in the succession of her involuntary gestures; but let it be

remembered that I read all this from the rear, never once catching the

lady's full face, and even her profile imperfectly.]</p>



<p id="id00290" style="margin-top: 2em">1.</p>



<p id="id00291">Lo, it is summer, almighty summer! The everlasting gates of life and summer

are thrown open wide; and on the ocean, tranquil and verdant as a savanna,

the unknown lady from the dreadful vision and I myself are floating: she

upon a fairy pinnace, and I upon an English three-decker. But both of

us are wooing gales of festal happiness within the domain of our common

country&mdash;within that ancient watery park&mdash;within that pathless chase where

England takes her pleasure as a huntress through winter and summer, and

which stretches from the rising to the setting sun. Ah! what a wilderness

of floral beauty was hidden, or was suddenly revealed, upon the tropic

islands, through which the pinnace moved. And upon her deck what a bevy

of human flowers&mdash;young women how lovely, young men how noble, that were

dancing together, and slowly drifting towards <i>us</i> amidst music and

incense, amidst blossoms from forests and gorgeous corymbi from vintages,

amidst natural caroling and the echoes of sweet girlish laughter. Slowly

the pinnace nears us, gaily she hails us, and slowly she disappears beneath

the shadow of our mighty bows. But then, as at some signal from heaven, the

music and the carols, and the sweet echoing of girlish laughter&mdash;all are

hushed. What evil has smitten the pinnace, meeting or overtaken her? Did

ruin to our friends couch within our own dreadful shadow? Was our shadow

the shadow of death? I looked over the bow for an answer; and, behold! the

pinnace was dismantled; the revel and the revellers were found no more; the

glory of the vintage was dust; and the forest was left without a witness to

its beauty upon the seas. "But where," and I turned to our own crew&mdash;"Where

are the lovely women that danced beneath the awning of flowers and

clustering corymbi? Whither have fled the noble young men that danced with

<i>them</i>?" Answer there was none. But suddenly the man at the mast-head,

whose countenance darkened with alarm, cried out&mdash;"Sail on the weather

beam! Down she comes upon us: in seventy seconds she will founder!"</p>



<p id="id00292" style="margin-top: 2em">2.</p>



<p id="id00293">I looked to the weather side, and the summer had departed. The sea was

rocking, and shaken with gathering wrath. Upon its surface sate mighty

mists, which grouped themselves into arches and long cathedral aisles. Down

one of these, with the fiery pace of a quarrel from a cross-bow, ran a

frigate right athwart our course. "Are they mad?" some voice exclaimed from

our deck. "Are they blind? Do they woo their ruin?" But in a moment, as she

was close upon us, some impulse of a heady current or sudden vortex gave a

wheeling bias to her course, and off she forged without a shock. As she ran

past us, high aloft amongst the shrouds stood the lady of the pinnace. The

deeps opened ahead in malice to receive her, towering surges of foam ran

after her, the billows were fierce to catch her. But far away she was borne

into desert spaces of the sea: whilst still by sight I followed her, as she

ran before the howling gale, chased by angry sea-birds and by maddening

billows; still I saw her, as at the moment when she ran past us, amongst

the shrouds, with her white draperies streaming before the wind. There

she stood with hair dishevelled, one hand clutched amongst the

tackling&mdash;rising, sinking, fluttering, trembling, praying&mdash;there for

leagues I saw her as she stood, raising at intervals one hand to heaven,

amidst the fiery crests of the pursuing waves and the raving of the storm;

until at last, upon a sound from afar of malicious laughter and mockery,

all was hidden for ever in driving showers; and afterwards, but when I know

not, and how I know not.</p>



<p id="id00294" style="margin-top: 2em">3.</p>



<p id="id00295">Sweet funeral bells from some incalculable distance, wailing over the dead

that die before the dawn, awakened me as I slept in a boat moored to some

familiar shore. The morning twilight even then was breaking; and, by the

dusky revelations which it spread, I saw a girl adorned with a garland

of white roses about her head for some great festival, running along the

solitary strand with extremity of haste. Her running was the running of

panic; and often she looked back as to some dreadful enemy in the rear. But

when I leaped ashore, and followed on her steps to warn her of a peril in

front, alas! from me she fled as from another peril; and vainly I shouted

to her of quicksands that lay ahead. Faster and faster she ran; round a

promontory of rocks she wheeled out of sight; in an instant I also wheeled

round it, but only to see the treacherous sands gathering above her head.

Already her person was buried; only the fair young head and the diadem of

white roses around it were still visible to the pitying heavens; and, last

of all, was visible one marble arm. I saw by the early twilight this fair

young head, as it was sinking down to darkness&mdash;saw this marble arm, as it

rose above her head and her treacherous grave, tossing, faultering,

rising, clutching as at some false deceiving hand stretched out from the

clouds&mdash;saw this marble arm uttering her dying hope, and then her dying

despair. The head, the diadem, the arm,&mdash;these all had sunk; at last over

these also the cruel quicksand had closed; and no memorial of the fair

young girl remained on earth, except my own solitary tears, and the funeral

bells from the desert seas, that, rising again more softly, sang a requiem

over the grave of the buried child, and over her blighted dawn.</p>



<p id="id00296">I sate, and wept in secret the tears that men have ever given to the memory

of those that died before the dawn, and by the treachery of earth, our

mother. But the tears and funeral bells were hushed suddenly by a shout

as of many nations, and by a roar as from some great king's artillery

advancing rapidly along the valleys, and heard afar by its echoes among

the mountains. "Hush!" I said, as I bent my ear earthwards to

listen&mdash;"hush!&mdash;this either is the very anarchy of strife, or else"&mdash;and

then I listened more profoundly, and said as I raised my head&mdash;"or else, oh

heavens! it is <i>victory</i> that swallows up all strife."</p>



<p id="id00297" style="margin-top: 2em">4.</p>



<p id="id00298">Immediately, in trance, I was carried over land and sea to some distant

kingdom, and placed upon a triumphal car, amongst companions crowned with

laurel. The darkness of gathering midnight, brooding over all the land, hid

from us the mighty crowds that were weaving restlessly about our carriage

as a centre&mdash;we heard them, but we saw them not. Tidings had arrived,

within an hour, of a grandeur that measured itself against centuries; too

full of pathos they were, too full of joy that acknowledged no fountain

but God, to utter themselves by other language than by tears, by restles

anthems, by reverberations rising from every choir, of the <i>Gloria in

excelsis</i>. These tidings we that sate upon the laurelled car had it for our

privilege to publish amongst all nations. And already, by signs audible

through the darkness, by snortings and tramplings, our angry horses, that

knew no fear of fleshly weariness, upbraided us with delay. Wherefore <i>was</i>

it that we delayed? We waited for a secret word, that should bear witness

to the hope of nations, as now accomplished for ever. At midnight the

secret word arrived; which word was&mdash;Waterloo and Recovered Christendom!

The dreadful word shone by its own light; before us it went; high above our

leaders' heads it rode, and spread a golden light over the paths which we

traversed. Every city, at the presence of the secret word, threw open its

gates to receive us. The rivers were silent as we crossed. All the infinite

forests, as we ran along their margins, shivered in homage to the secret

word. And the darkness comprehended it.</p>



<p id="id00299">Two hours after midnight we reached a mighty minster. Its gates, which rose

to the clouds, were closed. But when the dreadful word, that rode before

us, reached them with its golden light, silently they moved back upon their

hinges; and at a flying gallop our equipage entered the grand aisle of the

cathedral. Headlong was our pace; and at every altar, in the little chapels

and oratories to the right hand and left of our course, the lamps, dying or

sickening, kindled anew in sympathy with the secret word that was flying

past. Forty leagues we might have run in the cathedral, and as yet no

strength of morning light had reached us, when we saw before us the aërial

galleries of the organ and the choir. Every pinnacle of the fretwork, every

station of advantage amongst the traceries, was crested by white-robed

choristers, that sang deliverance; that wept no more tears, as once their

fathers had wept; but at intervals that sang together to the generations,

saying&mdash;</p>



<p id="id00300">  "Chaunt the deliverer's praise in every tongue,"</p>



<p id="id00301">and receiving answers from afar,</p>



<p id="id00302">  &mdash;"such as once in heaven and earth were sung."</p>



<p id="id00303">And of their chaunting was no end; of our headlong pace was neither pause

nor remission.</p>



<p id="id00304">Thus, as we ran like torrents&mdash;thus, as we swept with bridal rapture over

the Campo Santo[1] of the cathedral graves&mdash;suddenly we became aware of

a vast necropolis rising upon the far-off horizon&mdash;a city of sepulchres,

built within the saintly cathedral for the warrior dead that rested from

their feuds on earth. Of purple granite was the necropolis; yet, in the

first minute, it lay like a purple stain upon the horizon&mdash;so mighty was

the distance. In the second minute it trembled through many changes,

growing into terraces and towers of wondrous altitude, so mighty was the

pace. In the third minute already, with our dreadful gallop, we were

entering its suburbs. Vast sarcophagi rose on every side, having towers and

turrets that, upon the limits of the central aisle, strode forward with

haughty intrusion, that ran back with mighty shadows into answering

recesses. Every sarcophagus showed many bas-reliefs&mdash;bas-reliefs of

battles&mdash;bas-reliefs of battle-fields; of battles from forgotten ages&mdash;of

battles from yesterday&mdash;of battle-fields that, long since, nature had

healed and reconciled to herself with the sweet oblivion of flowers&mdash;of

battle-fields that were yet angry and crimson with carnage. Where the

terraces ran, there did <i>we</i> run; where the towers curved, there did <i>we</i>

curve. With the flight of swallows our horses swept round every angle. Like

rivers in flood, wheeling round headlands; like hurricanes that side

into the secrets of forests; faster than ever light unwove the mazes of

darkness, our flying equipage carried earthly passions&mdash;kindled warrior

instincts&mdash;amongst the dust that lay around us; dust oftentimes of our

noble fathers that had slept in God from Créci to Trafalgar. And now had we

reached the last sarcophagus, now were we abreast of the last bas-relief,

already had we recovered the arrow-like flight of the illimitable central

aisle, when coming up this aisle to meet us we beheld a female infant that

rode in a carriage as frail as flowers. The mists, which went before her,

hid the fawns that drew her, but could not hide the shells and tropic

flowers with which she played&mdash;but could not hide the lovely smiles by

which she uttered her trust in the mighty cathedral, and in the cherubim

that looked down upon her from the topmast shafts of its pillars. Face to

face she was meeting us; face to face she rode, as if danger there were

none. "Oh, baby!" I exclaimed, "shalt thou be the ransom for Waterloo? Must

we, that carry tidings of great joy to every people, be messengers of ruin

to thee?" In horror I rose at the thought; but then also, in horror at the

thought, rose one that was sculptured on the bas-relief&mdash;a dying trumpeter.

Solemnly from the field of battle he rose to his feet; and, unslinging

his stony trumpet, carried it, in his dying anguish, to his stony

lips&mdash;sounding once, and yet once again; proclamation that, in <i>thy</i> ears,

oh baby! must have spoken from the battlements of death. Immediately deep

shadows fell between us, and aboriginal silence. The choir had ceased to

sing. The hoofs of our horses, the rattling of our harness, alarmed the

graves no more. By horror the bas-relief had been unlocked into life. By

horror we, that were so full of life, we men and our horses, with their

fiery fore-legs rising in mid air to their everlasting gallop, were frozen

to a bas-relief. Then a third time the trumpet sounded; the seals were

taken off all pulses; life, and the frenzy of life, tore into their

channels again; again the choir burst forth in sunny grandeur, as from

the muffling of storms and darkness; again the thunderings of our horses

carried temptation into the graves. One cry burst from our lips as the

clouds, drawing off from the aisle, showed it empty before us&mdash;"Whither has

the infant fled?&mdash;is the young child caught up to God?" Lo! afar off, in a

vast recess, rose three mighty windows to the clouds: and on a level with

their summits, at height insuperable to man, rose an altar of purest

alabaster. On its eastern face was trembling a crimson glory. Whence came

<i>that</i>? Was it from the reddening dawn that now streamed <i>through</i> the

windows? Was it from the crimson robes of the martyrs that were painted

<i>on</i> the windows? Was it from the bloody bas-reliefs of earth? Whencesoever

it were&mdash;there, within that crimson radiance, suddenly appeared a female

head, and then a female figure. It was the child&mdash;now grown up to woman's

height. Clinging to the horns of the altar, there she stood&mdash;sinking,

rising, trembling, fainting&mdash;raving, despairing; and behind the volume of

incense that, night and day, streamed upwards from the altar, was seen the

fiery font, and dimly was descried the outline of the dreadful being that

should baptize her with the baptism of death. But by her side was kneeling

her better angel, that hid his face with wings; that wept and pleaded for

<i>her</i>; that prayed when <i>she</i> could <i>not</i>; that fought with heaven by tears

for <i>her</i> deliverance; which also, as he raised his immortal countenance

from his wings, I saw, by the glory in his eye, that he had won at last.</p>



<p id="id00305">[Footnote 1: <i>Campo Santo</i>.&mdash;It is probable that most of my readers will be

acquainted with the history of the Campo Santo at Pisa&mdash;composed of earth

brought from Jerusalem for a bed of sanctity, as the highest prize which

the noble piety of crusaders could ask or imagine. There is another Campo

Santo at Naples, formed, however, (I presume,) on the example given by

Pisa. Possibly the idea may have been more extensively copied. To readers

who are unacquainted with England, or who (being English) are yet

unacquainted with the cathedral cities of England, it may be right to

mention that the graves within-side the cathedrals often form a flat

pavement over which carriages and horses might roll; and perhaps a boyish

remembrance of one particular cathedral, across which I had seen passengers

walk and burdens carried, may have assisted my dream.]</p>



<p id="id00306" style="margin-top: 2em">5.</p>



<p id="id00307">Then rose the agitation, spreading through the infinite cathedral, to its

agony; then was completed the passion of the mighty fugue. The golden

tubes of the organ, which as yet had but sobbed and muttered at

intervals&mdash;gleaming amongst clouds and surges of incense&mdash;threw up, as

from fountains unfathomable, columns of heart-shattering music. Choir

and anti-choir were filling fast with unknown voices. Thou also, Dying

Trumpeter!&mdash;with thy love that was victorious, and thy anguish that was

finishing, didst enter the tumult: trumpet and echo&mdash;farewell love, and

farewell anguish&mdash;rang through the dreadful <i>sanctus</i>. We, that spread

flight before us, heard the tumult, as of flight, mustering behind us. In

fear we looked round for the unknown steps that, in flight or in pursuit,

were gathering upon our own. Who were these that followed? The faces, which

no man could count&mdash;whence were <i>they</i>? "Oh, darkness of the grave!" I

exclaimed, "that from the crimson altar and from the fiery font wert

visited with secret light&mdash;that wert searched by the effulgence in the

angel's eye&mdash;were these indeed thy children? Pomps of life, that, from the

burials of centuries, rose again to the voice of perfect joy, could it be

<i>ye</i> that had wrapped me in the reflux of panic?" What ailed me, that I

should fear when the triumphs of earth were advancing? Ah! Pariah heart

within me, that couldst never hear the sound of joy without sullen whispers

of treachery in ambush; that, from six years old, didst never hear the

promise of perfect love, without seeing aloft amongst the stars fingers

as of a man's hand, writing the secret legend&mdash;"<i>Ashes to ashes, dust to

dust</i>!"&mdash;wherefore shouldst <i>thou</i> not fear, though all men should rejoice?

Lo! as I looked back for seventy leagues through the mighty cathedral, and

saw the quick and the dead that sang together to God, together that sang

to the generations of man&mdash;ah! raving, as of torrents that opened on every

side: trepidation, as of female and infant steps that fled&mdash;ah! rushing,

as of wings that chase! But I heard a voice from heaven, which said&mdash;"Let

there be no reflux of panic&mdash;let there be no more fear, and no more sudden

death! Cover them with joy as the tides cover the shore!" <i>That</i> heard the

children of the choir, <i>that</i> heard the children of the grave. All the

hosts of jubilation made ready to move. Like armies that ride in pursuit,

they moved with one step. Us, that, with laurelled heads, were passing from

the cathedral through its eastern gates, they overtook, and, as with a

garment, they wrapped us round with thunders that overpowered our own.

As brothers we moved together; to the skies we rose&mdash;to the dawn that

advanced&mdash;to the stars that fled; rendering thanks to God in the

highest&mdash;that, having hid his face through one generation behind thick

clouds of War, once again was ascending&mdash;was ascending from Waterloo&mdash;in

the visions of Peace; rendering thanks for thee, young girl! whom having

overshadowed with his ineffable passion of death&mdash;suddenly did God relent;

suffered thy angel to turn aside his arm; and even in thee, sister unknown!

shown to me for a moment only to be hidden for ever, found an occasion to

glorify his goodness. A thousand times, amongst the phantoms of sleep, has

he shown thee to me, standing before the golden dawn, and ready to enter

its gates&mdash;with the dreadful word going before thee&mdash;with the armies of the

grave behind thee; shown thee to me, sinking, rising, fluttering, fainting,

but then suddenly reconciled, adoring: a thousand times has he followed

thee in the worlds of sleep&mdash;through storms; through desert seas; through

the darkness of quicksands; through fugues and the persecution of fugues;

through dreams, and the dreadful resurrections that are in dreams&mdash;only

that at the last, with one motion of his victorious arm, he might record

and emblazon the endless resurrections of his love!</p>
