<h2>

    CHAPTER II

</h2>

<p>

No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,

the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank

Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls before

dinner, and every thing was safe.

</p>

<p>

No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room

at the Crown was to witness it;&mdash;but it would be better than a

common meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his

entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,

for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of

the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him,

and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company.

She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the

Randalls party just sufficiently before them.

</p>

<p>

Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not

say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.

They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should

be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another

carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great

surprize. "So unreasonably early!" she was going to exclaim; but she

presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming,

like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and

they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins,

who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing

earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company

might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory

inspection.

</p>

<p>

Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston

depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man

who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first

distinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but

a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher

character.&mdash;General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a

man what he ought to be.&mdash;She could fancy such a man. The whole party

walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing

else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe

in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though

<i>May</i>, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.

</p>

<p>

Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy

councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door

to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be

brought by the Eltons.

</p>

<p>

Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,

which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to

the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,&mdash;impatient

to begin, or afraid of being always near her.

</p>

<p>

Mrs. Elton was spoken of. "I think she must be here soon," said he. "I

have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.

It cannot be long, I think, before she comes."

</p>

<p>

A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,

said,

</p>

<p>

"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen

either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward."

</p>

<p>

Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties

passed.

</p>

<p>

"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking about. "We

thought you were to bring them."

</p>

<p>

The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma

longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how

he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of

graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,

by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.

</p>

<p>

In a few minutes the carriage returned.&mdash;Somebody talked of rain.&mdash;"I

will see that there are umbrellas, sir," said Frank to his father:

"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:" and away he went. Mr. Weston was

following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion

of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,

though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.

</p>

<p>

"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you

I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely

pleased with him.&mdash;You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him

a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and

approve&mdash;so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.

You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies&mdash;quite a horror of them.

They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor

me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very

cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them

much better."

</p>

<p>

While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but

when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies

just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.

</p>

<p>

Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. "I have no doubt of its being our

carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so

extremely expeditious!&mdash;I believe we drive faster than any body.&mdash;What

a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!&mdash;I understand you

were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.

You may be very sure I shall always take care of <i>them</i>."

</p>

<p>

Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into

the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.

Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understood

by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body's words,

were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in

talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her

being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened she was

heard,

</p>

<p>

"So very obliging of you!&mdash;No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not

care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares&mdash;Well!&mdash;(as soon

as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!&mdash;This is

admirable!&mdash;Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could

not have imagined it.&mdash;So well lighted up!&mdash;Jane, Jane, look!&mdash;did you

ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's

lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as

I came in; she was standing in the entrance. 'Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said

I&mdash;but I had not time for more." She was now met by Mrs. Weston.&mdash;"Very

well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear

it. So afraid you might have a headache!&mdash;seeing you pass by so often,

and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed.

Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!&mdash;excellent

time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most

comfortable carriage.&mdash;Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you,

Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note,

or we should have been.&mdash;But two such offers in one day!&mdash;Never were

such neighbours. I said to my mother, 'Upon my word, ma'am&mdash;.' Thank

you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her

take her shawl&mdash;for the evenings are not warm&mdash;her large new shawl&mdash;

Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.&mdash;So kind of her to think of my mother!

Bought at Weymouth, you know&mdash;Mr. Dixon's choice. There were three

others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel

Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did

not wet your feet?&mdash;It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:&mdash;but

Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely&mdash;and there was a mat to step

upon&mdash;I shall never forget his extreme politeness.&mdash;Oh! Mr. Frank

Churchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in

fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of

your good-nature. Does not she, Jane?&mdash;Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank

Churchill?&mdash;Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.&mdash;Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do

you do?&mdash;Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite

in fairy-land!&mdash;Such a transformation!&mdash;Must not compliment, I know

(eyeing Emma most complacently)&mdash;that would be rude&mdash;but upon my word,

Miss Woodhouse, you do look&mdash;how do you like Jane's hair?&mdash;You are

a judge.&mdash;She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her

hair!&mdash;No hairdresser from London I think could.&mdash;Ah! Dr. Hughes I

declare&mdash;and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a

moment.&mdash;How do you do? How do you do?&mdash;Very well, I thank you. This

is delightful, is not it?&mdash;Where's dear Mr. Richard?&mdash;Oh! there he is.

Don't disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How

do you do, Mr. Richard?&mdash;I saw you the other day as you rode through

the town&mdash;Mrs. Otway, I protest!&mdash;and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway

and Miss Caroline.&mdash;Such a host of friends!&mdash;and Mr. George and Mr.

Arthur!&mdash;How do you do? How do you all do?&mdash;Quite well, I am much

obliged to you. Never better.&mdash;Don't I hear another carriage?&mdash;Who can

this be?&mdash;very likely the worthy Coles.&mdash;Upon my word, this is charming

to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!&mdash;I am

quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me&mdash;never take coffee.&mdash;A

little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,&mdash;no hurry&mdash;Oh! here it comes.

Every thing so good!"

</p>

<p>

Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss

Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse

of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind

her.&mdash;He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could not

determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look,

compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently

wanting to be complimented herself&mdash;and it was, "How do you like

my gown?&mdash;How do you like my trimming?&mdash;How has Wright done my

hair?"&mdash;with many other relative questions, all answered with patient

politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, "Nobody can think less of dress in

general than I do&mdash;but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's

eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons&mdash;who I have

no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour&mdash;I would not wish

to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except

mine.&mdash;So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.&mdash;We shall

see if our styles suit.&mdash;A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.

I like him very well."

</p>

<p>

At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not

but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear

more;&mdash;and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till

another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly

forward.&mdash;Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,

</p>

<p>

"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?&mdash;I was

this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for

tidings of us."

</p>

<p>

"Jane!"&mdash;repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and

displeasure.&mdash;"That is easy&mdash;but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I

suppose."

</p>

<p>

"How do you like Mrs. Elton?" said Emma in a whisper.

</p>

<p>

"Not at all."

</p>

<p>

"You are ungrateful."

</p>

<p>

"Ungrateful!&mdash;What do you mean?" Then changing from a frown to a

smile&mdash;"No, do not tell me&mdash;I do not want to know what you mean.&mdash;Where

is my father?&mdash;When are we to begin dancing?"

</p>

<p>

Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked

off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and

Mrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be

laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton

must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which

interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.&mdash;Emma

heard the sad truth with fortitude.

</p>

<p>

"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?" said Mr. Weston.

"She will think Frank ought to ask her."

</p>

<p>

Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and

boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect

approbation of&mdash;and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting <i>him</i>

to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to

persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.&mdash;Mr. Weston and Mrs.

Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.

Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always

considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make

her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this

time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to

begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston

might be his son's superior.&mdash;In spite of this little rub, however,

Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length

of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours

of unusual festivity before her.&mdash;She was more disturbed by Mr.

Knightley's not dancing than by any thing else.&mdash;There he was, among

the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,&mdash;not

classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who

were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were

made up,&mdash;so young as he looked!&mdash;He could not have appeared to greater

advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall,

firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of

the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes;

and, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of

young men who could be compared with him.&mdash;He moved a few steps nearer,

and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner,

with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the

trouble.&mdash;Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but

in general he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroom

better, and could like Frank Churchill better.&mdash;He seemed often

observing her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of her

dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel

afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.

They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank

Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.

</p>

<p>

The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant

attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed

happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom

bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in

the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very

recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually

are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.&mdash;The two

last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;&mdash;the

only young lady sitting down;&mdash;and so equal had been hitherto the

number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the

wonder!&mdash;But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton

sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible

to be avoided: she was sure he would not&mdash;and she was expecting him

every moment to escape into the card-room.

</p>

<p>

Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room where

the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front

of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining

it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or

speaking to those who were close to her.&mdash;Emma saw it. She was not yet

dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore

leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw

it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly

behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr.

Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which

just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that

his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only

listening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.&mdash;The

kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say,

"Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?" to which his prompt reply was, "Most

readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."

</p>

<p>

"Me!&mdash;oh! no&mdash;I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no

dancer."

</p>

<p>

"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance," said he, "I shall have great

pleasure, I am sure&mdash;for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old

married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very

great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.

Gilbert."

</p>

<p>

"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady

disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing&mdash;Miss Smith." "Miss

Smith!&mdash;oh!&mdash;I had not observed.&mdash;You are extremely obliging&mdash;and if I

were not an old married man.&mdash;But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.

You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your

command&mdash;but my dancing days are over."

</p>

<p>

Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and

mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton! the

amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.&mdash;She looked round for a moment; he

had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself

for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him

and his wife.

</p>

<p>

She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her

face might be as hot.

</p>

<p>

In another moment a happier sight caught her;&mdash;Mr. Knightley leading

Harriet to the set!&mdash;Never had she been more surprized, seldom more

delighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,

both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though

too distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could

catch his eye again.

</p>

<p>

His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;

and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for

the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment

and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features

announced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,

flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.

</p>

<p>

Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very

foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though

growing very like her;&mdash;<i>she</i> spoke some of her feelings, by observing

audibly to her partner,

</p>

<p>

"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!&mdash;Very good-natured,

I declare."

</p>

<p>

Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from

that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and

taking up her spoon.

</p>

<p>

"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?&mdash;Here is your tippet. Mrs.

Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there will

be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done&mdash;One door

nailed up&mdash;Quantities of matting&mdash;My dear Jane, indeed you must.

Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!&mdash;so

gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!&mdash;Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I

said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and

nobody missed me.&mdash;I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.

Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a

vast deal of chat, and backgammon.&mdash;Tea was made downstairs, biscuits

and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some

of her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were

amused, and who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall

Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell

you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,

I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear

sir, you are too obliging.&mdash;Is there nobody you would not rather?&mdash;I am

not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and

me on the other!&mdash;Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is

going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!&mdash;Beautiful lace!&mdash;Now we

all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!&mdash;Well, here we

are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no,

there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd!

I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any

thing equal to the comfort and style&mdash;Candles everywhere.&mdash;I was telling

you of your grandmama, Jane,&mdash;There was a little disappointment.&mdash;The

baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there

was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at

first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled

enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves

better than sweetbread and asparagus&mdash;so she was rather disappointed,

but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of

its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much

concerned!&mdash;Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have

supposed any thing!&mdash;Such elegance and profusion!&mdash;I have seen nothing

like it since&mdash;Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere,

so that Jane is not in a draught. Where <i>I</i> sit is of no consequence.

Oh! do you recommend this side?&mdash;Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill&mdash;only

it seems too good&mdash;but just as you please. What you direct in this house

cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes

for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but

it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning."

</p>

<p>

Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;

but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited

him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his

reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;

and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.

</p>

<p>

"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet," said he. "Emma, why is it

that they are your enemies?"

</p>

<p>

He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,

"<i>She</i> ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may

be.&mdash;To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,

that you did want him to marry Harriet."

</p>

<p>

"I did," replied Emma, "and they cannot forgive me."

</p>

<p>

He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he

only said,

</p>

<p>

"I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections."

</p>

<p>

"Can you trust me with such flatterers?&mdash;Does my vain spirit ever tell

me I am wrong?"

</p>

<p>

"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.&mdash;If one leads you wrong,

I am sure the other tells you of it."

</p>

<p>

"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is

a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and I

was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was through a

series of strange blunders!"

</p>

<p>

"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the

justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has

chosen for himself.&mdash;Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which

Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless

girl&mdash;infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a

woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected."

Emma was extremely gratified.&mdash;They were interrupted by the bustle of

Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.

</p>

<p>

"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all

doing?&mdash;Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!

Every body is asleep!"

</p>

<p>

"I am ready," said Emma, "whenever I am wanted."

</p>

<p>

"Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley.

</p>

<p>

She hesitated a moment, and then replied, "With you, if you will ask

me."

</p>

<p>

"Will you?" said he, offering his hand.

</p>

<p>

"Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are

not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper."

</p>

<p>

"Brother and sister! no, indeed."
