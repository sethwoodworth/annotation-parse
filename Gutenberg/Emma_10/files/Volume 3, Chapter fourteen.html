<h2>

    CHAPTER XIV

</h2>

<p>

What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from

what she had brought out!&mdash;she had then been only daring to hope for

a little respite of suffering;&mdash;she was now in an exquisite flutter of

happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be

greater when the flutter should have passed away.

</p>

<p>

They sat down to tea&mdash;the same party round the same table&mdash;how often

it had been collected!&mdash;and how often had her eyes fallen on the same

shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the

western sun!&mdash;But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing

like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her

usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive

daughter.

</p>

<p>

Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the

breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously

hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.&mdash;Could he have seen the

heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the

most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest

perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either,

he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had

received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment,

totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.

</p>

<p>

As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;

but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and

subdued&mdash;and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax

for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points

to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some

alloy. Her father&mdash;and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling

the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort

of both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father,

it was a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley

would ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most

solemn resolution of never quitting her father.&mdash;She even wept over

the idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an

engagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of

drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.&mdash;How

to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;&mdash;how to spare

her from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;

how to appear least her enemy?&mdash;On these subjects, her perplexity

and distress were very great&mdash;and her mind had to pass again and

again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever

surrounded it.&mdash;She could only resolve at last, that she would still

avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by

letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed

just now for a time from Highbury, and&mdash;indulging in one scheme

more&mdash;nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation

for her to Brunswick Square.&mdash;Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;

and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.&mdash;She did

not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty

and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.&mdash;At any rate,

it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom

every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the

evil day, when they must all be together again.

</p>

<p>

She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which

left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking

up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half

an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,

literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a

proper share of the happiness of the evening before.

</p>

<p>

He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the

slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was

brought her from Randalls&mdash;a very thick letter;&mdash;she guessed what it

must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.&mdash;She was now

in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she

wanted only to have her thoughts to herself&mdash;and as for understanding

any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.&mdash;It must be

waded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;&mdash;a

note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to

Mrs. Weston.

</p>

<p>

"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the

enclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely

a doubt of its happy effect.&mdash;I think we shall never materially disagree

about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.&mdash;We

are quite well.&mdash;This letter has been the cure of all the little

nervousness I have been feeling lately.&mdash;I did not quite like your looks

on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never

own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east

wind.&mdash;I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday

afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing last

night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.

</p>

                              "Yours ever,

                                                       "A. W."



                       [To Mrs. Weston.]

<pre>

                                                       WINDSOR-JULY.

MY DEAR MADAM,

</pre>

<p>

"If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be

expected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and

indulgence.&mdash;You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of

even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.&mdash;But

I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage

rises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be

humble. I have already met with such success in two applications for

pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,

and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.&mdash;You

must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I

first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret which

was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to place

myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.

I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to <i>think</i> it a right,

I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and

casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my

difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to

require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we

parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the

creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.&mdash;Had she refused, I

should have gone mad.&mdash;But you will be ready to say, what was your

hope in doing this?&mdash;What did you look forward to?&mdash;To any thing, every

thing&mdash;to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,

perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of

good was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining her

promises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther explanation,

I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband's son, and

the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which no

inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.&mdash;See

me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit to

Randalls;&mdash;and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have

been sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come till

Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as <i>you</i> were the person slighted, you

will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion, by

reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house, so long

I lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour, during the very

happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to

reprehension, excepting on one point. And now I come to the principal,

the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, which

excites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation. With

the greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss

Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest

humiliation.&mdash;A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his

opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.&mdash;My behaviour

to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.&mdash;In order to

assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than

an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately

thrown.&mdash;I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object&mdash;but

I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been

convinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any

selfish views to go on.&mdash;Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is,

she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and

that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me,

was as much my conviction as my wish.&mdash;She received my attentions with

an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.

We seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, those

attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.&mdash;Whether Miss Woodhouse

began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight,

I cannot say;&mdash;when I called to take leave of her, I remember that I was

within a moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not

without suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me,

at least in some degree.&mdash;She may not have surmised the whole, but her

quickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find,

whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it

did not take her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it.

I remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude

for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.&mdash;I hope this history of my conduct

towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation

of what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against

Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and

procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes

of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly

affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as

myself.&mdash;Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,

you have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to

get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.

If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.&mdash;Of

the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that

its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F&mdash;, who would never

have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.&mdash;The

delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam,

is much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly

hope, know her thoroughly yourself.&mdash;No description can describe her.

She must tell you herself what she is&mdash;yet not by word, for never

was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own

merit.&mdash;Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw,

I have heard from her.&mdash;She gives a good account of her own health; but

as she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion

of her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread

of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without

delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few

minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and

I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or

misery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her

excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:

but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little

I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her

again!&mdash;But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me

to encroach.&mdash;I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard

all that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail

yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness

with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event

of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the

happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures,

but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to

lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she

would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and

refinement.&mdash;But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had entered

into with that woman&mdash;Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off

abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.&mdash;I have been walking over

the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of

my letter what it ought to be.&mdash;It is, in fact, a most mortifying

retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that

my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly

blameable. <i>She</i> disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.&mdash;My

plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.&mdash;She was

displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand

occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even

cold. But she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and

subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have

escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.&mdash;We quarrelled.&mdash;

Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?&mdash;<i>There</i> every little

dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late;

I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she

would not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then

thought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very

natural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the

world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable

particularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a

proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?&mdash;Had we

been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must

have been suspected.&mdash;I was mad enough, however, to resent.&mdash;I doubted

her affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when,

provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect

of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been

impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in

a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.&mdash;In short, my dear

madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and

I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with

you till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with

her as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to

be reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her

coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the first

advances.&mdash;I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of

the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly

suppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon

her appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she

found I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that

officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the

bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel

with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards

myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it

which that woman has known.&mdash;'Jane,' indeed!&mdash;You will observe that I

have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you.

Think, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between

the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the

insolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon

have done.&mdash;She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me

entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet

again.&mdash;<i>She</i> <i>felt</i> <i>the</i> <i>engagement</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>a</i> <i>source</i> <i>of</i>

<i>repentance</i> <i>and</i> <i>misery</i> <i>to</i> <i>each</i>: <i>she</i> <i>dissolved</i> <i>it</i>.&mdash;This

letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. I

answered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the

multiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of

being sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in

my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but

a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.&mdash;I was

rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I

made excuses for her, and was too busy, and&mdash;may I add?&mdash;too cheerful

in my views to be captious.&mdash;We removed to Windsor; and two

days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all

returned!&mdash;and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her

extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and

adding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued,

and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate

arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe

conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly

command hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would

forward them after that period to her at&mdash;: in short, the full direction

to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew the

name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had

been doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character

which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as to

any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of its

anxious delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to threaten

me.&mdash;Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my

own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.&mdash;What was to be

done?&mdash;One thing only.&mdash;I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction I

could not hope to be listened to again.&mdash;I spoke; circumstances were

in my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was,

earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying;

and could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished I

might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.&mdash;I

felt that it would be of a different sort.&mdash;Are you disposed to pity

me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my

suspense while all was at stake?&mdash;No; do not pity me till I reached

Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her. Do not pity me till I saw her

wan, sick looks.&mdash;I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my

knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance

of finding her alone.&mdash;I was not disappointed; and at last I was not

disappointed either in the object of my journey. A great deal of very

reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away. But it is

done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment's

uneasiness can ever occur between us again. Now, my dear madam, I will

release you; but I could not conclude before. A thousand and a thousand

thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for

the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.&mdash;If you think me in

a way to be happier than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.&mdash;Miss

W. calls me the child of good fortune. I hope she is right.&mdash;In one

respect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe

myself,
