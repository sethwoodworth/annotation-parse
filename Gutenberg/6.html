<h2 id="id00308" style="margin-top: 3em">DINNER, REAL AND REPUTED.</h2>



<p id="id00309" style="margin-top: 2em">Great misconceptions have always prevailed about the Roman <i>dinner</i>.

Dinner [<i>coena</i>] was the only meal which the Romans as a nation took. It

was no accident, but arose out of their whole social economy. This we shall

show by running through the history of a Roman day. <i>Ridentem dicere, verum

quid vetat</i>? And the course of this review will expose one or two important

truths in ancient political economy, which have been wholly overlooked.</p>



<p id="id00310">With the lark it was that the Roman rose. Not that the earliest lark rises

so early in Latium as the earliest lark in England; that is, during summer:

but then, on the other hand, neither does it ever rise so late. The Roman

citizen was stirring with the dawn&mdash;which, allowing for the shorter

longest-day and longer shortest-day of Rome, you may call about four in

summer&mdash;about seven in winter. Why did he do this? Because he went to bed

at a very early hour. But why did he do that? By backing in this way, we

shall surely back into the very well of truth: always, if it is possible,

let us have the <i>pourquoi</i> of the <i>pourquoi</i>. The Roman went to bed early

for two special reasons. 1st, Because in Rome, which had been built for a

martial destiny, every habit of life had reference to the usages of war.

Every citizen, if he were not a mere proletarian animal kept at the public

cost, held himself a sort of soldier-elect: the more noble he was, the

more was his liability to military service: in short, all Rome, and at all

times, was consciously "in procinct."[1] Now it was a principle of ancient

warfare, that every hour of daylight had a triple worth, if valued

against hours of darkness. That was one reason&mdash;a reason suggested by the

understanding. But there was a second reason, far more remarkable; and this

was a reason dictated by a blind necessity. It is an important fact, that

this planet on which we live, this little industrious earth of ours, has

developed her wealth by slow stages of increase. She was far from being the

rich little globe in Cæsar's days that she is at present. The earth in our

days is incalculably richer, as a whole, than in the time of Charlemagne:

at that time she was richer, by many a million of acres, than in the era

of Augustus. In that Augustan era we descry a clear belt of cultivation,

averaging about six hundred miles in depth, running in a ring-fence about

the Mediterranean. This belt, <i>and no more</i>, was in decent cultivation.

Beyond that belt, there was only a wild Indian cultivation. At present

what a difference! We have that very belt, but much richer, all things

considered <i>æquatis æquandis</i>, than in the Roman era. The reader must not

look to single cases, as that of Egypt or other parts of Africa, but take

the whole collectively. On that scheme of valuation, we have the old Roman

belt, the Mediterranean riband not much tarnished, and we have all the

rest of Europe to boot&mdash;or, speaking in scholar's language, as a <i>lucro

ponamus</i>. We say nothing of remoter gains. Such being the case, our mother,

the earth, being (as a whole) so incomparably poorer, could not in the

Pagan era support the expense of maintaining great empires in cold

latitudes. Her purse would not reach that cost. Wherever she undertook in

those early ages to rear man in great abundance, it must be where nature

would consent to work in partnership with herself; where <i>warmth</i> was to

be had for nothing; where <i>clothes</i> were not so entirely indispensable but

that a ragged fellow might still keep himself warm; where slight <i>shelter</i>

might serve; and where the <i>soil</i>, if not absolutely richer in reversionary

wealth, was more easily cultured. Nature must come forward liberally, and

take a number of shares in every new joint-stock concern before it could

move. Man, therefore, went to bed early in those ages, simply because his

worthy mother earth could not afford him candles. She, good old lady, (or

good young lady, for geologists know not[2] whether she is in that stage

of her progress which corresponds to gray hairs, or to infancy, or to "a

<i>certain</i> age,")&mdash;she, good lady, would certainly have shuddered to hear

any of her nations asking for candles. "Candles!" She would have said, "Who

ever heard of such a thing? and with so much excellent daylight running to

waste, as I have provided <i>gratis</i>! What will the wretches want next?"</p>



<p id="id00311">The daylight, furnished <i>gratis</i>, was certainly "neat," and "undeniable"

in its quality, and quite sufficient for all purposes that were honest.

Seneca, even in his own luxurious period, called those men "<i>lucifugæ</i>,"

and by other ugly names, who lived chiefly by candle-light. None but rich

and luxurious men, nay, even amongst these, none but idlers <i>did</i> live much

by candle-light. An immense majority of men in Rome never lighted a candle,

unless sometimes in the early dawn. And this custom of Rome was the custom

also of all nations that lived round the great pond of the Mediterranean.

In Athens, Egypt, Palestine, Asia Minor, everywhere, the ancients went to

bed, like good boys, from seven to nine o'clock.[3] The Turks and other

people, who have succeeded to the stations and the habits of the ancients,

do so at this day.</p>



<p id="id00312">The Roman, therefore, who saw no joke in sitting round a table in the dark,

went off to bed as the darkness began. Everybody did so. Old Numa Pompilius

himself, was obliged to trundle off in the dusk. Tarquinius might be a very

superb fellow; but we doubt whether he ever saw a farthing rushlight. And,

though it may be thought that plots and conspiracies would flourish in

such a city of darkness, it is to be considered, that the conspirators

themselves had no more candles than honest men: both parties were in the

dark.</p>



<p id="id00313">Being up then, and stirring not long after the lark, what mischief did the

Roman go about first? Now-a-days, he would have taken a pipe or a cigar.

But, alas for the ignorance of the poor heathen creatures! they had neither

one nor the other. In this point, we must tax our mother earth with

being really <i>too</i> stingy. In the case of the candles, we approve of her

parsimony. Much mischief is brewed by candle-light. But, it was coming it

too strong to allow no tobacco. Many a wild fellow in Rome, your Gracchi,

Syllas, Catilines, would not have played "h&mdash;&mdash; and Tommy" in the way they

did, if they could have soothed their angry stomachs with a cigar&mdash;a pipe

has intercepted many an evil scheme. But the thing is past helping now. At

Rome, you must do as "they does" at Rome. So, after shaving, (supposing the

age of the <i>Barbati</i> to be passed), what is the first business that our

Roman will undertake? Forty to one he is a poor man, born to look upwards

to his fellow-men&mdash;and not to look down upon anybody but slaves. He goes,

therefore, to the palace of some grandee, some top-sawyer of the Senatorian

order. This great man, for all his greatness, has turned out even sooner

than himself. For he also has had no candles and no cigars; and he well

knows, that before the sun looks into his portals, all his halls will be

overflowing and buzzing with the matin susurrus of courtiers&mdash;the "mane

salutantes."[4] it is as much as his popularity is worth to absent himself,

or to keep people waiting. But surely, the reader may think, this poor man

he might keep waiting. No, he might not; for, though poor, being a citizen,

he is a gentleman. That was the consequence of keeping slaves. Wherever

there is a class of slaves, he that enjoys the <i>jus suffragii</i> (no

matter how poor) is a gentleman. The true Latin word for a gentleman is

<i>ingentius</i>&mdash;a freeman and the son of a freeman.</p>



<p id="id00314">Yet even here there <i>were</i> distinctions. Under the Emperors, the courtiers

were divided into two classes: with respect to the superior class, it was

said of the sovereign&mdash;that he <i>saw</i> them, (<i>videbat</i>;) with respect to the

other&mdash;that he <i>was seen</i>, ("<i>videbatur</i>.") Even Plutarch mentions it as

a common boast in his times, [Greek: aemas eiden ho basileus]&mdash;<i>Cæsar is

in the habit of seeing me</i>; or, as a common plea for evading a suit,

[Greek: ora mallon]&mdash;<i>I am sorry to say he is more inclined to look upon

others</i>. And this usage derived itself (mark that well!) from the

<i>republican</i> era. The aulic spirit was propagated by the Empire, but from

a republican root.</p>



<p id="id00315">Having paid his court, you will suppose that our friend comes home to

breakfast. Not at all: no such discovery as "breakfast" had then been made:

breakfast was not invented for many centuries after that. We have always

admired, and always shall admire, as the very best of all human stories,

Charles Lamb's account of the origin of <i>roast pig</i> in China. Ching Ping,

it seems, had suffered his father's house to be burned down; the outhouses

were burned along with the house; and in one of these the pigs, by

accident, were roasted to a turn. Memorable were the results for all future

China and future civilization. Ping, who (like all China beside) had

hitherto eaten his pig raw, now for the first time tasted it in a state

of torrefaction. Of course he made his peace with his father by a part

(tradition says a leg) of the new dish. The father was so astounded with

the discovery, that he burned his house down once a year for the sake of

coming at an annual banquet of roast pig. A curious prying sort of fellow,

one Chang Pang, got to know of this. He also burned down a house with a

pig in it, and had his eyes opened. The secret was ill kept&mdash;the discovery

spread&mdash;many great conversions were made&mdash;houses were blazing in every part

of the Celestial Empire. The insurance offices took the matter up.

One Chong Pong, detected in the very act of shutting up a pig in his

drawing-room, and then firing a train, was indicted on a charge of arson.

The chief justice of Pekin, on that occasion, requested an officer of the

court to hand him a piece of the roast pig, the <i>corpus delicti</i>, for pure

curiosity led him to taste; but within two days after it was observed that

his lordship's town-house was burned down. In short, all China apostatized

to the new faith; and it was not until some centuries had passed, that a

great genius arose, who established the second era in the history of roast

pig, by showing that it could be had without burning down a house.</p>



<p id="id00316">No such genius had yet arisen in Rome. Breakfast was not suspected. No

prophecy, no type of breakfast had been published. In fact, it took as much

time and research to arrive at that great discovery as at the Copernican

system. True it is, reader, that you have heard of such a word as

<i>jentaculum</i>; and your dictionary translates that old heathen word by

the Christian word <i>breakfast</i>. But dictionaries, one and all, are dull

deceivers. Between <i>jentaculum</i> and <i>breakfast</i> the differences are as wide

as between a horse-chestnut and chestnut horse; differences in the <i>time

when</i>, in the <i>place where</i>, in the <i>manner how</i>, but preeminently in the

<i>thing which</i>.</p>



<p id="id00317">Galen is a good authority upon such a subject, since, if (like other

pagans) he ate no breakfast himself, in some sense he may be called the

cause of breakfast to other men, by treating of those things which could

safely be taken upon an empty stomach. As to the time, he (like many other

authors) says, [peri tritaen, ae (to makroteron) peri tetartaen,]

about the third, or at farthest about the fourth hour: and so exact is he,

that he assumes the day to lie exactly between six and six o'clock, and to

be divided into thirteen equal portions. So the time will be a few minutes

before nine, or a few minutes before ten, in the forenoon. That seems fair

enough. But it is not time in respect to its location that we are so

much concerned with, as time in respect to its duration. Now, heaps of

authorities take it for granted, that you are not to sit down&mdash;you are to

stand; and, as to the place, that any place will do&mdash;"any corner of the

forum," says Galen, "any corner that you fancy;" which is like referring a

man for his <i>salle à manger</i> to Westminster Hall or Fleet Street. Augustus,

in a letter still surviving, tells us that he <i>jentabat</i>, or took his

<i>jentaculum</i> in his carriage; now in a wheel carriage, (<i>in essedo</i>,) now

in a litter or palanquin (<i>in lecticâ</i>.) This careless and disorderly

way as to time and place, and other circumstances of haste, sufficiently

indicate the quality of the meal you are to expect. Already you are

"sagacious of your quarry from so far." Not that we would presume,

excellent reader, to liken you to Death, or to insinuate that you are

"a grim feature." But would it not make a saint "grim," to hear of such

preparations for the morning meal? And then to hear of such consummations

as <i>panis siccus</i>, dry bread; or, (if the learned reader thinks it will

taste better in Greek,) [Greek: artos xaeros!] And what may this word

<i>dry</i> happen to mean? "Does it mean stale bread?" says Salmasius. "Shall

we suppose," says he, in querulous words, "<i>molli et recenti opponi</i>," and

from that antithesis conclude it to be, "<i>durum et non recens coctum, eoque

sicciorem</i>?" Hard and stale, and for that reason the more arid! Not quite

so bad as that, we hope. Or again&mdash;"<i>siccum pro biscocto, ut hodie vocamus,

sumemus</i>?"[5] By <i>hodie</i> Salmasius means, amongst his countrymen of France,

where <i>biscoctus</i> is verbatim reproduced in the word <i>bis</i> (twice) <i>cuit</i>,

(baked;) whence our own <i>biscuit</i>. Biscuit might do very well, could we be

sure that it was cabin biscuit: but Salmasius argues&mdash;that in this case he

takes it to mean "<i>buccellatum, qui est panis nauticus</i>;" that is, the ship

company's biscuit, broken with a sledge-hammer. In Greek, for the benefit

again of the learned reader, it is termed [Greek: dipuros], indicating

that it has passed twice under the action of fire.</p>



<p id="id00318">"Well," you say, "No matter if it had passed fifty times&mdash;and through the

fires of Moloch; only let us have this biscuit, such as it is." In good

faith, then, fasting reader, you are not likely to see much more than you

<i>have</i> seen. It is a very Barmecide feast, we do assure you&mdash;this same

"jentaculum;" at which abstinence and patience are much more exercised than

the teeth: faith and hope are the chief graces cultivated, together with

that species of the <i>magnificum</i> which is founded on the <i>ignotum</i>. Even

this biscuit was allowed in the most limited quantities; for which reason

it is that the Greeks called this apology for a a meal by the name

of [Greek: bouchismos], a word formed (as many words were in the

Post-Augustan ages) from a Latin word&mdash;viz., <i>buccea</i>, a mouthful; not

literally such, but so much as a polished man could allow himself to put

into his mouth at once. "We took a mouthful," says Sir William Waller, the

Parliamentary general, "took a mouthful; paid our reckoning; mounted;

and were off." But there Sir William means, by his plausible "mouthful,"

something very much beyond either nine or nineteen ordinary quantities of

that denomination, whereas the Roman "jentaculum" was literally such; and,

accordingly, one of the varieties under which the ancient vocabularies

express this model of evanescent quantities is <i>gustatio</i>, a mere tasting;

and again it is called by another variety, <i>gustus</i>, a mere taste: [whence

by the usual suppression of the <i>s</i>, comes the French word for a collation

or luncheon, viz. <i>gouter</i>] Speaking of his uncle, Pliny the Younger

says&mdash;"Post solem plerumque lavabatur; deinde gustabat; dormiebat minimum;

mox, quasi alio die, studebat in coenæ tempus". "After taking the air he

bathed; after that he broke his fast on a bit of biscuit, and took a

very slight <i>siesta</i>: which done, as if awaking to a new day, he set in

regularly to his studies, and pursued them to dinner-time." <i>Gustabat</i>

here meant that nondescript meal which arose at Rome when <i>jentaculum</i> and

<i>prandium</i> were fused into one, and that only a <i>taste</i> or mouthful of

biscuit, as we shall show farther on.</p>



<p id="id00319">Possibly, however, most excellent reader, like some epicurean traveller,

who, in crossing the Alps, finds himself weather-bound at St. Bernard's

on Ash-Wednesday, you surmise a remedy: you descry some opening from "the

loopholes of retreat," through which a few delicacies might be insinuated

to spread verdure on this arid desert of biscuit. Casuistry can do much. A

dead hand at casuistry has often proved more than a match for Lent with all

his quarantines. But sorry we are to say that, in this case, no relief is

hinted at in any ancient author. A grape or two, (not a bunch of grapes,)

a raisin or two, a date, an olive&mdash;these are the whole amount of relief[6]

which the chancery of the Roman kitchen granted in such cases. All things

here hang together, and prove each other; the time, the place, the mode,

the thing. Well might man eat standing, or eat in public, such a trifle

as this. Go home to such a breakfast as this! You would as soon think of

ordering a cloth to be laid in order to eat a peach, or of asking a friend

to join you in an orange. No man makes "two bites of a cherry." So let

us pass on to the other stages of the day. Only in taking leave of this

morning stage, throw your eyes back with us, Christian reader, upon this

truly heathen meal, fit for idolatrous dogs like your Greeks and your

Romans; survey, through the vista of ages, that thrice-cursed biscuit, with

half a fig, perhaps, by way of garnish, and a huge hammer by its side, to

secure the certainty of mastication, by previous comminution. Then turn

your eyes to a Christian breakfast&mdash;hot rolls, eggs, coffee, beef; but

down, down, rebellious visions: we need say no more! You, reader, like

ourselves, will breathe a malediction on the classical era, and thank your

stars for making you a Romanticist. Every morning we thank ours for keeping

us back, and reserving us to an age in which breakfast had been already

invented. In the words of Ovid we say:&mdash;</p>



<p id="id00320">"Prisca juvent alios: ego me nunc denique natum Gratulor. Hæc ætas moribus

apta meis."</p>



<p id="id00321">Our friend, the Roman cit, has therefore thus far, in his progress through

life, obtained no breakfast, if he ever contemplated an idea so frantic.

But it occurs to you, our faithful reader, that perhaps he will not always

be thus unhappy. We could bring waggon-loads of sentiments, Greek as well

as Roman, which prove, more clearly than the most eminent pikestaff, that,

as the wheel of fortune revolves, simply out of the fact that it has

carried a man downwards, it must subsequently carry him upwards, no matter

what dislike that wheel, or any of its spokes, may bear to that man: "non,

si male nunc sit, et olim sic erit:" and that if a man, through the madness

of his nation, misses coffee and hot rolls at nine, he may easily run into

a leg of mutton at twelve. True it is he may do so: truth is commendable;

and we will not deny that a man may sometimes, by losing a breakfast, gain

a dinner. Such things have been in various ages, and will be again, but not

at Rome. There are reasons against it. We have heard of men who consider

life under the idea of a wilderness&mdash;dry as "a remainder biscuit after a

voyage:" and who consider a day under the idea of a little life. Life

is the macrocosm, or world at large; day is the microcosm, or world in

miniature. Consequently, if life is a wilderness, then day, as a little

life, is a little wilderness. And this wilderness can be safely traversed

only by having relays of fountains, or stages for refreshment. Such

stages, they conceive, are found in the several meals which Providence has

stationed at due intervals through the day, whenever the perverseness of

man does not break the chain, or derange the order of succession.</p>



<p id="id00322">These are the anchors by which man rides in that billowy ocean between

morning and night. The first anchor, viz., breakfast, having given way in

Rome, the more need there is that he should pull up by the second; and

that is often reputed to be dinner. And as your dictionary, good reader,

translated <i>breakfast</i> by that vain word <i>jentaculum</i>, so, doubtless, it

will translate <i>dinner</i> by that still vainer word <i>prandium</i>. Sincerely we

hope that your own dinner on this day, and through all time coming, may

have a better root in fact and substance than this most visionary of all

baseless things&mdash;the Roman <i>prandium</i>, of which we shall presently show you

that the most approved translation is <i>moonshine</i>.</p>



<p id="id00323">Reader, we are not jesting here. In the very spirit of serious truth, we

assure you, that the delusion about "jentaculum" is even exceeded by this

other delusion about "prandium." Salmasius himself, for whom a natural

prejudice of place and time partially obscured the truth, admits, however,

that <i>prandium</i> was a meal which the ancients rarely took; his very words

are&mdash;"<i>raro prandebant veteres</i>." Now, judge for yourself of the good sense

which is shown in translating by the word <i>dinner</i>, which must of necessity

mean the chief meal&mdash;a Roman word which represents a fancy meal, a meal of

caprice, a meal which few people took. At this moment, what is the single

point of agreement between the noon meal of the English laborer and the

evening meal of the English gentleman? What is the single circumstance

common to both, which causes us to denominate them by the common name of

<i>dinner</i>? It is that in both we recognize the <i>principal</i> meal of the

day, the meal upon which is thrown the <i>onus</i> of the day's support. In

everything else they are as wide asunder as the poles; but they agree in

this one point of their function. Is it credible that, to represent such a

meal amongst ourselves, we select a Roman word so notoriously expressing a

mere shadow, a pure apology, that very few people ever tasted it&mdash;nobody

sate down to it&mdash;not many washed their hands after it, and gradually the

very name of it became interchangeable with another name, implying the

slightest possible act of trying or sipping? "<i>Post larationem sine mensâ

prandium</i>," says Seneca, "<i>post quod non sunt lavandæ manus</i>;" that is,

"after bathing, I take a <i>prandium</i> without sitting down to table, and such

a <i>prandium</i> as brings after itself no need of washing the hands." No;

moonshine as little soils the hands as it oppresses the stomach.</p>



<p id="id00324">Reader! we, as well as Pliny, had an uncle, an East Indian uncle; doubtless

you have such an uncle; everybody has an Indian uncle. Generally such a

person is "rather yellow, rather yellow," [to quote Canning <i>versus</i> Lord

Durham:] that is the chief fault with his physics; but, as to his morals,

he is universally a man of princely aspirations and habits. He is not

always so orientally rich as he is reputed; but he is always orientally

munificent. Call upon him at any hour from two to five, he insists on your

taking <i>tiffin</i>: and such a tiffin! The English corresponding term is

luncheon: but how meagre a shadow is the European meal to its glowing

Asiatic cousin! Still, gloriously as tiffin shines, does anybody imagine

that it is a vicarious dinner, or ever meant to be the substitute of

dinner? Wait till eight, and you will have your eyes opened on that

subject. So of the Roman <i>prandium</i>: had it been as luxurious as it was

simple, still it was always viewed as something meant only to stay the

stomach, as a prologue to something beyond. The <i>prandium</i> was far enough

from giving the feeblest idea of the English luncheon; yet it stood in the

same relation to the Roman day. Now to English_men_ that meal scarcely

exists; and were it not for women, whose delicacy of organization does

not allow them to fast so long as men, would probably be abolished. It is

singular in this, as in other points, how nearly England and ancient Rome

approximate. We all know how hard it is to tempt a man generally into

spoiling his appetite, by eating before dinner. The same dislike of

violating what they called the integrity of the appetite, [<i>integram

famem</i>,] existed at Rome. Every man who knows anything of Latin critically,

sees the connection of the word <i>integer</i> with <i>in</i> and <i>tetigi</i>: <i>integer</i>

means what is <i>intact</i>, unviolated by touch. Cicero, when protesting

against spoiling his appetite for dinner, by tasting anything beforehand,

says, <i>integram famem ad coenam afferam</i>; I shall bring to dinner an

appetite untampered with. Nay, so much stress did the Romans lay on

maintaining this primitive state of the appetite undisturbed, that any

prelusions with either <i>jentaculum</i> or <i>prandium</i> were said, by a very

strong phrase indeed, <i>polluere famem</i>, to pollute the sanctity of the

appetite. The appetite was regarded as a holy vestal flame, soaring upwards

towards dinner throughout the day: if undebauched, it tended to its natural

consummation in <i>coena</i>: expired like a phoenix, to rise again out of its

own ashes. On this theory, to which language had accommodated itself, the

two prelusive meals of nine o'clock, A.M., and of one, P.M., so far from

being ratified by the public sense, and adopted into the economy of the

day, were regarded gloomily as gross irregularities, enormities, debauchers

of the natural instinct; and, in so far as they thwarted that instinct,

lessened it, or depraved it, were universally held to be full of pollution;

and, finally, to <i>profane</i> a motion of nature. Such was the language.</p>



<p id="id00325">But we guess what is passing in the reader's mind. He thinks that all this

proves the <i>prandium</i> to have been a meal of little account; and in very

many cases absolutely unknown. But still he thinks all this might happen to

the English dinner&mdash;<i>that</i> might be neglected; supper might be generally

preferred; and, nevertheless, dinner would be as truly entitled to the name

of dinner as before. Many a student neglects his dinner; enthusiasm in any

pursuit must often have extinguished appetite for all of us. Many a time

and oft did this happen to Sir Isaac Newton. Evidence is on record, that

such a deponent at eight o'clock, A.M., found Sir Isaac with one stocking

on, one off; at two, said deponent called him to dinner. Being interrogated

whether Sir Isaac had pulled on the <i>minus</i> stocking, or gartered the

<i>plus</i> stocking, witness replied that he had not. Being asked if Sir Isaac

came to dinner, replied that he did not. Being again asked, "At sunset, did

you look in on Sir Isaac?" Witness replied, "I did." "And now, upon your

conscience, sir, by the virtue of your oath, in what state were the

stockings?" <i>Ans. "In statu quo ante bellum</i>." It seems Sir Isaac had

fought through that whole battle of a long day, so trying a campaign to

many people&mdash;be had traversed that whole sandy Zaarah, without calling, or

needing to call at one of those fountains, stages, or <i>mansiones</i>,[7] by

which (according to our former explanation) Providence has relieved the

continuity of arid soil, which else disfigures that long dreary level. This

happens to all; but was dinner not dinner, and did supper become dinner,

because Sir Isaac Newton ate nothing at the first, and threw the whole

day's support upon the last? No, you will say, a rule is not defeated by

one casual deviation, nor by one person's constant deviation. Everybody

else was still dining at two, though Sir Isaac might not; and Sir Isaac

himself on most days no more deferred his dinner beyond two, than he sate

with one stocking off. But what if everybody, Sir Isaac included, had

deferred his substantial meal until night, and taken a slight refection

only at two? The question put does really represent the very case which has

happened with us in England. In 1700, a large part of London took a meal

at two, P.M., and another at seven or eight, P.M. In 1839, a large part

of London is still doing the very same thing, taking one meal at two, and

another at seven or eight. But the names are entirely changed: the two

o'clock meal used to be called <i>dinner</i>, and is now called <i>luncheon</i>; the

eight o'clock meal used to be called <i>supper</i>, and is now called <i>dinner</i>.</p>



<p id="id00326">Now the question is easily solved: because, upon reviewing the idea of

dinner, we soon perceive that time has little or no connection with it:

since, both in England and France, dinner has travelled, like the hand of a

clock, through <i>every</i> hour between ten, A.M. and ten, P.M. We have a list,

well attested, of every successive hour between these limits having been

the known established hour for the royal dinner-table within the last three

hundred and fifty years. Time, therefore, vanishes from the equation: it is

a quantity as regularly exterminated as in any algebraic problem. The true

elements of the idea, are evidently these:&mdash;1. That dinner is that meal, no

matter when taken, which is the principal meal; <i>i.e.</i> the meal on which

the day's support is thrown. 2. That it is the meal of hospitality. 3. That

it is the meal (with reference to both Nos 1 and 2) in which animal food

predominates. 4. That it is that meal which, upon necessity arising for the

abolition of all <i>but</i> one, would naturally offer itself as that one. Apply

these four tests to <i>prandium</i>:&mdash;How could that meal answer to the first

test, as <i>the day's support</i>, which few people touched? How could that meal

answer to the second test, as the <i>meal of hospitality</i>, at which nobody

sate down? How could that meal answer to the third test, as the meal of

animal food, which consisted exclusively and notoriously of bread? Or to

the fourth test, of the meal <i>entitled to survive the abolition of the

rest</i>, which was itself abolished at all times in practice?</p>



<p id="id00327">Tried, therefore, by every test, <i>prandium</i> vanishes. But we have something

further to communicate about this same <i>prandium</i>.</p>



<p id="id00328">I. It came to pass, by a very natural association of feeling, that

<i>prandium</i> and <i>jentuculum</i>, in the latter centuries of Rome, were

generally confounded. This result was inevitable. Both professed the

same basis Both came in the morning. Both were fictions. Hence they were

confounded.</p>



<p id="id00329">That fact speaks for itself,&mdash;breakfast and luncheon never could have been

confounded; but who would be at the pains of distinguishing two shadows? In

a gambling-house of that class, where you are at liberty to sit down to a

splendid banquet, anxiety probably prevents your sitting down at all; but,

if you do, the same cause prevents your noticing what you eat. So of the

two <i>pseudo</i> meals of Rome, they came in the very midst of the Roman

business; viz. from nine, A.M. to two, P.M. Nobody could give his mind

to them, had they been of better quality. There lay one cause of their

vagueness, viz.&mdash;in their position. Another cause was, the common basis of

both. Bread was so notoriously the predominating "feature" in each of these

prelusive banquets, that all foreigners at Rome, who communicated with

Romans through the Greek language, knew both the one and the other by the

name of [Greek: artositos], or the <i>bread repast</i>. Originally this name

had been restricted to the earlier meal. But a distinction without a

difference could not sustain itself: and both alike disguised their

emptiness under this pompous quadrisyllable. In the identity of substance,

therefore, lay a second ground of confusion. And, then, thirdly, even as

to the time, which had ever been the sole real distinction, there arose

from accident a tendency to converge. For it happened that while some had

<i>jentaculum</i> but no <i>prandium</i>, others had <i>prandium</i> but no <i>jentaculum</i>;

a third party had both; a fourth party, by much the largest, had neither.

Out of which varieties (who would think that a nonentity could cut up

into so many somethings?) arose a fifth party of compromisers, who,

because they could not afford a regular <i>coena</i>, and yet were

hospitably disposed, fused the two ideas into one; and so, because the

usual time for the idea of a breakfast was nine to ten, and for the idea

of a luncheon twelve to one, compromised the rival pretensions by what

diplomatists call a <i>mezzo termine</i>; bisecting the time at eleven, and

melting the two ideas into one. But by thus merging the separate times

of each, they abolished the sole real difference that had ever divided

them. Losing that, they lost all.</p>



<p id="id00330">Perhaps, as two negatives make one affirmative, it may be thought that two

layers of moonshine might coalesce into one pancake; and two Barmecide

banquets might compose one poached egg. Of that the company were the best

judges. But probably, as a rump and dozen, in our land of wagers, is

construed with a very liberal latitude as to the materials, so Martial's

invitation, "to take bread with him at eleven," might be understood by the

[Greek: sunetoi] as significant of something better than

[Greek: artositos]. Otherwise, in good truth, "moonshine and turn-out"

at eleven, A.M., would be even worse than "tea and turn-out" at eight,

P.M., which the "fervida juventus" of young England so loudly detests. But

however that might be, in this convergement of the several frontiers, and

the confusion that ensued, one cannot wonder that, whilst the two bladders

collapsed into one idea, they actually expanded into four names, two Latin

and two Greek, <i>gustus</i> and <i>gustatio</i>, [Greek: geusis], and

[Greek: geusma], which all alike express the merely tentative or

exploratory act of a <i>prægustator</i> or professional "taster" in a

king's household: what, if applied to a fluid, we should denominate

sipping.</p>



<p id="id00331">At last, by so many steps all in one direction, things had come to such

a pass&mdash;the two prelusive meals of the Roman morning, each for itself

separately vague from the beginning, had so communicated and interfused

their several and joint vaguenesses, that at last no man knew or cared to

know what any other man included in his idea of either; how much or how

little. And you might as well have hunted in the woods of Ethiopia for

Prester John, or fixed the parish of the everlasting Jew,[8] as have

attempted to say what "jentaculum" might be, or what "prandium." Only one

thing was clear&mdash;what they were <i>not</i>. Neither was or wished to be anything

that people cared for. They were both empty shadows; but shadows as they

were, we find from Cicero that they had a power of polluting and profaning

better things than themselves.</p>



<p id="id00332">We presume that no rational man will henceforth look for "dinner"&mdash;that

great idea according to Dr. Johnson&mdash;that sacred idea according to

Cicero&mdash;in a bag of moonshine on one side, or a bag of pollution on

the other. <i>Prandium</i>, so far from being what our foolish dictionaries

pretend&mdash;dinner itself&mdash;never in its palmiest days was more or other than

a miserable attempt at being <i>luncheon</i>. It was a <i>conatus</i>, what

physiologists call a <i>nisus</i>, a struggle in a very ambitious spark,

or <i>scintilla</i>, to kindle into a fire. This <i>nisus</i> went on for some

centuries; but finally issued in smoke. If <i>prandium</i> had worked out his

ambition, had "the great stream of tendency" accomplished all his wishes,

<i>prandium</i> never could have been more than a very indifferent luncheon. But

now,</p>



<p id="id00333">II. We have to offer another fact, ruinous to our dictionaries on another

ground. Various circumstances have disguised the truth, but a truth it is,

that "prandium", in its very origin and <i>incunabula</i>, never was a meal

known to the Roman <i>culina</i>. In that court it was never recognized except

as an alien. It had no original domicile in the city of Rome. It was a <i>vot

casfren-sis</i>, a word and an idea purely martial, and pointing to martial

necessities. Amongst the new ideas proclaimed to the recruit, this was

one&mdash;"Look for no '<i>coenu</i>', no regular dinner, with us. Resign these

unwarlike notions. It is true that even war has its respites; in these

it would be possible to have our Roman <i>coena</i> with all its equipage of

ministrations. Such luxury untunes the mind for doing and suffering. Let us

voluntarily renounce it; that when a necessity of renouncing it arrives, we

may not feel it among the hardships of war. From the day when you enter the

gates of the camp, reconcile yourself, tyro, to a new fashion of meal, to

what in camp dialect we call <i>prandium</i>." This "prandium," this essentially

military meal, was taken standing, by way of symbolizing the necessity of

being always ready for the enemy. Hence the posture in which it was taken

at Rome, the very counter-pole to the luxurious posture of dinner. A writer

of the third century, a period from which the Romans naturally looked back

upon everything connected with their own early habits, and with the same

kind of interest as we extend to our Alfred, (separated from us as Romulus

from them by just a thousand years,) in speaking of <i>prandium</i>, says, "Quod

dictum est <i>parandium</i>, ab eo quod milites ad bellum <i>paret</i>." Isidorus

again says, "Proprie apud veteres prandium vocatum fuisse oinnem militum

cibum ante pugnam;" i.e. "that, properly speaking, amongst our ancestors

every military meal taken before battle was termed <i>prandium</i>." According

to Isidore, the proposition is reciprocating, viz., that, as every

<i>prandium</i> was a military meal, so every military meal was called

<i>prandium</i>. But, in fact, the reason of that is apparent. Whether in the

camp or the city, the early Romans had probably but one meal in a day. That

is true of many a man amongst ourselves by choice; it is true also, to our

knowledge, of some horse regiments in our service, and may be of all. This

meal was called <i>coena</i>, or dinner in the city&mdash;<i>prandium</i> in camps. In the

city it would always be tending to one fixed hour. In the camp innumerable

accidents of war would make it very uncertain. On this account it would

be an established rule to celebrate the daily meal at noon, if nothing

hindered; not that a later hour would not have been preferred had the

choice been free; but it was better to have a certainty at a bad hour, than

by waiting for a better hour to make it an uncertainty. For it was a camp

proverb&mdash;<i>Pransus, paratus</i>; armed with his daily meal, the soldier

is ready for service. It was not, however, that all meals, as Isidore

imagined, were indiscriminately called <i>prandium</i>; but that the one sole

meal of the day, by accidents of war, might, and did, revolve through all

hours of the day.</p>



<p id="id00334">The first introduction of this military meal into Rome itself, would be

through the honorable pedantry of old centurions, &amp;c., delighting (like the

<i>Trunnions</i>, &amp;c., of our navy) to keep up in peaceful life some image or

memorial of their past experience, so wild, so full of peril, excitement,

and romance, as Roman warfare must have been in those ages. Many

non-military people for health's sake, many as an excuse for eating early,

many by way of interposing some refreshment between the stages of forensic

business, would adopt this hurried and informal meal. Many would wish to

see their sons adopting such a meal as a training for foreign service in

particular, and for temperance in general. It would also be maintained by a

solemn and very interesting commemoration of this camp repast in Rome.</p>



<p id="id00335">This commemoration, because it has been grossly misunderstood by Salmasius,

(whose error arose from not marking the true point of a particular

antithesis,) and still more, because it is a distinct confirmation of all

we have said as to the military nature of <i>prandium</i>, we shall detach from

the series of our illustrations, by placing it in a separate paragraph.</p>



<p id="id00336">On a set day the officers of the army were invited by Cæsar to a banquet;

it was a circumstance expressly noticed in the invitation, by the proper

officers of the palace, that the banquet was not a "coena," but a

"prandium." What followed, in consequence? Why, that all the guests sate

down in full military accoutrement; whereas, observes the historian, had it

been a coena, the officers would have unbelted their swords; for, he adds,

even in Cæsar's presence the officers lay aside their swords. The word

<i>prandium</i>, in short, converted the palace into the imperial tent; and

Cæsar was no longer a civil emperor and <i>princeps senatûs</i>, but became a

commander-in-chief amongst a council of his staff, all belted and plumed,

and in full military fig.</p>



<p id="id00337">On this principle we come to understand why it is, that, whenever the Latin

poets speak of an army as taking food, the word used is always <i>prandens</i>

and <i>pransus</i>; and, when the word used is <i>prandens</i>, then always it is an

army that is concerned. Thus Juvenal in a well-known satire&mdash;</p>



<p id="id00338">  &mdash;&mdash;"Credimus altos<br/>



  Desiccasse amnes, epotaque ftumina, Medo <i>Prandente</i>."<br/>

</p>



<p id="id00339">Not <i>coenante</i>, observe: you might as well talk of an army taking tea

and toast. Nor is that word ever applied to armies. It is true that the

converse is not so rigorously observed: nor ought it, from the explanations

already given. Though no soldier dined, (<i>coenabat</i>,) yet the citizen

sometimes adopted the camp usage and took a <i>prandium</i>. But generally the

poets use the word merely to mark the time of day. In that most humorous

appeal of Perseus&mdash;"Cur quis non prandeat, hoc est?" "Is this a sufficient

reason for losing one's <i>prandium</i>?" He was obliged to say <i>prandium</i>,

because no exhibitions ever could cause a man to lose his <i>coenia</i>, since

none were displayed at a time of day when anybody in Rome would have

attended. Just as, in alluding to a parliamentary speech notoriously

delivered at midnight, an English satirist must have said, Is this a speech

to furnish an argument for leaving one's bed?&mdash;not as what stood foremost

in his regard, but as the only thing that <i>could</i> be lost at the time of

night.</p>



<p id="id00340">On this principle, also, viz. by going back to the military origin of

<i>prandium</i>, we gain the interpretation of all the peculiarities attached to

it; viz.&mdash;1, its early hour&mdash;2, its being taken in a standing posture&mdash;3,

in the open air&mdash;4, the humble quality of its materials&mdash;bread and biscuit,

(the main articles of military fare.) In all these circumstances of the

meal, we read, most legibly written, the exotic and military character of

the meal.</p>



<p id="id00341">Thus we have brought down our Roman friend to noonday, or even one hour

later than noon, and to this moment the poor man has had nothing to eat.

For, supposing him to be not <i>impransus</i>, and supposing him <i>jentâsse</i>

beside; yet it is evident, (we hope,) that neither one nor the other means

more than what it was often called, viz. [Greek: Bouchismos], or, in

plain English, a mouthful. How long do we intend to keep him waiting?

Reader, he will dine at three, or (supposing dinner put off to the latest)

at four. Dinner was never known to be later than the tenth hour in Rome,

which in summer would be past five; but for a far greater proportion of

days would be near four in Rome, except for one or two of the emperors,

whom the mere business attached to their unhappy station kept sometimes

dinnerless till six. And so entirely was a Roman the creature of ceremony,

that a national mourning would probably have been celebrated, and the "sad

augurs" would have been called in to expiate the prodigy, had the general

dinner lingered beyond four.</p>



<p id="id00342">But, meantime, what has our friend been about since perhaps six or seven in

the morning? After paying his little homage to his <i>patronus</i>, in what

way has he fought with the great enemy Time since then? Why, reader, this

illustrates one of the most interesting features in the Roman character.

The Roman was the idlest of men. "Man and boy," he was "an idler in the

land." He called himself and his pals "rerum dominos, gentemque togatam;"

<i>the gentry that wore the toga</i>. Yes, and a pretty affair that "toga" was.

Just figure to yourself, reader, the picture of a hardworking man, with

horny hands like our hedgers, ditchers, weavers, porters, &amp;c., setting to

work on the highroad in that vast sweeping toga, filling with a strong

gale like the mainsail of a frigate. Conceive the roars with which this

magnificent figure would be received into the bosom of a poor-house

detachment sent out to attack the stones on some new line of road, or a

fatigue party of dustmen sent upon secret service. Had there been nothing

left as a memorial of the Romans but that one relic&mdash;their immeasurable

toga,[9]&mdash;we should have known that they were born and bred to idleness. In

fact, except in war, the Roman never did anything at all but sun himself.

<i>Ut se apricaret</i> was the final cause of peace in his opinion; in literal

truth, that he might make an <i>apricot</i> of himself. The public rations at

all times supported the poorest inhabitant of Rome if he were a citizen.

Hence it was that Hadrian was so astonished with the spectacle of

Alexandria, "<i>civitas opulenta, fæcunda, in qua nemo vivat otiosus</i>." Here

first he saw the spectacle of a vast city, second only to Rome, where every

man had something to do; "<i>podagrosi quod agant habent; habent cæci quod

faciant; ne chiragrici</i>" (those with gout in the fingers) "<i>apud eos otiosi

vivunt</i>." No poor rates levied upon the rest of the world for the benefit

of their own paupers were there distributed <i>gratis</i>. The prodigious

spectacle (so it seemed to Hadrian) was exhibited in Alexandria, of all men

earning their bread in the sweat of their brow. In Rome only, (and at one

time in some of the Grecian states,) it was the very meaning of <i>citizen</i>

that he could vote and be idle.</p>



<p id="id00343">In these circumstances, where the whole sum of life's duties amounted

to voting, all the business a man <i>could</i> have was to attend the public

assemblies, electioneering, or factious. These, and any judicial trial

(public or private) that might happen to interest him for the persons

concerned, or for the questions, amused him through the morning; that

is, from eight till one. He might also extract some diversion from

the <i>columnæ</i>, or pillars of certain porticoes to which they pasted

advertisements. These <i>affiches</i> must have been numerous; for all the girls

in Rome who lost a trinket, or a pet bird, or a lap-dog, took this mode of

angling in the great ocean of the public for the missing articles.</p>



<p id="id00344">But all this time we take for granted that there were no shows in a course

of exhibition, either the dreadful ones of the amphitheatre, or the

bloodless ones of the circus. If there were, then that became the business

of all Romans; and it was a business which would have occupied him from

daylight until the light began to fail. Here we see another effect from the

scarcity of artificial light amongst the ancients. These magnificent shows

went on by daylight. But how incomparably greater would have been the

splendor by lamp-light! What a gigantic conception! Eighty thousand human

faces all revealed under one blaze of lamp-light! Lord Bacon saw the mighty

advantage of candle-light for the pomps and glories of this world. But the

poverty of the earth was the ultimate cause that the Pagan shows proceeded

by day. Not that the masters of the world, who rained Arabian odors and

perfumed waters of the most costly description from a thousand fountains,

simply to cool the summer heats, would have regarded the expense of light;

cedar and other odorous woods burning upon vast altars, together with every

variety of fragrant torch, would have created light enough to shed a new

day over the distant Adriatic.</p>



<p id="id00345">However, as there are no public spectacles, we will suppose, and the courts

or political meetings, (if not closed altogether by superstition,) would at

any rate be closed in the ordinary course by twelve or one o'clock, nothing

remains for him to do, before returning home, except perhaps to attend the

<i>palæstra</i>, or some public recitation of a poem written by a friend, but in

any case to attend the public baths. For these the time varied; and many

people have thought it tyrannical in some of the Cæsars that they imposed

restraints on the time open for the baths; some, for instance, would not

suffer them to open at all before two, and in any case, if you were later

than four or five in summer, you would have to pay a fine which most

effectually cleaned out the baths of all raff, since it was a sum that

<i>John Quires</i> could not have produced to save his life. But it should be

considered that the emperor was the steward of the public resources for

maintaining the baths in fuel, oil, attendance, repairs. We are prepared

to show, on a fitting occasion, that every fourth person[10] amongst the

citizens bathed daily, and non-citizens, of course, paid an <i>extra</i> sum.

Now the population of Rome was far larger than has ever been hinted at

except by Lipsius. But certain it is, that during the long peace of the

first Cæsars, and after the <i>annonaria prorisio</i>, (that great pledge of

popularity to a Roman prince,) had been increased by the corn tribute from

the Nile, the Roman population took an immense lurch ahead. The subsequent

increase of baths, whilst no old ones were neglected, proves <i>that</i>

decisively. And as citizenship expanded by means of the easy terms on which

it could be had, so did the bathers multiply. The population of Rome in the

century after Augustus, was far greater than during that era; and this,

still acting as a vortex to the rest of the world, may have been one great

motive with Constantine for "transferring" the capital eastwards; in

reality, for breaking up one monster capital into two of more manageable

dimensions. Two o'clock was often the earliest hour at which the public

baths were opened. But in Martial's time a man could go without blushing

(<i>salvâ fronte</i>) at eleven, though even then two o'clock was the meridian

hour for the great uproar of splashing, and swimming, and "larking" in the

endless baths of endless Rome.</p>



<p id="id00346">And now, at last, bathing finished, and the exercises of the <i>palæstra</i>, at

half-past two, or three, our friend finds his way home&mdash;not again to leave

it for that day. He is now a new man; refreshed, oiled with perfumes, his

dust washed off by hot water, and ready for enjoyment. These were the

things that determined the time for dinner. Had there been no other proof

that <i>coena</i> was the Roman dinner, this is an ample one. Now first the

Roman was fit for dinner, in a condition of luxurious ease; business

ever&mdash;that day's load of anxiety laid aside&mdash;his <i>cuticle</i>, as he delighted

to talk, cleansed and polished&mdash;nothing more to do or to think of until

the next morning, he might now go and dine, and get drunk with a safe

conscience. Besides, if he does not get dinner now, when will he get it?

For most demonstrably he has taken nothing yet which comes near in value

to that basin of soup which many of ourselves take at the Roman hour of

bathing. No; we have kept our man fasting as yet. It is to be hoped that

something is coming at last.</p>



<p id="id00347">It <i>does</i> come,&mdash;dinner, the great meal of "coena;" the meal sacred to

hospitality and genial pleasure, comes now to fill up the rest of the day,

until light fails altogether.</p>



<p id="id00348">Many people are of opinion that the Romans only understood what the

capabilities of dinner were. It is certain that they were the first great

people that discovered the true secret and meaning of dinner, the great

office which it fulfils, and which we in England are now so generally

acting on. Barbarous nations,&mdash;and none were, in that respect, more

barbarous than our own ancestors,&mdash;made this capital blunder; the brutes,

if you asked them what was the use of dinner, what it was meant for, stared

at you and replied&mdash;as a horse would reply if you put the same question

about his provender&mdash;that it was to give him strength for finishing his

work! Therefore, if you point your telescope back to antiquity about twelve

or one o'clock in the daytime, you will descry our most worthy ancestors

all eating for their very lives, eating as dogs eat, viz. in bodily fear

that some other dog will come and take their dinner away. What swelling of

the veins in the temples! (see Boswell's natural history of Dr. Johnson at

dinner;) what intense and rapid deglutition! what odious clatter of knives

and plates! what silence of the human voice! what gravity! what fury in the

libidinous eyes with which they contemplate the dishes! Positively it was

an <i>indecent</i> spectacle to see Dr. Johnson at dinner. But, above all, what

maniacal haste and hurry, as if the fiend were waiting with red-hot pincers

to lay hold of the hindermost!</p>



<p id="id00349">Oh, reader, do you recognize in this abominable picture your respected

ancestors and ours? Excuse us for saying&mdash;"What monsters!" We have a right

to call our own ancestors monsters; and, if so, we must have the same right

over yours. For Dr. Southey has shown plainly in the "Doctor," that every

man having four grand parents in the second stage of ascent, (each of whom

having four, therefore,) sixteen in the third, and so on, long before you

get to the Conquest, every man and woman then living in England will be

wanted to make up the sum of my separate ancestors; consequently, you must

take your ancestors out of the very same fund, or (if you are too proud for

that) you must go without ancestors. So that, your ancestors being clearly

mine, I have a right in law to call the whole "kit" of them monsters. <i>Quod

erat demonstrandum</i>. Really and upon our honor, it makes one, for the

moment, ashamed of one's descent; one would wish to disinherit one's-self

backwards, and (as Sheridan says in the <i>Rivals</i>) to "cut the connection."

Wordsworth has an admirable picture in Peter Bell of "A snug party in a

parlor," removed into <i>limbus patrum</i> for their offences in the flesh:&mdash;</p>



<p id="id00350">  "Cramming, as they on earth were cramm'd;<br/>



  All sipping wine, all sipping tea;<br/>



  But, as you by their faces see,<br/>



  All silent, and all d&mdash;d."<br/>

</p>



<p id="id00351">How well does that one word describe those venerable ancestral

dinners&mdash;"All silent!" Contrast this infernal silence of voice and fury

of eye with the "risus amabilis," the festivity, the social kindness, the

music, the wine, the "dulcis insania," of a Roman "coena." We mentioned

four tests for determining what meal is, and what is not, dinner; we may

now add a fifth, viz. the spirit of festal joy and elegant enjoyment, of

anxiety laid aside, and of honorable social pleasure put on like a marriage

garment.</p>



<p id="id00352">And what caused the difference between our ancestors and the Romans? Simply

this&mdash;the error of interposing dinner in the middle of business, thus

courting all the breezes of angry feeling that may happen to blow from the

business yet to come, instead of finishing, absolutely closing, the account

with this world's troubles before you sit down. That unhappy interpolation

ruined all. Dinner was an ugly little parenthesis between two still uglier

clauses of a tee-totally ugly sentence. Whereas with us, their enlightened

posterity, to whom they have the honor to be ancestors, dinner is a great

reaction. There lies our conception of the matter. It grew out of the very

excess of the evil. When business was moderate, dinner was allowed to

divide and bisect it. When it swelled into that vast strife and agony, as

one may call it, that boils along the tortured streets of modern London or

other capitals, men began to see the necessity of an adequate counterforce

to push against this overwhelming torrent, and thus maintain the

equilibrium. Were it not for the soft relief of a six o'clock dinner, the

gentle manner succeeding to the boisterous hubbub of the day, the soft

glowing lights, the wine, the intellectual conversation, life in London is

now come to such a pass, that in two years all nerves would sink before it.

But for this periodic reaction, the modern business which draws so cruelly

on the brain, and so little on the hands, would overthrow that organ in

all but those of coarse organization. Dinner it is,&mdash;meaning by dinner

the whole complexity of attendant circumstances,&mdash;which saves the modern

brain-working men from going mad.</p>



<p id="id00353">This revolution as to dinner was the greatest in virtue and value ever

accomplished. In fact, those are always the most operative revolutions

which are brought about through social or domestic changes. A nation must

be barbarous, neither could it have much intellectual business, which dined

in the morning. They could not be at ease in the morning. So much must be

granted: every day has its separate <i>quantum</i>, its dose (as the doctrinists

of rent phrase it) of anxiety, that could not be digested so soon as noon.

No man will say it. He, therefore, who dined at noon, was willing to sit

down squalid as he was, with his dress unchanged, his cares not washed off.

And what follows from that? Why, that to him, to such a canine or cynical

specimen of the genus <i>homo</i>, dinner existed only as a physical event, a

mere animal relief, a mere carnal enjoyment. For what, we demand, did this

fleshly creature differ from the carrion crow, or the kite, or the vulture,

or the cormorant? A French judge, in an action upon a wager, laid it down

in law, that man only had a <i>bouche</i>, all other animals had a <i>gueule</i>:

only with regard to the horse, in consideration of his beauty, nobility,

use, and in honor of the respect with which man regarded him, by the

courtesy of Christendom, he might be allowed to have a <i>bouche</i>, and his

reproach of brutality, if not taken away, might thus be hidden. But surely,

of the rabid animal who is caught dining at noonday, the <i>homo ferus</i>, who

affronts the meridian sun like Thyestes and Atreus, by his inhuman meals,

we are, by parity of reason, entitled to say, that he has a "maw," (so has

Milton's Death,) but nothing resembling stomach. And to this vile man a

philosopher would say&mdash;"Go away, sir, and come back to me two or three

centuries hence, when you have learned to be a reasonable creature, and to

make that physico-intellectual thing out of dinner which it was meant to

be, and is capable of becoming." In Henry VII.'s time the court dined at

eleven in the forenoon. But even that hour was considered so shockingly

late in the French court, that Louis XII. actually had his gray hairs

brought down with sorrow to the grave, by changing his regular hour of

half-past nine for eleven, in gallantry to his young English bride.[11] He

fell a victim to late hours in the forenoon. In Cromwell's time they dined

at one, P.M. One century and a half had carried them on by two hours.

Doubtless, old cooks and scullions wondered what the world would come to

next. Our French neighbors were in the same predicament. But they far

surpassed us in veneration for the meal. They actually dated from it.

Dinner constituted the great era of the day. <i>L'apres diner</i> is almost the

sole date which you find in Cardinal De Retz's memoirs of the <i>Fronde</i>.

Dinner was their <i>Hegira</i>&mdash;dinner was their <i>line</i> in traversing the ocean

of day: they crossed the equator when they dined. Our English revolution

came next; it made some little difference, we have heard people say, in

Church and State; but its great effects were perceived in dinner. People

now dined at two. So dined Addison for his last thirty years; so dined

Pope, who was coeval with the revolution through his entire life. Precisely

as the rebellion of 1745 arose, did people (but observe, very great people)

advance to four, P.M. Philosophers, who watch the "semina rerum," and the

first symptoms of change, had perceived this alteration singing in the

upper air like a coming storm some little time before. About the year 1740,

Pope complains to a friend of Lady Suffolk's dining so late as four. Young

people may bear those things, he observes; but as to himself, now turned

of fifty, if such doings went on, if Lady Suffolk would adopt such strange

hours, he must really absent himself from Marble Hill. Lady Suffolk had a

right to please herself: he himself loved her. But if she would persist,

all which remained for a decayed poet was respectfully to "cut his stick,

and retire." Whether Pope ever put up with four o'clock dinners again, we

have vainly sought to fathom. Some things advance continuously, like a

flood or a fire, which always make an end of A, eat and digest it, before

they go on to B. Other things advance <i>per saltum</i>&mdash;they do not silently

cancer their way onwards, but lie as still as a snake after they have made

some notable conquest, then when unobserved they make themselves up "for

mischief," and take a flying bound onwards. Thus advanced dinner, and by

these fits got into the territory of evening. And ever as it made a motion

onwards, it found the nation more civilized, (else the change would not

have been effected,) and raised them to a still higher civilization. The

next relay on that line of road, the next repeating frigate, is Cowper in

his poem on <i>Conversation</i>. He speaks of four o'clock as still the elegant

hour for dinner&mdash;the hour for the <i>lautiores</i> and the <i>lepidi homines</i>. Now

this was written about 1780, or a little earlier; perhaps, therefore,

just one generation after Pope's Lady Suffolk. But then Cowper was living

amongst the rural gentry, not in high life; yet, again, Cowper was nearly

connected by blood with the eminent Whig house of Cowper, and acknowledged

as a <i>kinsman</i>. About twenty-five years after this, we may take Oxford as

a good exponent of the national advance. As a magnificent body of

"foundations," endowed by kings, and resorted to by the flower of the

national youth, Oxford is always elegant and even splendid in her habits.

Yet, on the other hand, as a grave seat of learning, and feeling the weight

of her position in the commonwealth, she is slow to move: she is inert as

she should be, having the functions of <i>resistance</i> assigned to her against

the popular instinct of <i>movement</i>. Now, in Oxford, about 1804-5, there was

a general move in the dinner hour. Those colleges who dined at three, of

which there were still several, now dined at four; those who had dined

at four, now translated their hour to five. These continued good general

hours, but still amongst the more intellectual orders, till about Waterloo.

After that era, six, which had been somewhat of a gala hour, was promoted

to the fixed station of dinner-time in ordinary; and there perhaps it will

rest through centuries. For a more festal dinner, seven, eight, nine, ten,

have all been in requisition since then; but we have not yet heard of any

man's dining later than 10, P.M., except in that single classical instance

(so well remembered from our father Joe) of an Irishman who must have dined

<i>much</i> later than ten, because his servant protested, when others were

enforcing the dignity of their masters by the lateness of their dinner

hours, that <i>his</i> master dined "to-morrow."</p>



<p id="id00354">Were the Romans not as barbarous as our own ancestors at one time? Most

certainly they were; in their primitive ages they took their <i>coena</i> at

noon,[12] <i>that</i> was before they had laid aside their barbarism; before

they shaved: it was during their barbarism, and in consequence of their

barbarism, that they timed their <i>coena</i> thus unseasonably. And this is

made evident by the fact, that, so long as they erred in the hour, they

erred in the attending circumstances. At this period they had no music

at dinner, no festal graces, and no reposing upon sofas. They sate bolt

upright in chairs, and were as grave as our ancestors, as rabid, and

doubtless as furiously in haste.</p>



<p id="id00355">With us the revolution has been equally complex. We do not, indeed, adopt

the luxurious attitude of semi-recumbency; our climate makes that less

requisite; and, moreover, the Romans had no knives and forks, which could

scarcely be used in that posture: they ate with their fingers from dishes

already cut up&mdash;whence the peculiar force of Seneca's "post quod non sunt

lavandæ manus." But exactly in proportion as our dinner has advanced

towards evening, have we and has that advanced in circumstances of

elegance, of taste, of intellectual value." That by itself would be much.

Infinite would be the gain for any people that it had ceased to be

brutal, animal, fleshly; ceased to regard the chief meal of the day as a

ministration only to an animal necessity; that they had raised it to a far

higher standard; associated it with social and humanizing feelings,

with manners, with graces both moral and intellectual; moral in the

self-restraint; intellectual in the fact, notorious to all men, that the

chief arenas for the <i>easy</i> display of intellectual power are at our dinner

tables. But dinner has <i>now</i> even a greater function than this; as the

fervor of our day's business increases, dinner is continually more needed

in its office of a great <i>reaction</i>. We repeat that, at this moment, but

for the daily relief of dinner, the brain of all men who mix in the strife

of capitals would be unhinged and thrown off its centre.</p>



<p id="id00356">If we should suppose the case of a nation taking three equidistant meals

all of the same material and the same quantity, all milk, for instance, it

would be impossible for Thomas Aquinas himself to say which was or was not

dinner. The case would be that of the Roman <i>ancile</i> which dropped from

the skies; to prevent its ever being stolen, the priests made eleven

<i>facsimiles</i> of it, that the thief, seeing the hopelessness of

distinguishing the true one, might let all alone. And the result was, that,

in the next generation, nobody could point to the true one. But our dinner,

the Roman <i>coena</i>, is distinguished from the rest by far more than the

hour; it is distinguished by great functions, and by still greater

capacities. It <i>is</i> most beneficial; it may become more so.</p>



<p id="id00357">In saying this, we point to the lighter graces of music, and conversation

<i>more varied</i>, by which the Roman <i>coena</i> was chiefly distinguished from

our dinner. We are far from agreeing with Mr. Croly, that the Roman meal

was more "intellectual" than ours. On the contrary, ours is the more

intellectual by much; we have far greater knowledge, far greater means

for making it such. In fact, the fault of our meal is&mdash;that it is <i>too</i>

intellectual; of too severe a character; too political; too much tending,

in many hands, to disquisition. Reciprocation of question and answer,

variety of topics, shifting of topics, are points not sufficiently

cultivated. In all else we assent to the following passage from Mr. Croly's

eloquent Salathiel:&mdash;</p>



<p id="id00358">"If an ancient Roman could start from his slumber into the midst of

European life, he must look with scorn on its absence of grace, elegance,

and fancy. But it is in its festivity, and most of all in its banquets,

that he would feel the incurable barbarism of the Gothic blood. Contrasted

with the fine displays that made the table of the Roman noble a picture,

and threw over the indulgence of appetite the colors of the imagination,

with what eyes must he contemplate the tasteless and commonplace dress,

the coarse attendants, the meagre ornament, the want of mirth, music, and

intellectual interest&mdash;the whole heavy machinery that converts the feast

into the mere drudgery of devouring!"</p>



<p id="id00359">Thus far the reader knows already that we dissent violently; and by looking

back he will see a picture of our ancestors at dinner, in which they

rehearse the very part in relation to ourselves that Mr. Croly supposes

all moderns to rehearse in relation to the Romans; but in the rest of the

beautiful description, the positive, though not the comparative part, we

must all concur:&mdash;</p>



<p id="id00360">"The guests before me were fifty or sixty splendidly dressed men,"

(they were in fact Titus and his staff, then occupied with the siege of

Jerusalem,) "attended by a crowd of domestics, attired with scarcely less

splendor; for no man thought of coming to the banquet in the robes of

ordinary life. The embroidered couches, themselves striking objects,

allowed the ease of position at once delightful in the relaxing climates of

the South, and capable of combining with every grace of the human figure.

At a slight distance, the table loaded with plate glittering under a

profusion of lamps, and surrounded by couches thus covered by rich

draperies, was like a central source of light radiating in broad shafts of

every brilliant hue. The wealth of the patricians, and their intercourse

with the Greeks, made them masters of the first performances of the arts.

Copies of the most famous statues, and groups of sculpture in the precious

metals; trophies of victories; models of temples; were mingled with vases

of flowers and lighted perfumes. Finally, covering and closing all, was

a vast scarlet canopy, which combined the groups beneath to the eye, and

threw the whole into the form that a painter would love."</p>



<p id="id00361">Mr. Croly then goes on to insist on the intellectual embellishments of the

Roman dinner; their variety, their grace, their adaptation to a festive

purpose. The truth is, our English imagination, more profound than the

Roman, is also more gloomy, less gay, less <i>riante</i>. That accounts for our

want of the gorgeous <i>trictinium</i>, with its scarlet draperies, and for many

other differences both to the eye and to the understanding. But both we and

the Romans agree in the main point; we both discovered the true purpose

which dinner might serve,&mdash;1, to throw the grace of intellectual enjoyment

over an animal necessity; 2, to relieve and antagonize the toil of brain

incident to high forms of social life.</p>



<p id="id00362">Our object has been to point the eye to this fact; to show uses imperfectly

suspected in a recurring accident of life; to show a steady tendency to

that consummation, by holding up, as in a mirror, (together with occasional

glimpses of hidden corners in history,) the corresponding revolution

silently going on in a great people of antiquity.</p>



<h3 id="id00363" style="margin-top: 3em">NOTES.</h3>



<h4 id="id00364" style="margin-top: 2em">[NOTE 1.</h4>



<p id="id00365">"<i>In procinct</i>."&mdash;Milton's translation (somewhere in The Paradise Regained)

of the technical phrase "in procinctu."]</p>



<h5 id="id00366">[NOTE 2.</h5>



<p id="id00367">"<i>Geologists know not</i>."&mdash;Observe, reader, we are not at all questioning

the Scriptural Chronology of the earth as a <i>habitation for man</i>, for on

the pre-human earth Scripture is silent: not upon the six thousand years

does our doubt revolve, but upon a very different thing, viz. to what age

in man these six thousand years correspond by analogy in a planet. In man

the sixtieth part is a very venerable age. But as to a planet, as to our

little earth, instead of arguing dotage, six thousand years may have

scarcely carried her beyond babyhood. Some people think she is cutting her

first teeth; some think her in her teens. But, seriously, it is a very

interesting problem. Do the sixty centuries of our earth imply youth,

maturity, or dotage?]</p>



<h5 id="id00368">[NOTE 3.</h5>



<p id="id00369">"<i>Everywhere the ancients went to bed, like good boys, from seven to nine

o'clock</i>."&mdash;As we are perfectly serious, we must beg the reader, who

fancies any joke in all this, to consider what an immense difference

it must have made to the earth, considered as a steward of her own

resources-whether great nations, in a period when their resources were so

feebly developed, did, or did not, for many centuries, require candles;

and, we may add, fire. The five heads of human expenditure are,&mdash;1, Food;

2, Shelter; 3, Clothing; 4, Fuel; 5, Light. All were pitched on a lower

scale in the Pagan era; and the two last were almost banished from ancient

housekeeping. What a great relief this must have been to our good mother

the earth! who, at <i>first</i>, was obliged to request of her children that

they would settle round the Mediterranean. She could not even afford them

water, unless they would come and fetch it themselves out of a common tank

or cistern.]</p>



<h5 id="id00370">[NOTE 4.</h5>



<p id="id00371">"<i>The manesalutantes</i>."&mdash;There can be no doubt that the <i>levees</i> of modern

princes and ministers have been inherited from this ancient usage of Rome;

one which belonged to Rome republican, as well as Rome imperial. The

fiction in our modern practice is&mdash;that we wait upon the <i>levé</i>, or rising

of the prince. In France, at one era, this fiction was realized: the

courtiers did really attend the king's dressing. And, as to the queen, even

up to the revolution, Marie Antoinette almost from necessity gave audience

at her toilette.]</p>



<h5 id="id00372">[NOTE 5.</h5>



<p id="id00373">"<i>Or again, 'siccum pro biscodo, ut hodie vocamus, sumemus</i>?'"&mdash;It is odd

enough that a scholar so complete as Salmasius, whom nothing ever escapes,

should have overlooked so obvious an alternative as that of <i>siccus</i>,

meaning without <i>opsonium&mdash;Scoticè</i>, without "kitchen."]</p>



<h5 id="id00374">[NOTE 6.</h5>



<p id="id00375">"<i>The whole amount of relief</i>;"&mdash;from which it appears how grossly Locke

(see his <i>Education</i>) was deceived in fancying that Augustus practised any

remarkable abstinence in taking only a bit of bread and a raisin or two, by

way of luncheon. Augustus did no more than most people did; secondly, he

abstained only with a view to dinner; and, thirdly, for this dinner he

never waited longer than up to four o'clock.]</p>



<h5 id="id00376">[NOTE 7.</h5>



<p id="id00377">"<i>Mansiones</i>"&mdash;the halts of the Roman legions, the stationary places of

repose which divided the marches, were so called.]</p>



<h5 id="id00378">[NOTE 8.</h5>



<p id="id00379">"<i>The everlasting Jew</i>;"&mdash;the German name for what we English call the

Wandering Jew. The German imagination has been most struck with the

duration of the man's life, and his unhappy sanctity from death; the

English by the unrestingness of the man's life, his incapacity of repose.]</p>



<h5 id="id00380">[NOTE 9.</h5>



<p id="id00381">"<i>Immeasurable toga</i>."&mdash;It is very true that in the time of Augustus the

<i>toga</i> had disappeared amongst the lowest plebs, and greatly Augustus was

shocked at that spectacle. It is a very curious fact in itself, especially

as expounding the main cause of the civil wars. Mere poverty, and the

absence of bribery from Rome, whilst all popular competition for offices

drooped, can alone explain this remarkable revolution of dress.]</p>



<h5 id="id00382">[NOTE 10.</h5>



<p id="id00383">That boys in the Prætexta did not bathe in the public baths, is certain;

and most unquestionably that is the meaning of the expression in Juvenal

so much disputed&mdash;"Nisi qui nondum <i>ære</i> lavantur." By <i>æs</i> he means the

<i>ahenum</i>, a common name for the public bath, which was made of copper; in

our navy, "the <i>coppers</i>" is a name for the boilers. "Nobody believes in

such tales except children," is the meaning. This one exclusion cut off

three eighths of the Roman males.]</p>



<h5 id="id00384">[NOTE 11.</h5>



<p id="id00385">"<i>His young&mdash;English bride</i>."&mdash;The case of an old man, or one reputed

old, marrying a very girlish wife, is always too much for the gravity of

history; and, rather than lose the joke, the historian prudently disguises

the age, which, after all, was little above fifty. And the very persons

who insist on the late dinner as the proximate cause of death, elsewhere

insinuate something else, not so decorously expressed. It is odd that this

amiable prince, so memorable as having been a martyr to late dining at

eleven, A.M., was the same person who is so equally memorable for the noble

answer about a King of France not remembering the wrongs of a Duke of

Orleans.]</p>



<h5 id="id00386">[NOTE 12.</h5>



<p id="id00387">"<i>Took their coena at noon</i>."&mdash;And, by the way, in order to show how little

<i>coena</i> had to do with any evening hour (though, in any age but that of our

fathers, four in the afternoon would never have been thought an evening

hour in the sense implied by <i>supper</i>,)&mdash;the Roman <i>gourmands</i> and <i>bons

vivants</i> continued through the very last ages of Rome to take their coena,

when more than usually sumptuous, at noon. This, indeed, all people did

occasionally, just as we sometimes give a dinner even now so early as four,

P.M., under the name of a <i>dejeuner à la fourchette</i>. Those who took their

<i>coena</i> so early as this, were said <i>de die coenare</i>&mdash;to begin dining from

high day. Just as the line in Horace&mdash;"Ut jugulent homines surgunt <i>de

nocte</i> latrones," does not mean that the robbers rise when others are going

to bed, viz., at nightfall, but at midnight. For, says one of the three

best scholars of this earth, <i>de die, de nocte</i>, mean from that hour

which was most fully, most intensely day or night, viz., the centre, the

meridian. This one fact is surely a clencher as to the question whether

<i>coena</i> meant dinner or supper.]</p>

<h4 id="id00424" style="margin-top: 2em">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>



<p id="id00425">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers

including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from

people in all walks of life.</p>



<p id="id00426">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

<h5 id="id00431">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Literary Archive Foundation</h5>



<p id="id00432">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

status with the IRS.</p>



<p id="id00433">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations

where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

particular state visit http://pglaf.org</p>



<p id="id00434">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

approach us with offers to donate.</p>



<p id="id00435">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>



<p id="id00436">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other

ways including including checks, online payments and credit card

donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate</p>



<h4 id="id00437" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

works.</h4>



<p id="id00438">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared

with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project

Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>



<p id="id00439">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed

editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.

unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily

keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>



<p id="id00440">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's

eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,

compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>



<p id="id00441">Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over

the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.

VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving

new filenames and etext numbers.</p>



<p id="id00442">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>



<p id="id00443">     http://www.gutenberg.net<br/>

</p>



<p id="id00444">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>



<p id="id00445">EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,

are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to

download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular

search system you may utilize the following addresses and just

download by the etext year.</p>



<p id="id00446">     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06<br/>

</p>



<p id="id00447">    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,<br/>



     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)<br/>

</p>



<p id="id00448">EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are

filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part

of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is

identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single

digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For

example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:</p>



<p id="id00449">     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234<br/>

</p>



<p id="id00450">or filename 24689 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689</p>



<p id="id00451">An alternative method of locating eBooks:
