Throughout the \"Four Quartets\", Eliot is concerned with patterns and patterning; here, he is deliberately playing with sound patterns, introducing a kind of Elizabethan lyric with a sing-song rhythm.

Now,&nbsp; the revolving wheel was a common image in the Renaissance signifying a) the fickle course of Fortune, and b) the union of opposites. Of course, what could be more opposed to beautiful, precious stones than garlic? The reason why garlic and sapphires in the mud (a further degradation of the beautiful) are put together on this wheel is that the Renaissance, being&nbsp;an age of alchemy and magic, believed in the hidden connection between all things. Paradoxically, opposites were believed to be strange, distorted mirrors of each other. \"As above, so below.\" The idea is that&nbsp;placing garlic and sapphires onto this revolving wheel will somehow reveal the hidden pattern of similarity between them. </p>'", "deleted_on": " NULL", "id": 589, "start_index": 351},{"rating": " 0", "user_id": 3, "quote": " 'SCENE I.  /  ", "section_id": 26, "end_index": 2, "created_on": " 2007-09-17 14:47:26", "published": 1, "annotation": " 'The only available text for <u>Macbeth</u> is the one printed in the first edition of Shakespeare''s collected works, usually called the First Folio (1623, seven years after the playwright''s death).

-- you know that word!&nbsp; It refers to the genital region, and whenever it''s used, it conjures up the idea of sex.&nbsp; Shakespeare chooses to say \"the families had children\" in a way that draws our attention to sex.&nbsp; The adjective \"fatal,\" which modifies \"loins,\" has two meanings, which together introduce two important, conflicting, themes in the play.&nbsp; The first meaning is \"relating to fate,\" while the second is \"deadly.\"&nbsp; If we consider the first meaning, \"fatal loins\" introduces the idea that the lovers are controlled, from their very birth, by an impersonal higher power&mdash;i.e., Fate; but if we take \"fatal\" to mean \"deadly,\" then \"fatal loins\" gives us an&nbsp; oxymoron (a combination of two contradictory ideas), since it suggests that the sexual organs of Romeo''s and Juliet''s parents, which should create life by producing a baby, are deadly, that is, capable of killing.&nbsp; How can this oxymoron make sense?&nbsp; Shakespeare implies that since the two families are so concerned with killing and violence, even their act of reproduction&mdash;which should renew life&mdash;is infected by their viciousness, and instead leads to death.&nbsp; In other words, Romeo and Juliet are born to and brought up by families poisoned by the hatred of the feud they maintain, a hatred that will make it impossible for their love to exist and leads to their deaths.&nbsp; \"Fatal loins\" can thus indicate either that the children (Romeo and Juliet) have no control over their lives but are instead ruled by an impersonal fate; or, instead, that it is the fault of their families, and not of Fate, that their love is doomed, and that they die.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one expects you to spend this much time thinking about every passage in the play; but as you read, you''ll want to choose certain passages that stand out to you and attempt the same kind of analysis I''ve just performed for the sonnet.&nbsp; First, determine exactly what''s happening; and next, choose words and thoughts that strike you as intriguing, or that remind you of other parts of the play.&nbsp; As your guide, I''ll be pointing out crucial themes and images and ideas in the play.&nbsp; I''ll occasionally also direct your attention to particularly enjoyable (or raunchy, or violent, or funny) images.&nbsp; After all, this is a play about growing up during a violent feud; in other words, its main subjects are sex and violence.&nbsp; Especially in terms of sex, it can be as explicit as Hollywood has ever been.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let''s read!<br /><br />'", "deleted_on": " NULL", "id": 27, "start_index": 2},{"rating": " 0", "user_id": 3, "quote": " 'Paddock ", "section_id": 26, "end_index": 78, "created_on": " 2007-09-17 15:37:09", "published": 1, "annotation": " 'A toad.<br />'", "deleted_on": " NULL", "id": 28, "start_index": 78},{"rating": " 0", "user_id": 3, "quote": " 'Anon.

By splitting himself between an eye (fearful) and a hand (resolute) and giving the hand permission to act in darkness, Macbeth shows how he has been corrupted by the prophecy and his own ambition away from the singular good.<br /><br />Also, notice Macbeth''s use of \"that\" \"which\" and \"it\": they all refer to the murder of usurpation, but in his mind at this point they are acts with no name--what is seen can be named, but what is done in darkness cannot.<br />'", "deleted_on": " NULL", "id": 210, "start_index": 481},{"rating": " 0", "user_id": 8, "quote": " 'Thou wast the prettiest babe that e''er I nursed:   /  An I might live to see thee married once,   /  I have my wish.

Read her first line out loud (indeed, you should be reading many of these lines aloud &mdash; Shakespeare meant them to be spoken!), and marvel at the pert alliteration and crisp consonance and charming assonance.&nbsp; The sound of the language complements its sense: Juliet seems to be obeying her mother to the letter, saying she&rsquo;ll consider Paris without being improperly affectionate, only going so far as to follow her mother&rsquo;s advice in considering his offer of marriage.&nbsp; But Juliet is actually hedging&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t in fact consent to marry Paris, but instead, by adopting the guise of an extraordinarily submissive daughter, manages to avoid committing to the marriage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look to like, if looking liking move,&rdquo; which expresses a tripping delicacy in its sound, demonstrates the agility of Juliet''s mind in cleverly disobeying her mother by seeming to obey her.&nbsp; How does she disobey?&nbsp; In reponse to her mother''s question, \"can you like of Paris'' love?\", i.e., \"can you accept his love?\", she replies \"I''ll look to like\" (i.e. \"I''ll attempt to like him\") \"if looking liking move,\" i.e., \"if looking at him can make me like him.\"&nbsp; Or that''s the meaning her mother probably accepts; but Juliet uses the word \"look\" (look/looking) twice in a single line&mdash;and \"look\" has two meanings.&nbsp; The second part of her line can be read with either the literal meaning, \"to gaze at\"&mdash;or with the figurative meaning that it takes in the first part of her line, in which case Juliet''s meaning is \"I''ll try to like him, if trying to like him will make me like him.\"&nbsp; Equivocation, pure and simple, that she means her mother to misunderstand as obedience.&nbsp; Later in the play, too, when the situation is more desperate, Juliet will speak in double-meanings to her mother so that Lady Capulet thinks her daughter obeys when in fact Juliet is rejecting her mother''s authority. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Romeo, who enters the play using the borrowed language of the oxymoron, which expresses the sentiments of a love (for Rosaline) that he probably doesn''t really feel, Juliet comes onstage in full command of a subtle language all her own that allows her, at thirteen years old, to function as a private and independent young woman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contrasting portrayal of Romeo and Juliet, accomplished through the language they speak, reminds us of Shakespeare''s astonishing virtuosity as a writer&mdash;of why he''s considered the greatest poet in the English language.&nbsp; If we read his lines too quickly, Shakespeare''s characterization will escape us: all of his language seems so beautiful, so impossibly eloquent.&nbsp; But if you pay attention to the subtleties of his language&mdash;how and why each character speaks the way he or she does&mdash;you''ll realize that the beauty of Shakespeare''s words is never \"beauty for beauty''s sake\"; rather, the sheer splendor of his language is always enlisted in a carefully, rigorously organized dramatic plan&mdash;here, the contrasting characterization of the title-characters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feel free to get caught up in the sheer beauty of the language&mdash;in fact, you''re missing a lot if you don''t.&nbsp; Most of the time, when I read Shakespeare, I''m so overwhelmed by the poetry itself that I can''t concentrate on the subtleties of meaning; only on a second reading, or even a third, can I begin to escape the magnetic allure of the beautiful language.&nbsp; So to reiterate: be seduced by Shakespeare''s words; but after you''ve wallowed in their beauty, think long and hard about them.&nbsp; Once you''ve gained access to some of the deeper meanings governing the play, your admiration for Shakespeare''s language will only increase.<br /><br />'", "deleted_on": " NULL", "id": 214, "start_index": 939},{"rating": " 0", "user_id": 8, "quote": " 'Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others ", "section_id": 67, "end_index": 12, "created_on": " 2007-09-18 08:35:43", "published": 1, "annotation": " 'The dialogue among Romeo and his friends twists and turns and presents some difficulty in being understood.&nbsp;

With the duo love-sonnet that constitutes Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;s first interaction, Shakespeare ratchets up the intensity of the play&rsquo;s lyricism, enlisting a formal lyric device&mdash;that is, the sonnet&mdash;to generate the erotic charge between the lovers.&nbsp; And with the enforced parting that separates Romeo and Juliet as soon as they&rsquo;ve begun passionately to kiss, Shakespeare manipulates the audience through frustration&mdash;just as the play rises to a new level in beauty of language, in emotional temperature, in excitement, the lovers are separated.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing like frustrated desire to increase that desire.&nbsp; Note Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius as a dramatic playwright: this separation not only serves the play&rsquo;s plot by increasing Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;s mutual desire; it also increases our desire, as the audience, to see the lovers reunited.&nbsp; Shakespeare is very much aware that he&rsquo;s writing for an audience, and he takes great pains to make the experience of the audience as exciting as the experience of the characters within his play.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that said&mdash;with the temperature of the play rising, the lovers parted even as they kiss, the action pressing forward towards the famous balcony scene&mdash;Shakespeare then includes another expository sonnet that, quite frankly, is rather dull.&nbsp; One early edition (Q1) of the play doesn&rsquo;t include this sonnet; I wish it had never been included in any edition of the play, for it retards the play&rsquo;s forward surge with tedious and, worse, superfluous exposition.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does it say?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a quick prose paraphrase:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romeo&rsquo;s forgotten his old crush; when he saw Juliet, Rosaline no longer seemed beautiful.&nbsp; In fact, Juliet loves Romeo, too [remember how Rosaline didn&rsquo;t return Romeo&rsquo;s affection?].&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s a problem: their families are enemies, so it&rsquo;ll be difficult for them to meet the way most lovers can.&nbsp; With the strength of their passion, however, they&rsquo;ll find a way to see each other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this information is quite obvious to the audience or the reader.&nbsp; Beyond the literal meaning of the poetry, does the language of the sonnet encode some more profound meaning or thematic content?&nbsp; In its imagery, the sonnet simply recycles what we&rsquo;ve already seen and heard: &ldquo;Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie, / And young affection gapes to be his heir&rdquo; &mdash; Juliet has just cried, &ldquo;If he [Romeo] is marri&egrave;d, / My grave is like to be my wedding bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for organization, the sonnet is constructed as a plot-summary&mdash;and, unlike most well-written sonnets, then, it isn&rsquo;t united by an underlying theme.&nbsp; It does, however, end with a strong sentiment, couched in language somewhat more powerful than the rather pedestrian writing of lines 1-12: \"But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, / Temp''ring extremities with extreme sweet.\"&nbsp; The immense dangers to which the lovers expose themselves will be tempered&mdash;that is, qualified, or made less&mdash;by immense pleasures (let your imagination conjure up what those pleasures might be).&nbsp; The phrase \"temp''ring extremities with extreme sweet\" should catch your attention: first, it has a genuinely Shakespearean ring; second, it''s a somewhat clumsy oxymoron.&nbsp; \"Extremities\" is not the precise opposite of \"extreme sweet,\" but Shakespeare means the two to oppose one another.&nbsp; The oxymoron has infected the language of the play since its opening; beyond its use in conveying Romeo''s aping of adult mannerisms and, later, Juliet''s extreme emotion, perhaps&mdash;we should begin to think&mdash;the oxymoron has some more profound significance in the play.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let''s reconsider the definition of the oxymoron.&nbsp; The union of two opposites.&nbsp; But what, ultimately, is a heterosexual relationship?&nbsp; Just that: the union of opposites.&nbsp; In many ways, Romeo and Juliet is a play about discovering sexuality&mdash;Juliet is thirteen and arriving at full sexual development; Romeo is in his mid-to-late teens, arriving (since men mature later than women) at the same relative stage.&nbsp; Their falling in love is not merely an emotional, but also very much a sexual, awakening (we''ll be looking at this further in a few scenes); and their mutual sexual awakening also catalyzes and drives a rapid process of maturation.&nbsp; But the bottom line, for now: their relationship&mdash;the mystery of attraction between heterosexual men and women, a mystery these lovers have just discovered and begun to marvel at&mdash;is a physical oxymoron, the male and female united.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even further: Romeo and Juliet stand as more than just a pair of opposites in their sex&mdash;they come from families at war.&nbsp; Their relationship is thus also a social oxymoron&mdash;a union of two fatally opposed families.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what, you''re saying, does all this have to do with the sonnet at the beginning of act 2?&nbsp; And why am I not, you ask, letting you continue reading?&nbsp; Here''s the reason: I wanted to point out that this sonnet does, despite its seeming superfluousness (it tells us what we already know and what we''re about to see in the balcony scene) have a relation to the overarching thematic concerns of the play&mdash;its final lines provide a mixed oxymoron: the social (and physical) danger of their meeting combined with the extreme delights of that meeting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want to say that, despite that thematic connection, the sonnet still irks me.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; In addition to its superfluousness in imparting to us the plot, the sonnet also makes itself far too obvious in spelling out the theme of oxymoron.&nbsp;

S. Eliot''s poetry often&nbsp;tends to rely on paradox. On the one hand, \"what might have been\" is an abstraction; like Robert Frost, we can only speculate on the consequences of \"road not taken\", the actions that we didn''t take. On the other hand, Eliot is telling us that these alternative decisions or life-choices remain a \"perpetual possibility\" in \"the world of speculation\". How so? Well, there are several ways of looking at this idea. First, according to the parallel universe theory so popular among quantum physicists and science fiction writers, your alter-ego or double may&nbsp;be&nbsp;completing, distorting, or reinterpreting all of your actions on another plane of existence. Perhaps one of these parallel universes is a realm of \"what might have been\". (For a great literary illustration of this idea , see Jorge Luis Borges''s story \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" at <a href=\"http://courses.essex.ac.uk/lt/lt204/forking_paths.htm\">http://courses.essex.ac.uk/lt/lt204/forking_paths.htm</a>.) Secondly, the \"world of speculation\" that Eliot is&nbsp;invoking may well be the domain of literature itself, insofar as it allows us as readers to assume an infinite number of identities as we absorb the stories of others. Therefore, \"what might have been\" can refer to the unactualized potential of us as human beings that remains a \"perpetual possibility\" on the pages of great works of art. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Now, why does the unfulfilled point to the present? (\"What might have been and what has been been point to one end, which is always present.\") Perhaps because even the decisions you didn''t act on, or weren''t aware of still contribute to the complex web of cause and effect that led you to where you stand today. Think of the butterfly effect in chaos theory, according to which infinitesimal causes can have great effects with the passage of time. Note that Eliot''s emphasis on the present in this passage derives from Bergson''s idea of duration, which also highlights the importance of the present moment for the human experience of time. </p>'", "deleted_on": " NULL", "id": 492, "start_index": 45},{"rating": " 0", "user_id": 17, "quote": " 'Footfalls echo in the memory  /  Down the passage which we did not take  /  Towards the door we never opened  /  Into the rose-garden.
