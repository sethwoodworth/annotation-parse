<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Four</H2><p>Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting,encouraging, and telling her to come very often; and as theiracquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As awalking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she mightfind her. In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Herfather never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of theground sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the yearvaried; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too muchconfined. She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was notpleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon atany time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges. Butin every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her, and wasconfirmed in all her kind designs.</p><p>Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiringto be guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment toherself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, andpower of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that therewas no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not beexpected. Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's beingexactly the young friend she wanted&mdash;exactly the something which herhome required. Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question.Two such could never be granted. Two such she did not want. It wasquite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent.Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitudeand esteem. Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.</p><p>Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find outwho were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tellevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emmawas obliged to fancy what she liked&mdash;but she could never believe thatin the same situation <i>she</i> should not have discovered the truth.Harriet had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believejust what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.</p><p>Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of theschool in general, formed naturally a great part of theconversation&mdash;and but for her acquaintance with the Martins ofAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupiedher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months withthem, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describethe many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged hertalkativeness&mdash;amused by such a picture of another set of beings, andenjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so muchexultation of Mrs. Martin's having "<i>two</i> parlours, two very goodparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard'sdrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had livedfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two ofthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welchcow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, itshould be called <i>her</i> cow; and of their having a very handsomesummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all todrink tea:&mdash;a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozenpeople."</p><p>For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediatecause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelingsarose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother anddaughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when itappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and wasalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doingsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor littlefriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she werenot taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.</p><p>With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number andmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready tospeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merryevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so verygood-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day inorder to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she wasof them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had hisshepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.She was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. Shebelieved he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a veryfine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for hiswool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke wellof him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin hadtold her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it wasimpossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,whenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she <i>wanted</i> him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.</p><p>"Well done, Mrs. Martin!" thought Emma. "You know what you are about."</p><p>"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to sendMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose&mdash;the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had everseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the threeteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup withher."</p><p>"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business? He does not read?"</p><p>"Oh yes!&mdash;that is, no&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I believe he has read agood deal&mdash;but not what you would think any thing of. He reads theAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of thewindow seats&mdash;but he reads all <i>them</i> to himself. But sometimesof an evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloudout of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has readthe Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, norThe Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before Imentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever hecan."</p><p>The next question was&mdash;</p><p>"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?"</p><p>"Oh! not handsome&mdash;not at all handsome. I thought him very plain atfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every nowand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way toKingston. He has passed you very often."</p><p>"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but withouthaving any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or onfoot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. Theyeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can havenothing to do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance mightinterest me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way orother. But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in onesense, as much above my notice as in every other he is below it."</p><p>"To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him; but he knows you very well indeed&mdash;I mean by sight."</p><p>"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imaginehis age to be?"</p><p>"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference&mdash;which is very odd."</p><p>"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother isperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable asthey are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she wouldprobably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sortof young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, itmight be very desirable."</p><p>"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!"</p><p>"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who arenot born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortuneentirely to make&mdash;cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatevermoney he might come into when his father died, whatever his share ofthe family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in hisstock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he maybe rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realisedany thing yet."</p><p>"To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have noindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talksof taking a boy another year."</p><p>"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he doesmarry;&mdash;I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife&mdash;for though hissisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objectedto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for youto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularlycareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being agentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that stationby every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of peoplewho would take pleasure in degrading you."</p><p>"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit atHartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraidof what any body can do."</p><p>"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but Iwould have you so firmly established in good society, as to beindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see youpermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable tohave as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that ifyou should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish youmay not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquaintedwith the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter,without education."</p><p>"To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry anybody but what had had some education&mdash;and been very well brought up.However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's&mdash;and I amsure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall alwayshave a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, andshould be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as welleducated as me. But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it."</p><p>Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw noalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer,but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be noserious difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendlyarrangement of her own.</p><p>They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on theDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully ather, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma wasnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a fewyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eyesufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was veryneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had noother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, shethought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet'sinclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarilynoticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.</p><p>They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must notbe kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smilingface, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soonto compose.</p><p>"Only think of our happening to meet him!&mdash;How very odd! It wasquite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He didnot think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towardsRandalls most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of theForest yet. He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that hequite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we shouldhappen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected?What do you think of him? Do you think him so very plain?"</p><p>"He is very plain, undoubtedly&mdash;remarkably plain:&mdash;but that isnothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right toexpect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he couldbe so very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, Iconfess, a degree or two nearer gentility."</p><p>"To be sure," said Harriet, in a mortified voice, "he is not so genteel as real gentlemen."</p><p>"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have beenrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that youmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. AtHartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bredmen. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be incompany with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a veryinferior creature&mdash;and rather wondering at yourself for having everthought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkwardlook and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard tobe wholly unmodulated as I stood here."</p><p>"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine airand way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough.But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"</p><p>"Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with <i>him</i>. You might not see one in a hundred with <i>gentleman</i>so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the onlygentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston andMr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of <i>them</i>. Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You must see the difference."</p><p>"Oh yes!&mdash;there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."</p><p>"Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a persongrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should notbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, orawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in laterage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.Weston's time of life?"</p><p>"There is no saying, indeed," replied Harriet rather solemnly.</p><p>"But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completelygross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinkingof nothing but profit and loss."</p><p>"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad."</p><p>"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from thecircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thingelse&mdash;which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he todo with books? And I have no doubt that he <i>will</i> thrive, and be a very rich man in time&mdash;and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb <i>us</i>."</p><p>"I wonder he did not remember the book"&mdash;was all Harriet's answer,and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought mightbe safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time.Her next beginning was,</p><p>"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr.Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might bemore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in <i>him</i>,because there is so much good-humour with it&mdash;but that would not do tobe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commandingsort of manner, though it suits <i>him</i> very well; his figure, andlook, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man wereto set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary,I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Eltonas a model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not knowwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners aresofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be toplease you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?"</p><p>She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn fromMr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.</p><p>Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the youngfarmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellentmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for herto have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every bodyelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that anybody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it hadentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming toHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense ofits expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite thegentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not ofany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficientincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was knownto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of himas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without anydeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.</p><p>She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet abeautiful girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings atHartfield, was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's therecould be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him wouldhave all the usual weight and efficacy. And he was really a verypleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious mightlike. He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired ingeneral, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of featurewhich she could not dispense with:&mdash;but the girl who could be gratifiedby a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts for hermight very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.</p></body>
