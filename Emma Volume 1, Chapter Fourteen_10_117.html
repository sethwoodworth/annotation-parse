<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Fourteen</H2><p>Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as theywalked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;&mdash;Mr. Elton must compose hisjoyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Eltonmust smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for theplace.&mdash;Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just ashappy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in theworld to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not anyone, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to andunderstood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, thelittle affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her fatherand herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Westonhad not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterruptedcommunication of all those little matters on which the daily happinessof private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.</p><p>This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might notafford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; butthe very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice wasgrateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible ofMr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy allthat was enjoyable to the utmost.</p><p>The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone throughbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough togive the history of it, besides all the history of his own andIsabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed justgot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see hisdaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had beenalmost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn awayand welcome her dear Emma.</p><p>Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rathersorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was closeto her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibilitytowards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, butwas continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, andsolicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgettinghim, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internalsuggestion of "Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it bepossible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections fromHarriet to me?&mdash;Absurd and insufferable!"&mdash; Yet he would be so anxiousfor her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father,and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring herdrawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terriblylike a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve hergood manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and forHarriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was evenpositively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something wasgoing on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.Elton's nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heardenough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about hisson; she heard the words "my son," and "Frank," and "my son," repeatedseveral times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very muchsuspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; butbefore she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely pastthat any reviving question from her would have been awkward.</p><p>Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of nevermarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. FrankChurchill, which always interested her. She had frequentlythought&mdash;especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor&mdash;thatif she <i>were</i> to marry, he was the very person to suit her inage, character and condition. He seemed by this connexion between thefamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be amatch that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though notmeaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up asituation which she believed more replete with good than any she couldchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decidedintention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certaindegree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled intheir friends' imaginations.</p><p>With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfullyill-timed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, whilefeeling very cross&mdash;and of thinking that the rest of the visit couldnot possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.&mdash;So itproved;&mdash; for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr.Weston, at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the caresof hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, tosay to her,</p><p>"We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like tosee two more here,&mdash;your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and myson&mdash;and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you didnot hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we areexpecting Frank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will bewith us within a fortnight."</p><p>Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assentedto his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making theirparty quite complete.</p><p>"He has been wanting to come to us," continued Mr. Weston, "eversince September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannotcommand his own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, andwho (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good manysacrifices. But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the secondweek in January."</p><p>"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is soanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy asyourself."</p><p>"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be anotherput-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but shedoes not know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is&mdash;(butthis is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it inthe other room. There are secrets in all families, you know)&mdash;The caseis, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe inJanuary; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. Ifthey are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because itis a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, hasa particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invitethem once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comesto the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am asconfident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am ofbeing here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards theupper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been solittle used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on theireffects, as I have been long in the practice of doing."</p><p>"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,"replied Emma; "but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If youthink he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe."</p><p>"Yes&mdash;I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never beenat the place in my life.&mdash;She is an odd woman!&mdash;But I never allowmyself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe her tobe very fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fondof any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (inher way&mdash;allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting everything to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, tohim, that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would notsay it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to peoplein general; and the devil of a temper."</p><p>Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs.Weston, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing herjoy&mdash; yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be ratheralarming.&mdash; Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should bevery glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting atthe time talked of: "for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot beso sanguine as Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all endin nothing. Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly howthe matter stands?"</p><p>"Yes&mdash;it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world."</p><p>"My Emma!" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "what is the certainty ofcaprice?" Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attendingbefore&mdash;"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no meansso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his fatherthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; inshort, upon her temper. To you&mdash;to my two daughters&mdash;I may venture onthe truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-temperedwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him."</p><p>"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill," repliedIsabella: "and I am sure I never think of that poor young man withoutthe greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-temperedperson, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known anything of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that shenever had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she wouldhave made them!"</p><p>Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should thenhave heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree ofunreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she reallybelieved, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to theChurchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of whichher own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.But at present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse verysoon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long afterdinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine norconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those withwhom he was always comfortable.</p><p>While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of saying,</p><p>"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any meanscertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better."</p><p>"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraidthat some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear toimagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wishon the Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. Theyare jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel nodependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine."</p><p>"He ought to come," said Emma. "If he could stay only a couple ofdays, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's nothaving it in his power to do as much as that. A young <i>woman</i>, ifshe fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance fromthose she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young <i>man'</i>s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he likes it."</p><p>"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,before one decides upon what he can do," replied Mrs. Weston. "Oneought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct ofany one individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe,certainly must not be judged by general rules: <i>she</i> is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her."</p><p>"But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, towhom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant capricetowards <i>him</i>, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all."</p><p>"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, tounderstand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it goits own way. I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerableinfluence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to knowbeforehand <i>when</i> it will be."</p><p>Emma listened, and then coolly said, "I shall not be satisfied, unless he comes."</p><p>"He may have a great deal of influence on some points," continuedMrs. Weston, "and on others, very little: and among those, on which sheis beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this verycircumstance of his coming away from them to visit us."</p></body>
