<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Seventeen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. Theweather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to staybehind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party setoff, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poorIsabella;&mdash;which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doatedon, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocentlybusy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.</p><p>The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note fromMr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say,with Mr. Elton's best compliments, "that he was proposing to leaveHighbury the following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliancewith the pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend afew weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, fromvarious circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personalleave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should everretain a grateful sense&mdash; and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should behappy to attend to them."</p><p>Emma was most agreeably surprized.&mdash;Mr. Elton's absence just at thistime was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contrivingit, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which itwas announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken thanin a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.She had not even a share in his opening compliments.&mdash;Her name was notmentioned;&mdash; and there was so striking a change in all this, and suchan ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his gracefulacknowledgments, as she thought, at first, could not escape herfather's suspicion.</p><p>It did, however.&mdash;Her father was quite taken up with the surprize ofso sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never getsafely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language.It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter forthought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr.Woodhouse talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuadethem away with all her usual promptitude.</p><p>She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She hadreason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it wasdesirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting thebetter of her other complaint before the gentleman's return. She wentto Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo thenecessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.&mdash; She hadto destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriouslyfeeding&mdash;to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred&mdash;and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all herideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions, allher prophecies for the last six weeks.</p><p>The confession completely renewed her first shame&mdash;and the sight ofHarriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity withherself again.</p><p>Harriet bore the intelligence very well&mdash;blaming nobody&mdash; and inevery thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowlyopinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at thatmoment to her friend.</p><p>Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to theutmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching,seemed on Harriet's side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herselfas having any thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr.Elton would have been too great a distinction.&mdash; She never could havedeserved him&mdash;and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as MissWoodhouse would have thought it possible.</p><p>Her tears fell abundantly&mdash;but her grief was so truly artless, thatno dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes&mdash; and shelistened to her and tried to console her with all her heart andunderstanding&mdash;really for the time convinced that Harriet was thesuperior creature of the two&mdash;and that to resemble her would be morefor her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligencecould do.</p><p>It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-mindedand ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmedof being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the restof her life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims,was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her ownaffection in some better method than by match-making. She got her toHartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving tooccupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Eltonfrom her thoughts.</p><p>Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; andshe could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters ingeneral, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr.Elton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet'sage, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress mightbe made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return,as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine ofacquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasingthem.</p><p>Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained thenon-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness&mdash;and did,in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen;but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive againstan inclination of that sort <i>unrequited</i>, that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.</p><p>If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evidentand indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she couldnot imagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight orthe recollection of him.</p><p>Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was badfor each, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, orof effecting any material change of society. They must encounter eachother, and make the best of it.</p><p>Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions atMrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers andgreat girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that shecould have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderationor repellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the curebe found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the wayof cure, there could be no true peace for herself.</p></body>
