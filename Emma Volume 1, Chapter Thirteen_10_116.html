<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Thirteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. JohnKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morningamong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking overwhat she had done every evening with her father and sister. She hadnothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly.It was a delightful visit;&mdash;perfect, in being much too short.</p><p>In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than theirmornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take nodenial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;&mdash;even Mr. Woodhouse waspersuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division ofthe party.</p><p>How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty ifhe could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses wereactually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simplequestion on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupyEmma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages findroom for Harriet also.</p><p>Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, werethe only persons invited to meet them;&mdash;the hours were to be early, aswell as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination beingconsulted in every thing.</p><p>The evening before this great event (for it was a very great eventthat Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had beenspent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposedwith a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emmacalled on her the next day, and found her doom already signed withregard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat:Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of,and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority whichexcluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could notspeak of her loss without many tears.</p><p>Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs.Goddard's unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representinghow much Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; andleft her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of hishaving a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her verymuch. She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, whenshe was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and asthey walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid&mdash; ofwhom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going toinquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield&mdash; theywere overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit toDonwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewedall the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatchof the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for. Theyjoined company and proceeded together. Emma was just describing thenature of her friend's complaint;&mdash; "a throat very much inflamed, witha great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &amp;c. and she wassorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very badsore-throats, and had often alarmed her with them." Mr. Elton lookedall alarm on the occasion, as he exclaimed,</p><p>"A sore-throat!&mdash;I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putridinfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care ofyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.Why does not Perry see her?"</p><p>Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillisedthis excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experienceand care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness whichshe could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed andassist than not, she added soon afterwards&mdash;as if quite another subject,</p><p>"It is so cold, so very cold&mdash;and looks and feels so very much likesnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, Ishould really try not to go out to-day&mdash;and dissuade my father fromventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feelthe cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be sogreat a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to mea little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice andwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more thancommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night."</p><p>Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer tomake; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by thekind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice ofher's, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;&mdash;but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and viewsto hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very wellsatisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being "very cold,certainly very cold," and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated himfrom Randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire afterHarriet every hour of the evening.</p><p>"You do quite right," said she;&mdash;"we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston."</p><p>But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civillyoffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's onlyobjection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much promptsatisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never hadhis broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than whenhe next looked at her.</p><p>"Well," said she to herself, "this is most strange!&mdash;After I had gothim off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet illbehind!&mdash;Most strange indeed!&mdash;But there is, I believe, in many men,especially single men, such an inclination&mdash; such a passion for diningout&mdash;a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thinggives way to it&mdash;and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a mostvaluable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much inlove with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he mustdine out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can seeready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her."</p><p>Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do himthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in hismanner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice whileassuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her fairfriend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meetingher again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and hesighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance ofapprobation much in his favour.</p><p>After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began with&mdash;</p><p>"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable thanMr. Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies toplease, every feature works."</p><p>"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect," replied Emma; "but wherethere is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlooka great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, hewill have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is suchperfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value."</p><p>"Yes," said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, "he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you."</p><p>"Me!" she replied with a smile of astonishment, "are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton's object?"</p><p>"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it neveroccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now."</p><p>"Mr. Elton in love with me!&mdash;What an idea!"</p><p>"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether itis so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think yourmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had betterlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do."</p><p>"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton andI are very good friends, and nothing more;" and she walked on, amusingherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from apartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people ofhigh pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not verywell pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, andin want of counsel. He said no more.</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, thatin spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea ofshrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with hiseldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousnessof the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of hisown going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that itwas cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, wassevere; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakesof snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance ofbeing so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a verywhite world in a very short time.</p><p>Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. Thepreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice ofhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipatednothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and thewhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing hisdiscontent.</p><p>"A man," said he, "must have a very good opinion of himself when heasks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day asthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a mostagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatestabsurdity&mdash;Actually snowing at this moment!&mdash; The folly of not allowingpeople to be comfortable at home&mdash;and the folly of people's not stayingcomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such anevening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship weshould deem it;&mdash;and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothingthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance ofthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his viewor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelterthat he can;&mdash; here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours inanother man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not saidand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;&mdash;four horses andfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shiveringcreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have hadat home."</p><p>Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which nodoubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the "Very true, mylove," which must have been usually administered by his travellingcompanion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making anyanswer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded beingquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him totalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without openingher lips.</p><p>They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr.Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emmathought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was allobligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilitiesindeed, that she began to think he must have received a differentaccount of Harriet from what had reached her. She had sent whiledressing, and the answer had been, "Much the same&mdash; not better."</p><p>"<i>My</i> report from Mrs. Goddard's," said she presently, "was not so pleasant as I had hoped&mdash;`Not better' was <i>my</i> answer."</p><p>His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered.</p><p>"Oh! no&mdash;I am grieved to find&mdash;I was on the point of telling youthat when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very lastthing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was notbetter, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved andconcerned&mdash; I had flattered myself that she must be better after such acordial as I knew had been given her in the morning."</p><p>Emma smiled and answered&mdash;"My visit was of use to the nervous partof her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as youprobably heard."</p><p>"Yes&mdash;I imagined&mdash;that is&mdash;I did not&mdash;"</p><p>"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrowmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it isimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!"</p><p>"Dreadful!&mdash;Exactly so, indeed.&mdash;She will be missed every moment."</p><p>This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was reallyestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismaywhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.</p><p>"What an excellent device," said he, "the use of a sheepskin forcarriages. How very comfortable they make it;&mdash;impossible to feel coldwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed haverendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fencedand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its wayunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a verycold afternoon&mdash;but in this carriage we know nothing of thematter.&mdash;Ha! snows a little I see."</p><p>"Yes," said John Knightley, "and I think we shall have a good deal of it."</p><p>"Christmas weather," observed Mr. Elton. "Quite seasonable; andextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not beginyesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possiblyhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there beenmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quitethe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every bodyinvites their friends about them, and people think little of even theworst weather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week.Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could notget away till that very day se'nnight."</p><p>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly,</p><p>"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls."</p><p>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too muchastonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harrietseemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.</p><p>"We are sure of excellent fires," continued he, "and every thing inthe greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;&mdash; Mrs.Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values,so hospitable, and so fond of society;&mdash; it will be a small party, butwhere small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable ofany. Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than tencomfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me,(turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have yourapprobation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the largeparties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings."</p><p>"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir&mdash;I never dine with any body."</p><p>"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the lawhad been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when youwill be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and greatenjoyment."</p><p>"My first enjoyment," replied John Knightley, as they passed throughthe sweep-gate, "will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again."</p></body>
