<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Ten</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather toprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on themorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, wholived a little way out of Highbury.</p><p>Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a laneleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main streetof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode ofMr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old andnot very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It hadno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by thepresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibilityof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observingeyes.&mdash;Emma's remark was&mdash;</p><p>"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these days."&mdash; Harriet's was&mdash;</p><p>"Oh, what a sweet house!&mdash;How very beautiful!&mdash;There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much."</p><p>"I do not often walk this way <i>now</i>," said Emma, as they proceeded, "but <i>then</i>there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimatelyacquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this partof Highbury."</p><p>Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side theVicarage, and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, consideringexteriors and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof oflove, with Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.</p><p>"I wish we could contrive it," said she; "but I cannot think of anytolerable pretence for going in;&mdash;no servant that I want to inquireabout of his housekeeper&mdash;no message from my father."</p><p>She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some minutes, Harriet thus began again&mdash;</p><p>"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going to be married! so charming as you are!"&mdash;</p><p>Emma laughed, and replied,</p><p>"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me tomarry; I must find other people charming&mdash;one other person at least.And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have verylittle intention of ever marrying at all."</p><p>"Ah!&mdash;so you say; but I cannot believe it."</p><p>"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to betempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of thequestion: and I do <i>not</i> wish to see any such person. I wouldrather not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I wereto marry, I must expect to repent it."</p><p>"Dear me!&mdash;it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!"&mdash;</p><p>"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I tofall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never havebeen in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I evershall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such asituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as muchmistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never,never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so alwaysfirst and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's."</p><p>"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!"</p><p>"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; andif I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly&mdash;so satisfied&mdash;so smiling&mdash;so prosing&mdash;so undistinguishing and unfastidious&mdash; and soapt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marryto-morrow. But between <i>us</i>, I am convinced there never can be any likeness, except in being unmarried."</p><p>"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!"</p><p>"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it ispoverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! Asingle woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a singlewoman, of good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensibleand pleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so muchagainst the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sourthe temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a verysmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal andcross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only toogood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is verymuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Povertycertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she hadonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give awaysixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm."</p><p>"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you grow old?"</p><p>"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with agreat many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should bemore in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me thenas they are now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, Ishall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. Andas for objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is intruth the great point of inferiority, the want of which is really thegreat evil to be avoided in <i>not</i> marrying, I shall be very welloff, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about.There will be enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sortof sensation that declining life can need. There will be enough forevery hope and every fear; and though my attachment to none can equalthat of a parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what iswarmer and blinder. My nephews and nieces!&mdash;I shall often have a niecewith me."</p><p>"Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her a hundred times&mdash;but are you acquainted?"</p><p>"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury. By the bye, <i>that</i>is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece. Heaven forbid!at least, that I should ever bore people half so much about all theKnightleys together, as she does about Jane Fairfax. One is sick of thevery name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from her is read forty timesover; her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and ifshe does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pairof garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death."</p><p>They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics weresuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poorwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, hercounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romanticexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education haddone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, andalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. Inthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which shecame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could givecomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression ofthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,</p><p>"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling theymake every thing else appear!&mdash;I feel now as if I could think ofnothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, whocan say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?"</p><p>"Very true," said Harriet. "Poor creatures! one can think of nothing else."</p><p>"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over," saidEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which endedthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought theminto the lane again. "I do not think it will," stopping to look oncemore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the stillgreater within.</p><p>"Oh! dear, no," said her companion.</p><p>They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend waspassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emmatime only to say farther,</p><p>"Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability ingood thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that ifcompassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it hasdone all that is truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enoughto do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressingto ourselves."</p><p>Harriet could just answer, "Oh! dear, yes," before the gentlemanjoined them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, werethe first subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. Hisvisit he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley aboutwhat could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back toaccompany them.</p><p>"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this," thoughtEmma; "to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increaseof love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on thedeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else."</p><p>Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soonafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on oneside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she hadnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits ofdependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,they would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediatelystopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacingof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of thefootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she wouldfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the timeshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had thecomfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child fromthe cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, tofetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talkto and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or wouldhave been the most natural, had she been acting just then withoutdesign; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,without any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; andshe was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in aconversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking withanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might drawback a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obligedto join them.</p><p>Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interestingdetail; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that hewas only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's partyat his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stiltoncheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery, the beet-root,and all the dessert.</p><p>"This would soon have led to something better, of course," was herconsoling reflection; "any thing interests between those who love; andany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If Icould but have kept longer away!"</p><p>They now walked on together quietly, till within view of thevicarage pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harrietinto the house, made her again find something very much amiss about herboot, and fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the laceoff short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presentlyobliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to putherself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.</p><p>"Part of my lace is gone," said she, "and I do not know how I am tocontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but Ihope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave tostop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband orstring, or any thing just to keep my boot on."</p><p>Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothingcould exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into hishouse and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. Theroom they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and lookingforwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated;the door between them was open, and Emma passed into it with thehousekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner.She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fullyintended that Mr. Elton should close it. It was not closed, however, itstill remained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessantconversation, she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his ownsubject in the adjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothingbut herself. It could be protracted no longer. She was then obliged tobe finished, and make her appearance.</p><p>The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had amost favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory ofhaving schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come tothe point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had toldHarriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothingserious.</p><p>"Cautious, very cautious," thought Emma; "he advances inch by inch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure."</p><p>Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by heringenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had beenthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leadingthem forward to the great event.</p></body>
