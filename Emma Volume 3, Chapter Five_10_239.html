<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Five</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June openedupon Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change.The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of theuse to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still ather grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland wasagain delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she waslikely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least shewere able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her service, and saveherself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will.</p><p>Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, hadcertainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growingto dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing inhis pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, hismother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct,discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But while so manywere devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet,Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle withJane Fairfax. He could not understand it; but there were symptoms ofintelligence between them&mdash;he thought so at least&mdash; symptoms ofadmiration on his side, which, having once observed, he could notpersuade himself to think entirely void of meaning, however he mightwish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination. <i>She</i> was notpresent when the suspicion first arose. He was dining with the Randallsfamily, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he had seen a look, more than asingle look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of MissWoodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he was again in theircompany, he could not help remembering what he had seen; nor could heavoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and his fire attwilight,</p><p>"Myself creating what I saw,"</p><p>brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something ofprivate liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchilland Jane.</p><p>He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, tospend his evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; hejoined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who,like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as theweather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Batesand her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, onreaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort ofvisiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go inand drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately;and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few personslistened to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse'smost obliging invitation.</p><p>As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback. The gentlemen spoke of his horse.</p><p>"By the bye," said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, "what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?"</p><p>Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, "I did not know that he ever had any such plan."</p><p>"Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago."</p><p>"Me! impossible!"</p><p>"Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as whatwas certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and wasextremely happy about it. It was owing to <i>her</i> persuasion, as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You must remember it now?"</p><p>"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."</p><p>"Never! really, never!&mdash;Bless me! how could it be?&mdash;Then I must havedreamt it&mdash;but I was completely persuaded&mdash;Miss Smith, you walk as ifyou were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home."</p><p>"What is this?&mdash;What is this?" cried Mr. Weston, "about Perry and acarriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad hecan afford it. You had it from himself, had you?"</p><p>"No, sir," replied his son, laughing, "I seem to have had it fromnobody.&mdash;Very odd!&mdash;I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's havingmentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, withall these particulars&mdash;but as she declares she never heard a syllableof it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a greatdreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away&mdash; and when Ihave gone through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr.and Mrs. Perry."</p><p>"It is odd though," observed his father, "that you should have hadsuch a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likelyyou should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his carriage!and his wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health&mdash; justwhat will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a littlepremature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, yourdream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you areabsent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?"</p><p>Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests toprepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach ofMr. Weston's hint.</p><p>"Why, to own the truth," cried Miss Bates, who had been trying invain to be heard the last two minutes, "if I must speak on thissubject, there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have&mdash;I donot mean to say that he did not dream it&mdash;I am sure I have sometimesthe oddest dreams in the world&mdash;but if I am questioned about it, I mustacknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perryherself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well asourselves&mdash;but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and onlythought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he shouldhave a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morningbecause she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don't you remembergrandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we hadbeen walking to&mdash; very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was toRandalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother&mdash;indeedI do not know who is not&mdash;and she had mentioned it to her inconfidence; she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but itwas not to go beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned itto a soul that I know of. At the same time, I will not positivelyanswer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimespop out a thing before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rathera talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I shouldnot. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it <i>she</i>never betrayed the least thing in the world. Where is she?&mdash;Oh! justbehind. Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming.&mdash; Extraordinary dream,indeed!"</p><p>They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded MissBates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where hethought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he hadinvoluntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busywith her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemenwaited at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in FrankChurchill the determination of catching her eye&mdash; he seemed watchingher intently&mdash;in vain, however, if it were so&mdash; Jane passed betweenthem into the hall, and looked at neither.</p><p>There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream mustbe borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest roundthe large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,and which none but Emma could have had power to place there andpersuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, onwhich two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Teapassed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.</p><p>"Miss Woodhouse," said Frank Churchill, after examining a tablebehind him, which he could reach as he sat, "have your nephews takenaway their alphabets&mdash;their box of letters? It used to stand here.Where is it? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to betreated rather as winter than summer. We had great amusement with thoseletters one morning. I want to puzzle you again."</p><p>Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the tablewas quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so muchdisposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming wordsfor each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. Thequietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse,who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr.Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied inlamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the "poorlittle boys," or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letternear him, how beautifully Emma had written it.</p><p>Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slightglance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next toEmma, Jane opposite to them&mdash;and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see themall; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as littleapparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smilepushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, andburied from sight, she should have looked on the table instead oflooking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager afterevery fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fellto work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.The word was <i>blunder</i>; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwiseostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it couldall be, was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretionof his favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there mustbe some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemedto meet him at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle forgallantry and trick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deepergame on Frank Churchill's part.</p><p>With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with greatalarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He sawa short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly anddemure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highlyentertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper toappear to censure; for she said, "Nonsense! for shame!" He heard FrankChurchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, "I will give it toher&mdash;shall I?"&mdash;and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eagerlaughing warmth. "No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed."</p><p>It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to lovewithout feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particulardegree of sedate civility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley'sexcessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seizeevery possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was notlong before he saw it to be <i>Dixon</i>. Jane Fairfax's perceptionseemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal tothe covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters soarranged. She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herselfwatched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and sayingonly, "I did not know that proper names were allowed," pushed away theletters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged byno other word that could be offered. Her face was averted from thosewho had made the attack, and turned towards her aunt.</p><p>"Aye, very true, my dear," cried the latter, though Jane had notspoken a word&mdash;"I was just going to say the same thing. It is time forus to be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will belooking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wishyou good night."</p><p>Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt hadpreconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table;but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr.Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushedtowards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She wasafterwards looking for her shawl&mdash;Frank Churchill was looking also&mdash;itwas growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted,Mr. Knightley could not tell.</p><p>He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full ofwhat he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist hisobservations, he must&mdash;yes, he certainly must, as a friend&mdash; an anxiousfriend&mdash;give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not seeher in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. Itwas his duty.</p><p>"Pray, Emma," said he, "may I ask in what lay the great amusement,the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? Isaw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so veryentertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other."</p><p>Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him thetrue explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed,she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.</p><p>"Oh!" she cried in evident embarrassment, "it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves."</p><p>"The joke," he replied gravely, "seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill."</p><p>He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She wouldrather busy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little whilein doubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference&mdash; fruitlessinterference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemedto declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it toher, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcomeinterference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, ratherthan the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.</p><p>"My dear Emma," said he at last, with earnest kindness, "do youthink you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between thegentleman and lady we have been speaking of?"</p><p>"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.&mdash; Why do you make a doubt of it?"</p><p>"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that she admired him?"</p><p>"Never, never!" she cried with a most open eagerness&mdash;"Never, forthe twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And howcould it possibly come into your head?"</p><p>"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment betweenthem&mdash; certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to bepublic."</p><p>"Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you canvouchsafe to let your imagination wander&mdash;but it will not do&mdash; verysorry to check you in your first essay&mdash;but indeed it will not do.There is no admiration between them, I do assure you; and theappearances which have caught you, have arisen from some peculiarcircumstances&mdash;feelings rather of a totally different nature&mdash; it isimpossible exactly to explain:&mdash;there is a good deal of nonsense init&mdash;but the part which is capable of being communicated, which issense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or admiration forone another, as any two beings in the world can be. That is, I <i>presume</i> it to be so on her side, and I can <i>answer</i> for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman's indifference."</p><p>She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfactionwhich silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would haveprolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of hissuspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of acircumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meethers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too muchirritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolutefever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almostevery evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hastyleave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.</p></body>
