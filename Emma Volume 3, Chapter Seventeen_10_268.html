<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Seventeen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if thesatisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was byknowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided inwishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was withany view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either ofIsabella's sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit bothfather and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, ashe grew older&mdash; and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten yearshence&mdash;to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense,the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; andMrs. Weston&mdash; no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her;and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how toteach, should not have their powers in exercise again.</p><p>"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me," shecontinued&mdash;"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, inMadame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her ownlittle Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan."</p><p>"That is," replied Mr. Knightley, "she will indulge her even morethan she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. Itwill be the only difference."</p><p>"Poor child!" cried Emma; "at that rate, what will become of her?"</p><p>"Nothing very bad.&mdash;The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeablein infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all mybitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owingall my happiness to <i>you</i>, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them?"</p><p>Emma laughed, and replied: "But I had the assistance of all yourendeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubtwhether my own sense would have corrected me without it."</p><p>"Do you?&mdash;I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:&mdash; MissTaylor gave you principles. You must have done well. My interferencewas quite as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you tosay, what right has he to lecture me?&mdash; and I am afraid very naturalfor you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do notbelieve I did you any good. The good was all to myself, by making youan object of the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about youso much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancyingso many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteenat least."</p><p>"I am sure you were of use to me," cried Emma. "I was very ofteninfluenced rightly by you&mdash;oftener than I would own at the time. I amvery sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to bespoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for heras you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she isthirteen."</p><p>"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one ofyour saucy looks&mdash;`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa saysI may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'&mdash;something which, you knew, I didnot approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two badfeelings instead of one."</p><p>"What an amiable creature I was!&mdash;No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance."</p><p>"`Mr. Knightley.'&mdash;You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and, fromhabit, it has not so very formal a sound.&mdash;And yet it is formal. I wantyou to call me something else, but I do not know what."</p><p>"I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable fits,about ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you;but, as you made no objection, I never did it again."</p><p>"And cannot you call me `George' now?"</p><p>"Impossible!&mdash;I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.' Iwill not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, bycalling you Mr. K.&mdash;But I will promise," she added presently, laughingand blushing&mdash;"I will promise to call you once by your Christian name.I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;&mdash;in the building inwhich N. takes M. for better, for worse."</p><p>Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one importantservice which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advicewhich would have saved her from the worst of all her womanlyfollies&mdash;her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tendera subject.&mdash;She could not enter on it.&mdash; Harriet was very seldommentioned between them. This, on his side, might merely proceed fromher not being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute itto delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that theirfriendship were declining. She was aware herself, that, parting underany other circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more,and that her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almostwholly did, on Isabella's letters. He might observe that it was so. Thepain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was verylittle inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.</p><p>Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could beexpected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to beconsulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appearto find Harriet different from what she had known her before.&mdash;Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet hadnot been equal to playing with the children, it would not have escapedher. Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, byHarriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a monthat least. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, andshe was invited to remain till they could bring her back.</p><p>"John does not even mention your friend," said Mr. Knightley. "Here is his answer, if you like to see it."</p><p>It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all aliveto know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearingthat her friend was unmentioned.</p><p>"John enters like a brother into my happiness," continued Mr.Knightley, "but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him tohave, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far frommaking flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rathercool in her praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes."</p><p>"He writes like a sensible man," replied Emma, when she had read theletter. "I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers thegood fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is notwithout hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, asyou think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a differentconstruction, I should not have believed him."</p><p>"My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means&mdash;"</p><p>"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,"interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile&mdash;"much less, perhaps,than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve onthe subject."</p><p>"Emma, my dear Emma&mdash;"</p><p>"Oh!" she cried with more thorough gaiety, "if you fancy yourbrother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in thesecret, and hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much fartherfrom doing <i>you</i> justice. He will think all the happiness, allthe advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. Iwish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him at once.&mdash; His tendercompassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther."</p><p>"Ah!" he cried, "I wish your father might be half as easilyconvinced as John will be, of our having every right that equal worthcan give, to be happy together. I am amused by one part of John'sletter&mdash; did you notice it?&mdash;where he says, that my information did nottake him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation ofhearing something of the kind."</p><p>"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your havingsome thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectlyunprepared for that."</p><p>"Yes, yes&mdash;but I am amused that he should have seen so far into myfeelings. What has he been judging by?&mdash;I am not conscious of anydifference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at thistime for my marrying any more than at another.&mdash; But it was so, Isuppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with themthe other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so muchas usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, `Uncle seemsalways tired now.'"</p><p>The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and otherpersons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficientlyrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view thather gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved firstto announce it at home, and then at Randalls.&mdash; But how to break it toher father at last!&mdash;She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour ofMr. Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart wouldhave failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was tocome at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.&mdash;Shewas forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make ita more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.She must not appear to think it a misfortune.&mdash;With all the spirits shecould command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could beobtained&mdash;which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all&mdash; she and Mr.Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive theconstant addition of that person's company whom she knew he loved, nextto his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.</p><p>Poor man!&mdash;it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he triedearnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, ofhaving always said she would never marry, and assured that it would bea great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poorIsabella, and poor Miss Taylor.&mdash;But it would not do. Emma hung abouthim affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that hemust not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriagestaking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: butshe was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she wasintroducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for thebetter; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happierfor having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used tothe idea.&mdash;Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?&mdash; He would not denythat he did, she was sure.&mdash;Whom did he ever want to consult onbusiness but Mr. Knightley?&mdash;Who was so useful to him, who so ready towrite his letters, who so glad to assist him?&mdash; Who so cheerful, soattentive, so attached to him?&mdash;Would not he like to have him always onthe spot?&mdash;Yes. That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not bethere too often; he should be glad to see him every day;&mdash;but they didsee him every day as it was.&mdash;Why could not they go on as they had done?</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst wasovercome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do therest.&mdash; To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's,whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; andhe was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.&mdash;They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters ofthe strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the firstmeeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable light&mdash;first,as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one&mdash; well aware of the nearlyequal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse'smind.&mdash;It was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom hewas used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness;and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began tothink that some time or other&mdash; in another year or two, perhaps&mdash;itmight not be so very bad if the marriage did take place.</p><p>Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that shesaid to him in favour of the event.&mdash;She had been extremely surprized,never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but shesaw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple inurging him to the utmost.&mdash;She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, asto think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respectso proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in onerespect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safelyhave attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herselfbeen the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished itlong ago.&mdash;How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emmawould have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such anarrangement desirable!&mdash; The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, fora marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombeand Hartfield had been a continual impediment&mdash;less acknowledged by Mr.Weston than by herself&mdash;but even he had never been able to finish thesubject better than by saying&mdash;"Those matters will take care ofthemselves; the young people will find a way." But here there wasnothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It wasall right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth thename. It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, andwithout one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.</p><p>Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in suchreflections as these, was one of the happiest women in the world. Ifany thing could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the babywould soon have outgrown its first set of caps.</p><p>The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr.Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enoughto familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.&mdash; He saw theadvantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy ofhis wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end ofan hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.</p><p>"It is to be a secret, I conclude," said he. "These matters arealways a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Onlylet me be told when I may speak out.&mdash;I wonder whether Jane has anysuspicion."</p><p>He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on thatpoint. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldestdaughter?&mdash;he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed,of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediatelyafterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; theyhad calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soonit would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as theevening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.</p><p>In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him,and others might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommendtheir all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the JohnKnightleys; and another might predict disagreements among theirservants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objectionraised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.&mdash;There, the surprizewas not softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it,compared with his wife; he only hoped "the young lady's pride would nowbe contented;" and supposed "she had always meant to catch Knightley ifshe could;" and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringlyexclaim, "Rather he than I!"&mdash; But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposedindeed.&mdash;"Poor Knightley! poor fellow!&mdash;sad business for him.&mdash;She wasextremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand goodqualities.&mdash; How could he be so taken in?&mdash;Did not think him at all inlove&mdash; not in the least.&mdash;Poor Knightley!&mdash;There would be an end of allpleasant intercourse with him.&mdash;How happy he had been to come and dinewith them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.&mdash;Poor fellow!&mdash;No more exploring parties to Donwell made for <i>her</i>.Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on everything.&mdash;Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that shehad abused the housekeeper the other day.&mdash;Shocking plan, livingtogether. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who hadtried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the firstquarter.</p></body>
