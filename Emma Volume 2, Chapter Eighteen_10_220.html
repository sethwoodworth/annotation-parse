<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Eighteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you," said Mr. Weston.</p><p>Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.</p><p>"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume," hecontinued&mdash; "and know him to be my son, though he does not bear myname."</p><p>"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sureMr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both havegreat pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage."</p><p>"You are very obliging.&mdash;Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.&mdash;He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in aletter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing myson's hand, presumed to open it&mdash;though it was not directed to me&mdash;itwas to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. Ihardly ever get a letter."</p><p>"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.Weston&mdash; (laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.&mdash;A mostdangerous precedent indeed!&mdash;I beg you will not let your neighboursfollow your example.&mdash;Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, wemarried women must begin to exert ourselves!&mdash;Oh! Mr. Weston, I couldnot have believed it of you!"</p><p>"Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.Elton.&mdash;This letter tells us&mdash;it is a short letter&mdash;written in a hurry,merely to give us notice&mdash;it tells us that they are all coming up totown directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account&mdash;she has not been well thewhole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her&mdash; so they are all tomove southward without loss of time."</p><p>"Indeed!&mdash;from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?"</p><p>"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London. a considerable journey."</p><p>"Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther thanfrom Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to peopleof large fortune?&mdash;You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me&mdash; but twicein one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with fourhorses."</p><p>"The evil of the distance from Enscombe," said Mr. Weston, "is, that Mrs. Churchill, <i>as</i> <i>we</i> <i>understand</i>,has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together. In Frank'slast letter she complained, he said, of being too weak to get into herconservatory without having both his arm and his uncle's! This, youknow, speaks a great degree of weakness&mdash;but now she is so impatient tobe in town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.&mdash;SoFrank writes word. Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinaryconstitutions, Mrs. Elton. You must grant me that."</p><p>"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I Always take the part of myown sex. I do indeed. I give you notice&mdash;You will find me a formidableantagonist on that point. I always stand up for women&mdash; and I assureyou, if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn,you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions toavoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her&mdash;and I believe I havecaught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;an excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?"</p><p>"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other finelady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in theland for"&mdash;</p><p>Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,</p><p>"Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure you. Do not run away with such an idea."</p><p>"Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld."</p><p>Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming sowarmly. It was by no means her object to have it believed that hersister was <i>not</i> a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit inthe pretence of it;&mdash;and she was considering in what way she had bestretract, when Mr. Weston went on.</p><p>"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect&mdash;but this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, andtherefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of healthnow; but <i>that</i> indeed, by her own account, she has always been.I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faithin Mrs. Churchill's illness."</p><p>"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?&mdash;To Bath, orto Clifton?" "She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too coldfor her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She hasnow been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, andshe begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, butvery retired."</p><p>"Aye&mdash;like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retiredfrom the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all roundit! You seem shut out from every thing&mdash;in the most completeretirement.&mdash; And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spiritslike Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may nothave resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life. Ialways say a woman cannot have too many resources&mdash;and I feel verythankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent ofsociety."</p><p>"Frank was here in February for a fortnight."</p><p>"So I remember to have heard. He will find an <i>addition</i> to thesociety of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume tocall myself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of therebeing such a creature in the world."</p><p>This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,</p><p>"My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thingpossible. Not heard of you!&mdash;I believe Mrs. Weston's letters latelyhave been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton."</p><p>He had done his duty and could return to his son.</p><p>"When Frank left us," continued he, "it was quite uncertain when wemight see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It hasbeen completely unexpected. That is, <i>I</i> always had a strongpersuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something favourablewould turn up&mdash;but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were bothdreadfully desponding. `How could he contrive to come? And how could itbe supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?' and soforth&mdash;I always felt that something would happen in our favour; and soit has, you see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life,that if things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mendthe next."</p><p>"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used tosay to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when,because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all therapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, andexclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be <i>May</i> beforeHymen's saffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have beenat to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! Thecarriage&mdash;we had disappointments about the carriage;&mdash;one morning, Iremember, he came to me quite in despair."</p><p>She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on.</p><p>"You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchillis ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place thanEnscombe&mdash;in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeableprospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring&mdash; precisely theseason of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost atthe longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, andnever too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the bestof it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; therealways is in February, you know, and we could not do half that weintended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and Ido not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, thesort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day orto-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness thanhaving him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is thestate of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will bepleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generallythought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston'spartiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, mostgratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him."</p><p>"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that myopinion will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praiseof Mr. Frank Churchill.&mdash;At the same time it is fair to observe, that Iam one of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no meansimplicitly guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son,so I shall judge of him.&mdash;I am no flatterer."</p><p>Mr. Weston was musing.</p><p>"I hope," said he presently, "I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; butthere are some traits in her character which make it difficult for meto speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot beignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of thetreatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame ofit is to be laid to her. She was the instigator. Frank's mother wouldnever have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill haspride; but his pride is nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet,indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and onlymake himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arroganceand insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fairpretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barelythe daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into aChurchill she has out-Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims:but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart."</p><p>"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite ahorror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust topeople of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood whoare such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they givethemselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of themdirectly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, andencumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immenseairs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old establishedfamilies. A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have livedat West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They camefrom Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr.Weston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there issomething direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known ofthe Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; andyet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to mybrother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearestneighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been elevenyears a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him&mdash;Ibelieve, at least&mdash;I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completedthe purchase before his death."</p><p>They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston,having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walkingaway.</p><p>After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemedlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, whichnobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry ofspirits which would have made her prefer being silent.</p><p>Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with&mdash;</p><p>"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about theboys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down atfull length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concisethan her's, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I haveto recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physicthem."</p><p>"I rather hope to satisfy you both," said Emma, "for I shall do allin my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; andhappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic."</p><p>"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again."</p><p>"That is very likely. You think so, do not you?"</p><p>"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father&mdash; oreven may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagementscontinue to increase as much as they have done lately."</p><p>"Increase!"</p><p>"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a great difference in your way of life."</p><p>"Difference! No indeed I am not."</p><p>"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with companythan you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down foronly one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!&mdash; When did ithappen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing,and you mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabellabrought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or ballsat the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes inyour goings-on, is very great."</p><p>"Yes," said his brother quickly, "it is Randalls that does it all."</p><p>"Very well&mdash;and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have lessinfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, Ionly beg you to send them home."</p><p>"No," cried Mr. Knightley, "that need not be the consequence. Let them be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure."</p><p>"Upon my word," exclaimed Emma, "you amuse me! I should like to knowhow many of all my numerous engagements take place without your beingof the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisureto attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine&mdash; whathave they been? Dining once with the Coles&mdash;and having a ball talkedof, which never took place. I can understand you&mdash;(nodding at Mr. JohnKnightley)&mdash;your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friendsat once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you,(turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am evertwo hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series ofdissipation for me, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, Imust say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think theywould fare much better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from homeabout five hours where she is absent one&mdash; and who, when he is at home,is either reading to himself or settling his accounts."</p><p>Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.</p></body>
