<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Eleven</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma wascalled downstairs to Mr. Weston, who "could not stay five minutes, andwanted particularly to speak with her."&mdash; He met her at theparlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key ofhis voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,</p><p>"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?&mdash;Do, if it be possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you."</p><p>"Is she unwell?"</p><p>"No, no, not at all&mdash;only a little agitated. She would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you <i>alone</i>, and that you know&mdash;(nodding towards her father)&mdash;Humph!&mdash;Can you come?"</p><p>"Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refusewhat you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?&mdash; Is she reallynot ill?"</p><p>"Depend upon me&mdash;but ask no more questions. You will know it all in time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!"</p><p>To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.Something really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as herfriend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it withher father, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston weresoon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace forRandalls.</p><p>"Now,"&mdash;said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,&mdash; "now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened."</p><p>"No, no,"&mdash;he gravely replied.&mdash;"Don't ask me. I promised my wife toleave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do notbe impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon."</p><p>"Break it to me," cried Emma, standing still with terror.&mdash; "GoodGod!&mdash;Mr. Weston, tell me at once.&mdash;Something has happened in BrunswickSquare. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment whatit is."</p><p>"No, indeed you are mistaken."&mdash;</p><p>"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.&mdash;Consider how many of my dearestfriends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?&mdash; I chargeyou by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment."</p><p>"Upon my word, Emma."&mdash;</p><p>"Your word!&mdash;why not your honour!&mdash;why not say upon your honour,that it has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!&mdash;What can beto be <i>broke</i> to me, that does not relate to one of that family?"</p><p>"Upon my honour," said he very seriously, "it does not. It is not inthe smallest degree connected with any human being of the name ofKnightley."</p><p>Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.</p><p>"I was wrong," he continued, "in talking of its being <i>broke</i>to you. I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does notconcern you&mdash; it concerns only myself,&mdash;that is, we hope.&mdash;Humph!&mdash;Inshort, my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. Idon't say that it is not a disagreeable business&mdash;but things might bemuch worse.&mdash;If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls."</p><p>Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort.She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being somemoney concern&mdash;something just come to light, of a disagreeable naturein the circumstances of the family,&mdash;something which the late event atRichmond had brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozennatural children, perhaps&mdash;and poor Frank cut off!&mdash; This, though veryundesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired littlemore than an animating curiosity.</p><p>"Who is that gentleman on horseback?" said she, as they proceeded&mdash;speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with anyother view.</p><p>"I do not know.&mdash;One of the Otways.&mdash;Not Frank;&mdash;it is not Frank, Iassure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by thistime."</p><p>"Has your son been with you, then?"</p><p>"Oh! yes&mdash;did not you know?&mdash;Well, well, never mind."</p><p>For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded and demure,</p><p>"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did."</p><p>They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.&mdash;"Well, my dear,"said he, as they entered the room&mdash;"I have brought her, and now I hopeyou will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use indelay. I shall not be far off, if you want me."&mdash; And Emma distinctlyheard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,&mdash;"I havebeen as good as my word. She has not the least idea."</p><p>Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so muchperturbation, that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment theywere alone, she eagerly said,</p><p>"What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, Ifind, has occurred;&mdash;do let me know directly what it is. I have beenwalking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Donot let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of yourdistress, whatever it may be."</p><p>"Have you indeed no idea?" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice."Cannot you, my dear Emma&mdash;cannot you form a guess as to what you areto hear?"</p><p>"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess."</p><p>"You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell youdirectly;" (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against lookingup.) "He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinaryerrand. It is impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak tohis father on a subject,&mdash;to announce an attachment&mdash;"</p><p>She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of Harriet.</p><p>"More than an attachment, indeed," resumed Mrs. Weston; "anengagement&mdash; a positive engagement.&mdash;What will you say, Emma&mdash;what willany body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfaxare engaged;&mdash;nay, that they have been long engaged!"</p><p>Emma even jumped with surprize;&mdash;and, horror-struck, exclaimed,</p><p>"Jane Fairfax!&mdash;Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?"</p><p>"You may well be amazed," returned Mrs. Weston, still averting hereyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time torecover&mdash; "You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been asolemn engagement between them ever since October&mdash;formed at Weymouth,and kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it butthemselves&mdash;neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.&mdash; It is sowonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yetalmost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.&mdash; I thought Iknew him."</p><p>Emma scarcely heard what was said.&mdash;Her mind was divided between twoideas&mdash;her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; andpoor Harriet;&mdash;and for some time she could only exclaim, and requireconfirmation, repeated confirmation.</p><p>"Well," said she at last, trying to recover herself; "this is acircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can atall comprehend it. What!&mdash;engaged to her all the winter&mdash; before eitherof them came to Highbury?"</p><p>"Engaged since October,&mdash;secretly engaged.&mdash;It has hurt me, Emma, very much. It has hurt his father equally. <i>Some</i> <i>part</i> of his conduct we cannot excuse."</p><p>Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, "I will not pretend <i>not</i>to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, beassured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as youare apprehensive of."</p><p>Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as steady as her words.</p><p>"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of mypresent perfect indifference," she continued, "I will farther tell you,that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when Idid like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him&mdash;nay,was attached&mdash;and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,for at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You maybelieve me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth."</p><p>Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could findutterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more goodthan any thing else in the world could do.</p><p>"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself," said she."On this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that youmight be attached to each other&mdash;and we were persuaded that it wasso.&mdash; Imagine what we have been feeling on your account."</p><p>"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit <i>him</i>,Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. Whatright had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged, andwith manners so <i>very</i> disengaged? What right had he to endeavourto please, as he certainly did&mdash;to distinguish any one young woman withpersevering attention, as he certainly did&mdash;while he really belonged toanother?&mdash;How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?&mdash; Howcould he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?&mdash; verywrong, very wrong indeed."</p><p>"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine&mdash;"</p><p>"And how could <i>she</i> bear such behaviour! Composure with awitness! to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to anotherwoman, before her face, and not resent it.&mdash;That is a degree ofplacidity, which I can neither comprehend nor respect."</p><p>"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said soexpressly. He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was hereonly a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did notallow the full use even of the time he could stay&mdash; but that there hadbeen misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed,seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might verypossibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct."</p><p>"Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston&mdash;it is too calm a censure. Much, muchbeyond impropriety!&mdash;It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk himin my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!&mdash; None of that uprightintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdainof trick and littleness, which a man should display in everytransaction of his life."</p><p>"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has beenwrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for hishaving many, very many, good qualities; and&mdash;"</p><p>"Good God!" cried Emma, not attending to her.&mdash;"Mrs. Smallridge,too! Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could hemean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself&mdash; tosuffer her even to think of such a measure!"</p><p>"He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquithim. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him&mdash;orat least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.&mdash; Tillyesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. Theyburst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message&mdash; and itwas the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project of hers,which determined him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle,throw himself on his kindness, and, in short, put an end to themiserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long."</p><p>Emma began to listen better.</p><p>"I am to hear from him soon," continued Mrs. Weston. "He told me atparting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner whichseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Letus wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. Itmay make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to beunderstood. Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry tocondemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I amsatisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxiousfor its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They mustboth have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy andconcealment."</p><p>"<i>His</i> sufferings," replied Emma dryly, "do not appear to have done him much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"</p><p>"Most favourably for his nephew&mdash;gave his consent with scarcely adifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in thatfamily! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not havebeen a hope, a chance, a possibility;&mdash;but scarcely are her remains atrest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactlyopposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, whenundue influence does not survive the grave!&mdash; He gave his consent withvery little persuasion."</p><p>"Ah!" thought Emma, "he would have done as much for Harriet."</p><p>"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light thismorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, sometime&mdash;and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back tohis uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as Itell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.&mdash; He was verymuch agitated&mdash;very much, indeed&mdash;to a degree that made him appearquite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen himbefore.&mdash;In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock offinding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of&mdash;and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal."</p><p>"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on withsuch perfect secresy?&mdash;The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them knowof the engagement?"</p><p>Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.</p><p>"None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves."</p><p>"Well," said Emma, "I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled tothe idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it avery abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system ofhypocrisy and deceit,&mdash;espionage, and treachery?&mdash; To come among uswith professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league insecret to judge us all!&mdash;Here have we been, the whole winter andspring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing oftruth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have beencarrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments andwords that were never meant for both to hear.&mdash;They must take theconsequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way notperfectly agreeable!"</p><p>"I am quite easy on that head," replied Mrs. Weston. "I am very surethat I never said any thing of either to the other, which both mightnot have heard."</p><p>"You are in luck.&mdash;Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady."</p><p>"True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of MissFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; andas to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe."</p><p>At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from thewindow, evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invitedhim in; and, while he was coming round, added, "Now, dearest Emma, letme intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart atease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make thebest of it&mdash;and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in herfavour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does notfeel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstancefor him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to agirl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have alwaysgiven her credit for&mdash; and still am disposed to give her credit for, inspite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. Andhow much may be said in her situation for even that error!"</p><p>"Much, indeed!" cried Emma feelingly. "If a woman can ever beexcused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like JaneFairfax's.&mdash;Of such, one may almost say, that `the world is nottheir's, nor the world's law.'"</p><p>She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance, exclaiming,</p><p>"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! Thiswas a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise mytalent of guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you hadlost half your property, at least. And here, instead of its being amatter of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.&mdash;Icongratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect ofhaving one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in Englandfor your daughter."</p><p>A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all wasas right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spiritswas immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: heshook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on thesubject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time andpersuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His companionssuggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections;and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talkedit all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he wasbecome perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very bestthing that Frank could possibly have done.</p></body>
