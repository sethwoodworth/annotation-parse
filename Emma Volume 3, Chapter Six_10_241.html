<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Six</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortificationof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No suchimportation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores atpresent. In the daily interchange of news, they must be againrestricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings'coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and thesituation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped mighteventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that ofall her neighbours was by the approach of it.</p><p>Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a greatdeal of pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations mustall wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So shethought at first;&mdash;but a little consideration convinced her that everything need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hillthough the Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with themin the autumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. Thatthere was to be such a party had been long generally known: it had evengiven the idea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wishedto see what every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr.Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two orthree more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and itwas to be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitelysuperior to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating anddrinking, and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.</p><p>This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could notbut feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr.Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother andsister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and gotogether; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so itwas to be, if she had no objection. Now, as her objection was nothingbut her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston mustalready be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forwardagain:&mdash;it could not be done without a reproof to him, which would begiving pain to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged toconsent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal toavoid; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to thedegradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton's party! Every feelingwas offended; and the forbearance of her outward submission left aheavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on theunmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.</p><p>"I am glad you approve of what I have done," said he verycomfortably. "But I thought you would. Such schemes as these arenothing without numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A largeparty secures its own amusement. And she is a good-natured woman afterall. One could not leave her out."</p><p>Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.</p><p>It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Eltonwas growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as topigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thinginto sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be venturedon, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources wereinadequate to such an attack.</p><p>"Is not this most vexations, Knightley?" she cried.&mdash;"And suchweather for exploring!&mdash;These delays and disappointments are quiteodious. What are we to do?&mdash;The year will wear away at this rate, andnothing done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had adelightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."</p><p>"You had better explore to Donwell," replied Mr. Knightley. "Thatmay be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They areripening fast."</p><p>If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceedso, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the "Oh! I shouldlike it of all things," was not plainer in words than manner. Donwellwas famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for theinvitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have beenenough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. Shepromised him again and again to come&mdash;much oftener than he doubted&mdash;andwas extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such adistinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.</p><p>"You may depend upon me," said she. "I certainly will come. Nameyour day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?"</p><p>"I cannot name a day," said he, "till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you."</p><p>"Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.&mdash;I am LadyPatroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me."</p><p>"I hope you will bring Elton," said he: "but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations."</p><p>"Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider&mdash;you need not be afraid of delegating power to <i>me</i>.I am no young lady on her preferment. Married women, you know, may besafely authorised. It is my party. Leave it all to me. I will inviteyour guests."</p><p>"No,"&mdash;he calmly replied,&mdash;"there is but one married woman in theworld whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases toDonwell, and that one is&mdash;"</p><p>"&mdash;Mrs. Weston, I suppose," interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.</p><p>"No&mdash;Mrs. Knightley;&mdash;and till she is in being, I will manage such matters myself."</p><p>"Ah! you are an odd creature!" she cried, satisfied to have no onepreferred to herself.&mdash;"You are a humourist, and may say what you like.Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me&mdash; Jane and heraunt.&mdash;The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meetingthe Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are attached to them."</p><p>"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home."</p><p>"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:&mdash;but as you like.It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simplething. I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little basketshanging on my arm. Here,&mdash;probably this basket with pink ribbon.Nothing can be more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another.There is to be no form or parade&mdash;a sort of gipsy party. We are to walkabout your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and situnder trees;&mdash;and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to beall out of doors&mdash;a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing asnatural and simple as possible. Is not that your idea?"</p><p>"Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to havethe table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity ofgentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think isbest observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eatingstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house."</p><p>"Well&mdash;as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by thebye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?&mdash;Pray be sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, orto inspect anything&mdash;"</p><p>"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you."</p><p>"Well&mdash;but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely clever."</p><p>"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and would spurn any body's assistance."</p><p>"I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come ondonkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me&mdash;and my caro sposo walking by. Ireally must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life Iconceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever somany resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up athome;&mdash;and very long walks, you know&mdash;in summer there is dust, and inwinter there is dirt."</p><p>"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. DonwellLane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey,however, if you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wishevery thing to be as much to your taste as possible."</p><p>"That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have thewarmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.&mdash; Yes,believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me inthe whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to pleaseme."</p><p>Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join theparty; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doorsto eat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under thespecious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent atDonwell, be tempted away to his misery.</p><p>He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid himfor his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell fortwo years. "Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could govery well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the deargirls walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be dampnow, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old houseagain exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton,and any other of his neighbours.&mdash;He could not see any objection at allto his, and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning.He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them&mdash; verykind and sensible&mdash;much cleverer than dining out.&mdash;He was not fond ofdining out."</p><p>Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence.The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if,like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particularcompliment to themselves.&mdash;Emma and Harriet professed very highexpectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised toget Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation andgratitude which could have been dispensed with.&mdash; Mr. Knightley wasthen obliged to say that he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Westonengaged to lose no time in writing, and spare no arguments to inducehim to come.</p><p>In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party toBox Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell wassettled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,&mdash;the weather appearingexactly right.</p><p>Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse wassafely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake ofthis al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in theAbbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he washappily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of whathad been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and notto heat themselves.&mdash; Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there onpurpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when allthe others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener andsympathiser.</p><p>It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as shewas satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, andlook around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with moreparticular observation, more exact understanding of a house and groundswhich must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.</p><p>She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliancewith the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as sheviewed the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable,becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered&mdash; its amplegardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which theAbbey, with all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight&mdash;andits abundance of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion norextravagance had rooted up.&mdash;The house was larger than Hartfield, andtotally unlike it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling andirregular, with many comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.&mdash;Itwas just what it ought to be, and it looked what it was&mdash;and Emma feltan increasing respect for it, as the residence of a family of such truegentility, untainted in blood and understanding.&mdash;Some faults of temperJohn Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raisea blush. These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about andindulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, andcollect round the strawberry-beds.&mdash;The whole party were assembled,excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet andher basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, ortalking&mdash;strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought orspoken of.&mdash;"The best fruit in England&mdash; every body's favourite&mdash;alwayswholesome.&mdash;These the finest beds and finest sorts.&mdash;Delightful togather for one's self&mdash;the only way of really enjoying them.&mdash;Morningdecidedly the best time&mdash;never tired&mdash; every sort good&mdash;hautboyinfinitely superior&mdash;no comparison&mdash; the others hardlyeatable&mdash;hautboys very scarce&mdash;Chili preferred&mdash; white wood finestflavour of all&mdash;price of strawberries in London&mdash; abundance aboutBristol&mdash;Maple Grove&mdash;cultivation&mdash;beds when to be renewed&mdash;gardenersthinking exactly different&mdash;no general rule&mdash; gardeners never to be putout of their way&mdash;delicious fruit&mdash; only too rich to be eaten muchof&mdash;inferior to cherries&mdash; currants more refreshing&mdash;only objection togathering strawberries the stooping&mdash;glaring sun&mdash;tired to death&mdash;couldbear it no longer&mdash; must go and sit in the shade."</p><p>Such, for half an hour, was the conversation&mdash;interrupted only onceby Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law,to inquire if he were come&mdash;and she was a little uneasy.&mdash; She had somefears of his horse.</p><p>Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged tooverhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.&mdash; Asituation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton hadreceived notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was notwith Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity andsplendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs.Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks,every thing&mdash;and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed withimmediately.&mdash;On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph&mdash;and shepositively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfaxcontinued to assure her that she would not at present engage in anything, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urgebefore.&mdash; Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write anacquiescence by the morrow's post.&mdash;How Jane could bear it at all, wasastonishing to Emma.&mdash;She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly&mdash;andat last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed aremoval.&mdash; "Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them thegardens&mdash; all the gardens?&mdash;She wished to see the whole extent."&mdash;Thepertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.</p><p>It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in ascattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensiblyfollowed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue oflimes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from theriver, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.&mdash; It led to nothing;nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars,which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of anapproach to the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however,as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself acharming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.&mdash;Theconsiderable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood,gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half amile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, wellclothed with wood;&mdash; and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placedand sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and theriver making a close and handsome curve around it.</p><p>It was a sweet view&mdash;sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, withoutbeing oppressive.</p><p>In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; andtowards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harrietdistinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley andHarriet!&mdash;It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.&mdash;Therehad been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, andturned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasantconversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have beensorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm;but now she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all itsappendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreadingflocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.&mdash;Shejoined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than inlooking around. He was giving Harriet information as to modes ofagriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, "Theseare my own concerns. I have a right to talk on such subjects, withoutbeing suspected of introducing Robert Martin."&mdash;She did not suspecthim. It was too old a story.&mdash;Robert Martin had probably ceased tothink of Harriet.&mdash;They took a few turns together along the walk.&mdash;Theshade was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part ofthe day.</p><p>The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;&mdash; andthey were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come.Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not ownhimself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured ofwishing that he would part with his black mare. He had expressedhimself as to coming, with more than common certainty. "His aunt was somuch better, that he had not a doubt of getting over to them."&mdash;Mrs.Churchill's state, however, as many were ready to remind her, wasliable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in themost reasonable dependence&mdash;and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded tobelieve, or to say, that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchillthat he was prevented coming.&mdash; Emma looked at Harriet while the pointwas under consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.</p><p>The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more tosee what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps getas far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or,at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing coolagain.&mdash;Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in thehighest part of the gardens, where no damps from the river wereimagined even by him, stirred no more; and his daughter resolved toremain with him, that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by herhusband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need.</p><p>Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse'sentertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had beenprepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and thekindness had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedinglywell amused. Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now hewould shew them all to Emma;&mdash;fortunate in having no other resemblanceto a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he wasslow, constant, and methodical.&mdash;Before this second looking over wasbegun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a fewmoments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of thehouse&mdash;and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quicklyin from the garden, and with a look of escape.&mdash; Little expecting tomeet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but MissWoodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.</p><p>"Will you be so kind," said she, "when I am missed, as to say that Iam gone home?&mdash;I am going this moment.&mdash;My aunt is not aware how lateit is, nor how long we have been absent&mdash;but I am sure we shall bewanted, and I am determined to go directly.&mdash;I have said nothing aboutit to any body. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some aregone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in Ishall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness tosay that I am gone?"</p><p>"Certainly, if you wish it;&mdash;but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone?"</p><p>"Yes&mdash;what should hurt me?&mdash;I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty minutes."</p><p>"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let myfather's servant go with you.&mdash;Let me order the carriage. It can beround in five minutes."</p><p>"Thank you, thank you&mdash;but on no account.&mdash;I would rather walk.&mdash; And for <i>me</i> to be afraid of walking alone!&mdash;I, who may so soon have to guard others!"</p><p>She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,"That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I mustorder the carriage. The heat even would be danger.&mdash;You are fatiguedalready."</p><p>"I am,"&mdash;she answered&mdash;"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort offatigue&mdash;quick walking will refresh me.&mdash;Miss Woodhouse, we all know attimes what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, areexhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let mehave my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary."</p><p>Emma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and enteringinto her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, andwatched her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look wasgrateful&mdash;and her parting words, "Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort ofbeing sometimes alone!"&mdash;seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, andto describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,even towards some of those who loved her best.</p><p>"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!" said Emma, as she turned backinto the hall again. "I do pity you. And the more sensibility youbetray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you."</p><p>Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had onlyaccomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when FrankChurchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she hadforgotten to think of him&mdash;but she was very glad to see him. Mrs.Weston would be at ease. The black mare was blameless; <i>they</i>were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had beendetained by a temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure,which had lasted some hours&mdash;and he had quite given up every thought ofcoming, till very late;&mdash;and had he known how hot a ride he shouldhave, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed heshould not have come at all. The heat was excessive; he had neversuffered any thing like it&mdash;almost wished he had staid at home&mdash;nothingkilled him like heat&mdash;he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heatwas intolerable&mdash;and he sat down, at the greatest possible distancefrom the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking verydeplorable.</p><p>"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still," said Emma.</p><p>"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill bespared&mdash;but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all begoing soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met <i>one</i> as I came&mdash;Madness in such weather!&mdash;absolute madness!"</p><p>Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill'sstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out ofhumour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might behis constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were oftenthe cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking somerefreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in thedining-room&mdash;and she humanely pointed out the door.</p><p>"No&mdash;he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make himhotter." In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; andmuttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned allher attention to her father, saying in secret&mdash;</p><p>"I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like aman who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet easytemper will not mind it."</p><p>He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, andcame back all the better&mdash;grown quite cool&mdash;and, with good manners,like himself&mdash;able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest intheir employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be solate. He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improvethem; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. Theywere looking over views in Swisserland.</p><p>"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad," said he. "I shallnever be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have mysketches, some time or other, to look at&mdash;or my tour to read&mdash;or mypoem. I shall do something to expose myself."</p><p>"That may be&mdash;but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never goto Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leaveEngland."</p><p>"They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed forher. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. Iassure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that Ishall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. Iwant a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetratingeyes may fancy&mdash;I am sick of England&mdash; and would leave it to-morrow, ifI could."</p><p>"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"</p><p>"<i>I</i> sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken.I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I amthwarted in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all afortunate person."</p><p>"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Goand eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Anotherslice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make younearly on a par with the rest of us."</p><p>"No&mdash;I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure."</p><p>"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;&mdash;you will join us. It is notSwisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in wantof a change. You will stay, and go with us?"</p><p>"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening."</p><p>"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning."</p><p>"No&mdash;It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross."</p><p>"Then pray stay at Richmond."</p><p>"But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you all there without me."</p><p>"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more."</p><p>The rest of the party were now returning, and all were sooncollected. With some there was great joy at the sight of FrankChurchill; others took it very composedly; but there was a very generaldistress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance beingexplained. That it was time for every body to go, concluded thesubject; and with a short final arrangement for the next day's scheme,they parted. Frank Churchill's little inclination to exclude himselfincreased so much, that his last words to Emma were,</p><p>"Well;&mdash;if <i>you</i> wish me to stay and join the party, I will."</p><p>She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.</p></body>
