<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Four</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are ininteresting situations, that a young person, who either marries ordies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.</p><p>A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentionedin Highbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to haveevery recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant,highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himselfarrived to triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame ofher merits, there was very little more for him to do, than to tell herChristian name, and say whose music she principally played.</p><p>Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected andmortified&mdash;disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of whatappeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the rightlady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. Hehad gone away deeply offended&mdash;he came back engaged to another&mdash;and toanother as superior, of course, to the first, as under suchcircumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came backgay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for MissWoodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.</p><p>The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usualadvantages of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of anindependent fortune, of so many thousands as would always be calledten; a point of some dignity, as well as some convenience: the storytold well; he had not thrown himself away&mdash;he had gained a woman of10,000 l. or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightfulrapidity&mdash; the first hour of introduction had been so very soonfollowed by distinguishing notice; the history which he had to giveMrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious&mdash;thesteps so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr.Green's, and the party at Mrs. Brown's&mdash;smiles and blushes rising inimportance&mdash; with consciousness and agitation richly scattered&mdash;thelady had been so easily impressed&mdash;so sweetly disposed&mdash;had in short,to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him, thatvanity and prudence were equally contented.</p><p>He had caught both substance and shadow&mdash;both fortune and affection,and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself andhis own concerns&mdash;expecting to be congratulated&mdash;ready to be laughedat&mdash;and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the youngladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been morecautiously gallant.</p><p>The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselvesto please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; andwhen he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, whicha certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that whenhe next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.</p><p>During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but justenough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her theimpression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique andpretension, now spread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning verymuch to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and hissight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeablefeelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, asource of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have beenthankful to be assured of never seeing him again. She wished him verywell; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off wouldadminister most satisfaction.</p><p>The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, mustcertainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would beprevented&mdash; many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A <i>Mrs.</i> <i>Elton</i>would be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy mightsink without remark. It would be almost beginning their life ofcivility again.</p><p>Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was goodenough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury&mdash;handsome enough&mdash;to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As toconnexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all hisown vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On thatarticle, truth seemed attainable. <i>What</i> she was, must be uncertain; but <i>who</i>she was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it didnot appear that she was at all Harriet's superior. She brought no name,no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the twodaughters of a Bristol&mdash; merchant, of course, he must be called; but,as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so verymoderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of tradehad been very moderate also. Part of every winter she had been used tospend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; forthough the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncleremained&mdash; in the law line&mdash;nothing more distinctly honourable washazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him thedaughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney,and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the connexion seemeddependent on the elder sister, who was <i>very</i> <i>well</i> <i>married</i>, to a gentleman in a <i>great</i> <i>way</i>, near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins.</p><p>Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She hadtalked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked outof it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet'smind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; hecertainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martinwould have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cureher. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be alwaysin love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from thisreappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of himsomewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three timesevery day Harriet was sure <i>just</i> to meet with him, or <i>just</i> to miss him, <i>just</i> to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, <i>just</i>to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all thefavouring warmth of surprize and conjecture. She was, moreover,perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting when at Hartfield, shewas always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothingso interesting as the discussion of his concerns; and every report,therefore, every guess&mdash;all that had already occurred, all that mightoccur in the arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income,servants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Herregard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and herregrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions ofMiss Hawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much heseemed attached!&mdash; his air as he walked by the house&mdash;the very sittingof his hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!</p><p>Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to herfriend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind,Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Eltonpredominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally usefulas a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure ofthe agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by theknowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by ElizabethMartin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet hadnot been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her,written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with agreat deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she hadbeen much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be donein return, and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr.Elton, in person, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, theMartins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off forBath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.</p><p>How that visit was to be acknowledged&mdash;what would be necessary&mdash; andwhat might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, wouldbe ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of theacquaintance!&mdash;</p><p>After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, thanHarriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they hadunderstanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formalacquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at theAbbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again sosoon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerousrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degreeof intimacy was chosen for the future.</p><p>She could think of nothing better: and though there was something init which her own heart could not approve&mdash;something of ingratitude,merely glossed over&mdash;it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?</p></body>
