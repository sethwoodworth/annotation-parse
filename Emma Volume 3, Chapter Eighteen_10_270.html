<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Eighteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from Londonwould be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking ofit one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieveher, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by.After the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a gravertone, began with,</p><p>"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news."</p><p>"Good or bad?" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.</p><p>"I do not know which it ought to be called."</p><p>"Oh! good I am sure.&mdash;I see it in your countenance. You are trying not to smile."</p><p>"I am afraid," said he, composing his features, "I am very much afraid, my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it."</p><p>"Indeed! but why so?&mdash;I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too."</p><p>"There is one subject," he replied, "I hope but one, on which we donot think alike." He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyesfixed on her face. "Does nothing occur to you?&mdash; Do not yourecollect?&mdash;Harriet Smith."</p><p>Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though she knew not what.</p><p>"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?" cried he. "You have, I believe, and know the whole."</p><p>"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me."</p><p>"You are prepared for the worst, I see&mdash;and very bad it is. Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."</p><p>Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared&mdash; and hereyes, in eager gaze, said, "No, this is impossible!" but her lips wereclosed.</p><p>"It is so, indeed," continued Mr. Knightley; "I have it from Robert Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago."</p><p>She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.</p><p>"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.&mdash;I wish our opinionswere the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will makeone or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, weneed not talk much on the subject."</p><p>"You mistake me, you quite mistake me," she replied, exertingherself. "It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,but I cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!&mdash;You cannot mean tosay, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot meanthat he has even proposed to her again&mdash;yet. You only mean, that heintends it."</p><p>"I mean that he has done it," answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but determined decision, "and been accepted."</p><p>"Good God!" she cried.&mdash;"Well!"&mdash;Then having recourse to herworkbasket, in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all theexquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she mustbe expressing, she added, "Well, now tell me every thing; make thisintelligible to me. How, where, when?&mdash;Let me know it all. I never wasmore surprized&mdash;but it does not make me unhappy, I assureyou.&mdash;How&mdash;how has it been possible?"</p><p>"It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three daysago, and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting tosend to John.&mdash;He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, andwas asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's. Theywere going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to beour brother and sister, Henry, John&mdash;and Miss Smith. My friend Robertcould not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremelyamused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day&mdash;whichhe did&mdash;and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found anopportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak invain.&mdash;She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he isdeserving. He came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me thismorning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, firston my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate ofthe how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longerhistory when you see her.&mdash; She will give you all the minuteparticulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.&mdash;In ourcommunications we deal only in the great.&mdash;However, I must say, thatRobert Martin's heart seemed for <i>him</i>, and to <i>me</i>, veryoverflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to thepurpose, that on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took chargeof Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smithand Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to makeMiss Smith rather uneasy."</p><p>He stopped.&mdash;Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak,she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree ofhappiness. She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Hersilence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added,</p><p>"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now makeyou unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.His situation is an evil&mdash;but you must consider it as what satisfiesyour friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better ofhim as you know him more. His good sense and good principles woulddelight you.&mdash;As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish yourfriend in better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could,which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.&mdash;You laugh at me aboutWilliam Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin."</p><p>He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly&mdash;she did&mdash;cheerfully answering,</p><p>"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think Harriet is doing extremely well. <i>Her</i> connexions may be worse than <i>his</i>.In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are. Ihave been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You cannotimagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared Iwas!&mdash;for I had reason to believe her very lately more determinedagainst him, much more, than she was before."</p><p>"You ought to know your friend best," replied Mr. Knightley; "but Ishould say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to bevery, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her."</p><p>Emma could not help laughing as she answered, "Upon my word, Ibelieve you know her quite as well as I do.&mdash;But, Mr. Knightley, areyou perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright <i>accepted</i>him. I could suppose she might in time&mdash;but can she already?&mdash; Did notyou misunderstand him?&mdash;You were both talking of other things; ofbusiness, shows of cattle, or new drills&mdash;and might not you, in theconfusion of so many subjects, mistake him?&mdash;It was not Harriet's handthat he was certain of&mdash;it was the dimensions of some famous ox."</p><p>The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley andRobert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and sostrong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed onHarriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with suchemphasis, "No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,"that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in somemeasure, premature. It could not be otherwise.</p><p>"Do you dare say this?" cried Mr. Knightley. "Do you dare to supposeme so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?&mdash;What do you deserve?"</p><p>"Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put upwith any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, directanswer. Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr.Martin and Harriet now are?"</p><p>"I am quite sure," he replied, speaking very distinctly, "that hetold me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothingdoubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof thatit must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knewof no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information ofher relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to bedone, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then,he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day."</p><p>"I am perfectly satisfied," replied Emma, with the brightest smiles, "and most sincerely wish them happy."</p><p>"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before."</p><p>"I hope so&mdash;for at that time I was a fool."</p><p>"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you allHarriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, andfor Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe asmuch in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I haveoften talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did.Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me ofpleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from allmy observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing herhappiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.&mdash; Much ofthis, I have no doubt, she may thank you for."</p><p>"Me!" cried Emma, shaking her head.&mdash;"Ah! poor Harriet!"</p><p>She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved.</p><p>Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of herfather. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in astate of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to becollected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and tillshe had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected,she could be fit for nothing rational.</p><p>Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to putthe horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; andshe had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.</p><p>The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations maybe imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospectof Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happyfor security.&mdash;What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow moreworthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superiorto her own. Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teachher humility and circumspection in future.</p><p>Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in herresolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in thevery midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of thedoleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart&mdash;such a Harriet!</p><p>Now there would be pleasure in her returning&mdash;Every thing would be apleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.</p><p>High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, wasthe reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightleywould soon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful toher to practise, might soon be over. She could now look forward togiving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition wasmost ready to welcome as a duty.</p><p>In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whetherin speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of hisbeing obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would bedisappointed.</p><p>They arrived.&mdash;Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:&mdash; buthardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received thethanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caughtthrough the blind, of two figures passing near the window.</p><p>"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax," said Mrs. Weston. "I was just goingto tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive thismorning. He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuadedto spend the day with us.&mdash;They are coming in, I hope."</p><p>In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad tosee him&mdash;but there was a degree of confusion&mdash;a number of embarrassingrecollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with aconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having allsat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle,that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she hadlong felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him withJane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joinedthe party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longera want of subject or animation&mdash; or of courage and opportunity forFrank Churchill to draw near her and say,</p><p>"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgivingmessage in one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made youless willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said."</p><p>"No, indeed," cried Emma, most happy to begin, "not in the least. Iam particularly glad to see and shake hands with you&mdash;and to give youjoy in person."</p><p>He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.</p><p>"Is not she looking well?" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane."Better than she ever used to do?&mdash;You see how my father and Mrs.Weston doat upon her."</p><p>But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named thename of Dixon.&mdash;Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in herhearing.</p><p>"I can never think of it," she cried, "without extreme shame."</p><p>"The shame," he answered, "is all mine, or ought to be. But is itpossible that you had no suspicion?&mdash;I mean of late. Early, I know, youhad none."</p><p>"I never had the smallest, I assure you."</p><p>"That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near&mdash;and I wish Ihad&mdash; it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrongthings, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me noservice.&mdash; It would have been a much better transgression had I brokenthe bond of secrecy and told you every thing."</p><p>"It is not now worth a regret," said Emma.</p><p>"I have some hope," resumed he, "of my uncle's being persuaded topay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When theCampbells are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continuethere, I trust, till we may carry her northward.&mdash;But now, I am at sucha distance from her&mdash;is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?&mdash; Till thismorning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do notyou pity me?"</p><p>Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay thought, he cried,</p><p>"Ah! by the bye," then sinking his voice, and looking demure for themoment&mdash;"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?" He paused.&mdash;She coloured andlaughed.&mdash;"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wishin your favour. Let me return your congratulations.&mdash; I assure you thatI have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.&mdash;Heis a man whom I cannot presume to praise."</p><p>Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his ownJane, and his next words were,</p><p>"Did you ever see such a skin?&mdash;such smoothness! such delicacy!&mdash;and yet without being actually fair.&mdash;One cannot call her fair. It is amost uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair&mdash; a mostdistinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.&mdash; Just colourenough for beauty."</p><p>"I have always admired her complexion," replied Emma, archly; "butdo not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being sopale?&mdash; When we first began to talk of her.&mdash;Have you quite forgotten?"</p><p>"Oh! no&mdash;what an impudent dog I was!&mdash;How could I dare&mdash;"</p><p>But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help saying,</p><p>"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,you had very great amusement in tricking us all.&mdash;I am sure you had.&mdash;I am sure it was a consolation to you."</p><p>"Oh! no, no, no&mdash;how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most miserable wretch!"</p><p>"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure itwas a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were takingus all in.&mdash;Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell youthe truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in thesame situation. I think there is a little likeness between us."</p><p>He bowed.</p><p>"If not in our dispositions," she presently added, with a look oftrue sensibility, "there is a likeness in our destiny; the destinywhich bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior toour own."</p><p>"True, true," he answered, warmly. "No, not true on your side. Youcan have no superior, but most true on mine.&mdash;She is a complete angel.Look at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn ofher throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.&mdash; Youwill be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels. They are to benew set. I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Willnot it be beautiful in her dark hair?"</p><p>"Very beautiful, indeed," replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that he gratefully burst out,</p><p>"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in suchexcellent looks!&mdash;I would not have missed this meeting for the world. Ishould certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come."</p><p>The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving anaccount of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, fromthe infant's appearing not quite well. She believed she had beenfoolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minuteof sending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr.Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.&mdash;In ten minutes, however,the child had been perfectly well again. This was her history; andparticularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended hervery much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted thatshe had not done it. "She should always send for Perry, if the childappeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment.She could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It wasa pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the childseemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have beenbetter if Perry had seen it."</p><p>Frank Churchill caught the name.</p><p>"Perry!" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch MissFairfax's eye. "My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.Perry?&mdash;Has he been here this morning?&mdash;And how does he travelnow?&mdash;Has he set up his carriage?"</p><p>Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined inthe laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too wasreally hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.</p><p>"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!" he cried. "I can never thinkof it without laughing.&mdash;She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. Isee it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her.Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her ownletter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye&mdash; that thewhole blunder is spread before her&mdash;that she can attend to nothingelse, though pretending to listen to the others?"</p><p>Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smilepartly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,low, yet steady voice,</p><p>"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!&mdash; They <i>will</i> sometimes obtrude&mdash;but how you can court them!"</p><p>He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; butEmma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leavingRandalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, shefelt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and reallyregarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been moresensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. Thehappiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in theanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.</p></body>
