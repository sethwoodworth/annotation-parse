<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Seven</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outwardcircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were infavour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiatingsafely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in goodtime. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, withthe Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every bodyhad a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amountof the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want ofspirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separatedtoo much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley tookcharge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to FrankChurchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonisebetter. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it nevermaterially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingnessto mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two wholehours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle ofseparation, between the other parties, too strong for any fineprospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.</p><p>At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen FrankChurchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing&mdash; lookedwithout seeing&mdash;admired without intelligence&mdash;listened without knowingwhat she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harrietshould be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.</p><p>When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great dealbetter, for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her hisfirst object. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, waspaid to her. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed allthat he cared for&mdash;and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to beflattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendlyencouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given inthe first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but whichnow, in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment ofmost people looking on it must have had such an appearance as noEnglish word but flirtation could very well describe. "Mr. FrankChurchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively." They werelaying themselves open to that very phrase&mdash;and to having it sent offin a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not thatEmma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity; it was ratherbecause she felt less happy than she had expected. She laughed becauseshe was disappointed; and though she liked him for his attentions, andthought them all, whether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness,extremely judicious, they were not winning back her heart. She stillintended him for her friend.</p><p>"How much I am obliged to you," said he, "for telling me to cometo-day!&mdash; If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost allthe happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again."</p><p>"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except thatyou were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend thanyou deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded tocome."</p><p>"Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me."</p><p>"It is hotter to-day."</p><p>"Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day."</p><p>"You are comfortable because you are under command."</p><p>"Your command?&mdash;Yes."</p><p>"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. Youhad, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from yourown management; but to-day you are got back again&mdash;and as I cannot bealways with you, it is best to believe your temper under your owncommand rather than mine."</p><p>"It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without amotive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be alwayswith me. You are always with me."</p><p>"Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence couldnot begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humourbefore."</p><p>"Three o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you first in February."</p><p>"Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)&mdash;nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talkingnonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people."</p><p>"I say nothing of which I am ashamed," replied he, with livelyimpudence. "I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hillhear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, andDorking on the other. I saw you first in February." And thenwhispering&mdash; "Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we doto rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They <i>shall</i> talk. Ladiesand gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,presides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinkingof?"</p><p>Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a greatdeal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr.Knightley's answer was the most distinct.</p><p>"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of?"</p><p>"Oh! no, no"&mdash;cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could&mdash;"Upon no account in the world. It is the very last thing I would standthe brunt of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you areall thinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two,perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I mightnot be afraid of knowing."</p><p>"It is a sort of thing," cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, "which <i>I</i> should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though, perhaps, as the <i>Chaperon</i> of the party&mdash; <i>I</i> never was in any circle&mdash;exploring parties&mdash;young ladies&mdash;married women&mdash;"</p><p>Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,</p><p>"Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed&mdash;quite unheardof&mdash; but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Everybody knows what is due to <i>you</i>."</p><p>"It will not do," whispered Frank to Emma; "they are most of themaffronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies andgentlemen&mdash;I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives herright of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and onlyrequires something very entertaining from each of you, in a generalway. Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased tosay, am very entertaining already,) and she only demands from each ofyou either one thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original orrepeated&mdash;or two things moderately clever&mdash; or three things very dullindeed, and she engages to laugh heartily at them all."</p><p>"Oh! very well," exclaimed Miss Bates, "then I need not be uneasy.`Three things very dull indeed.' That will just do for me, you know. Ishall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,shan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence onevery body's assent)&mdash;Do not you all think I shall?"</p><p>Emma could not resist.</p><p>"Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me&mdash;but you will be limited as to number&mdash;only three at once."</p><p>Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did notimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could notanger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.</p><p>"Ah!&mdash;well&mdash;to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself verydisagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend."</p><p>"I like your plan," cried Mr. Weston. "Agreed, agreed. I will do my best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?"</p><p>"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low," answered his son;&mdash;"but we shall be indulgent&mdash;especially to any one who leads the way."</p><p>"No, no," said Emma, "it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let mehear it."</p><p>"I doubt its being very clever myself," said Mr. Weston. "It is toomuch a matter of fact, but here it is.&mdash;What two letters of thealphabet are there, that express perfection?"</p><p>"What two letters!&mdash;express perfection! I am sure I do not know."</p><p>"Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will neverguess.&mdash;I will tell you.&mdash;M. and A.&mdash;Em-ma.&mdash;Do you understand?"</p><p>Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a veryindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at andenjoy in it&mdash;and so did Frank and Harriet.&mdash;It did not seem to touchthe rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, andMr. Knightley gravely said,</p><p>"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr.Weston has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked upevery body else. <i>Perfection</i> should not have come quite so soon."</p><p>"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused," said Mrs. Elton; "<i>I</i>really cannot attempt&mdash;I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I hadan acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at allpleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!&mdash; You knowwho I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very wellat Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out ofplace, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country insummer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who havewitty things at every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit. Ihave a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must beallowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, ifyou please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. Wehave nothing clever to say&mdash; not one of us.</p><p>"Yes, yes, pray pass <i>me</i>," added her husband, with a sort of sneering consciousness; "<i>I</i>have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse, or any otheryoung lady. An old married man&mdash; quite good for nothing. Shall we walk,Augusta?"</p><p>"With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot. Come, Jane, take my other arm."</p><p>Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off."Happy couple!" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out ofhearing:&mdash;"How well they suit one another!&mdash;Very lucky&mdash;marrying asthey did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!&mdash;Theyonly knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!&mdash;for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, orany public place, can give&mdash;it is all nothing; there can be noknowledge. It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among theirown set, just as they always are, that you can form any just judgment.Short of that, it is all guess and luck&mdash; and will generally beill-luck. How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance,and rued it all the rest of his life!"</p><p>Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own confederates, spoke now.</p><p>"Such things do occur, undoubtedly."&mdash;She was stopped by a cough. Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.</p><p>"You were speaking," said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.</p><p>"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunatecircumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannotimagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment mayarise&mdash; but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. Iwould be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolutecharacters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, anoppression for ever."</p><p>He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon afterwards said, in a lively tone,</p><p>"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that wheneverI marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turningto Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?&mdash;I am sure I should like anybody fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with asmile at his father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopther, educate her."</p><p>"And make her like myself."</p><p>"By all means, if you can."</p><p>"Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife."</p><p>"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothingelse. I shall go abroad for a couple of years&mdash;and when I return, Ishall come to you for my wife. Remember."</p><p>Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touchevery favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creaturedescribed? Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all thathe wished. He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment;who could say? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.</p><p>"Now, ma'am," said Jane to her aunt, "shall we join Mrs. Elton?"</p><p>"If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I wasready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shallsoon overtake her. There she is&mdash;no, that's somebody else. That's oneof the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.&mdash; Well, Ideclare&mdash;"</p><p>They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr.Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man'sspirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired atlast of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walkingquietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, andquite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful viewsbeneath her. The appearance of the servants looking out for them togive notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle ofcollecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton tohave <i>her</i> carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospectof the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionableenjoyments of this day of pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of somany ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.</p><p>While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side.He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,</p><p>"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: aprivilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still useit. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How couldyou be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in yourwit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?&mdash; Emma, I had notthought it possible."</p><p>Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.</p><p>"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?&mdash;Nobody could have helpedit. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me."</p><p>"I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked ofit since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it&mdash; with whatcandour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring yourforbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was forever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must beso irksome."</p><p>"Oh!" cried Emma, "I know there is not a better creature in theworld: but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous aremost unfortunately blended in her."</p><p>"They are blended," said he, "I acknowledge; and, were sheprosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of theridiculous over the good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leaveevery harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel withyou for any liberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation&mdash;but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case. She is poor;she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to oldage, must probably sink more. Her situation should secure yourcompassion. It was badly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from aninfant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was anhonour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of themoment, laugh at her, humble her&mdash;and before her niece, too&mdash;and beforeothers, many of whom (certainly <i>some</i>,) would be entirely guided by <i>your</i>treatment of her.&mdash;This is not pleasant to you, Emma&mdash;and it is veryfar from pleasant to me; but I must, I will,&mdash;I will tell you truthswhile I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithfulcounsel, and trusting that you will some time or other do me greaterjustice than you can do now."</p><p>While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it wasready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He hadmisinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and hertongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and,on entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome&mdash;thenreproaching herself for having taken no leave, making noacknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out withvoice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. Hehad turned away, and the horses were in motion. She continued to lookback, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, theywere half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. She wasvexed beyond what could have been expressed&mdash;almost beyond what shecould conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, atany circumstance in her life. She was most forcibly struck. The truthof this representation there was no denying. She felt it at her heart.How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How couldshe have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! Andhow suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, ofconcurrence, of common kindness!</p><p>Time did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but tofeel it more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was notnecessary to speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spiritsherself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tearsrunning down her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at anytrouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.</p></body>
