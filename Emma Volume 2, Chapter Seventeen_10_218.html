<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Seventeen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emmafound it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinctparties;&mdash; with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill didMrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Westonwere obliged to be almost always either talking together or silenttogether. Mrs. Elton left them no choice. If Jane repressed her for alittle time, she soon began again; and though much that passed betweenthem was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there wasno avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: Thepost-office&mdash;catching cold&mdash;fetching letters&mdash;and friendship, were longunder discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must be at leastequally unpleasant to Jane&mdash;inquiries whether she had yet heard of anysituation likely to suit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditatedactivity.</p><p>"Here is April come!" said she, "I get quite anxious about you. June will soon be here."</p><p>"But I have never fixed on June or any other month&mdash;merely looked forward to the summer in general."</p><p>"But have you really heard of nothing?"</p><p>"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet."</p><p>"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing."</p><p>"I not aware!" said Jane, shaking her head; "dear Mrs. Elton, who can have thought of it as I have done?"</p><p>"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know how many candidates there always are for the <i>first</i>situations. I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round MapleGrove. A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity ofapplications; every body was anxious to be in her family, for she movesin the first circle. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine howdesirable! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one Iwould most wish to see you in."</p><p>"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,"said Jane. "I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will wantit;&mdash;afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But Iwould not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries atpresent."</p><p>"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving metrouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly bemore interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge ina day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-outfor any thing eligible."</p><p>"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject toher; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any bodytrouble."</p><p>"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, andJune, or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplishbefore us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as youdeserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everydayoccurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, wemust begin inquiring directly."</p><p>"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make noinquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid ofbeing long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquirywould soon produce something&mdash;Offices for the sale&mdash; not quite of humanflesh&mdash;but of human intellect."</p><p>"Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a flingat the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather afriend to the abolition."</p><p>"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade," repliedJane; "governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on;but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where itlies. But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices, andthat by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meetingwith something that would do."</p><p>"Something that would do!" repeated Mrs. Elton. "Aye, <i>that</i>may suit your humble ideas of yourself;&mdash;I know what a modest creatureyou are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking upwith any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, ina family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command theelegancies of life."</p><p>"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, Ithink, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for."</p><p>"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but Ishall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will bequite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to movein the first circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you toname your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in thefamily as much as you chose;&mdash;that is&mdash;I do not know&mdash; if you knew theharp, you might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well asplay;&mdash;yes, I really believe you might, even without the harp,stipulate for what you chose;&mdash;and you must and shall be delightfully,honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have anyrest."</p><p>"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of sucha situation together," said Jane, "they are pretty sure to be equal;however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted atpresent for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I amobliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishingnothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer Ishall remain where I am, and as I am."</p><p>"And I am quite serious too, I assure you," replied Mrs. Eltongaily, "in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing myfriends to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us."</p><p>In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing tillMr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change ofobject, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,</p><p>"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!&mdash;Only think ofhis gallantry in coming away before the other men!&mdash;what a dearcreature he is;&mdash;I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all thatquaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste thanmodern ease; modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr.Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutelyjealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown.How do you like it?&mdash;Selina's choice&mdash;handsome, I think, but I do notknow whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to theidea of being over-trimmed&mdash;quite a horror of finery. I must put on afew ornaments now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know,must appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; asimple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I amquite in the minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicityof dress,&mdash;show and finery are every thing. I have some notion ofputting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do youthink it will look well?"</p><p>The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room whenMr. Weston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a latedinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been toomuch expected by the best judges, for surprize&mdash; but there was greatjoy. Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would havebeen sorry to see him before. John Knightley only was in muteastonishment.&mdash;That a man who might have spent his evening quietly athome after a day of business in London, should set off again, and walkhalf a mile to another man's house, for the sake of being in mixedcompany till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civilityand the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. Aman who had been in motion since eight o'clock in the morning, andmight now have been still, who had been long talking, and might havebeen silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have beenalone!&mdash;Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of hisown fireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush outagain into the world!&mdash;Could he by a touch of his finger have instantlytaken back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his comingwould probably prolong rather than break up the party. John Knightleylooked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said, "Icould not have believed it even of <i>him</i>."</p><p>Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation hewas exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right ofbeing principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers,was making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied theinquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of allher careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spreadabroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a familycommunication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, hehad not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body inthe room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; hehad met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.</p><p>"Read it, read it," said he, "it will give you pleasure; only a few lines&mdash;will not take you long; read it to Emma."</p><p>The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling andtalking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but veryaudible to every body.</p><p>"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do yousay to it?&mdash;I always told you he would be here again soon, did notI?&mdash;Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would notbelieve me?&mdash;In town next week, you see&mdash;at the latest, I dare say; for<i>she</i> is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is tobe done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As toher illness, all nothing of course. But it is an excellent thing tohave Frank among us again, so near as town. They will stay a good whilewhen they do come, and he will be half his time with us. This isprecisely what I wanted. Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have youfinished it? Has Emma read it all? Put it up, put it up; we will have agood talk about it some other time, but it will not do now. I shallonly just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way."</p><p>Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looksand words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she washappy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warmand open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. <i>She</i> was alittle occupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understandthe degree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.</p><p>Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, toocommunicative to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with whatshe did say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happyby a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheardalready.</p><p>It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he mightnot have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularlydelighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, tobe made happy;&mdash;from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, butshe was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would havebeen too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.Elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on thesubject with her.</p></body>
