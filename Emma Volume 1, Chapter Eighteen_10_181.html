<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Eighteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near,Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter ofexcuse. For the present, he could not be spared, to his "very greatmortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope ofcoming to Randalls at no distant period."</p><p>Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed&mdash;much more disappointed, infact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young manhad been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for everexpecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes byany proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized andsorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or threemonths later would be a much better plan; better time of year; betterweather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stayconsiderably longer with them than if he had come sooner.</p><p>These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of amore apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition ofexcuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband wasto suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.</p><p>Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really aboutMr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment atRandalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted,rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it wasdesirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, shetook care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter aswarmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturallybelong to their friendship.</p><p>She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimedquite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhapsrather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away.She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of theadvantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; thepleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire,which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections onthe Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreementwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she wastaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and makinguse of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.</p><p>"The Churchills are very likely in fault," said Mr. Knightley, coolly; "but I dare say he might come if he would."</p><p>"I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him."</p><p>"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made apoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof."</p><p>"How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature?"</p><p>"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspectingthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care verylittle for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those whohave always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more naturalthan one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who areproud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfishtoo. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would havecontrived it between September and January. A man at his age&mdash;what ishe?&mdash;three or four-and-twenty&mdash;cannot be without the means of doing asmuch as that. It is impossible."</p><p>"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always beenyour own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley,of the difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to havetempers to manage."</p><p>"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twentyshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot wantmoney&mdash;he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has somuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest hauntsin the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place orother. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he canleave the Churchills."</p><p>"Yes, sometimes he can."</p><p>"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."</p><p>"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without anintimate knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in theinterior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individualof that family may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, andwith Mrs. Churchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what hernephew can do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more thanhe can at others."</p><p>"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses,and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigourand resolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention tohis father. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but ifhe wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would sayat once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill&mdash; `Every sacrifice ofmere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to yourconvenience; but I must go and see my father immediately. I know hewould be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on thepresent occasion. I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'&mdash; If he wouldsay so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, therewould be no opposition made to his going."</p><p>"No," said Emma, laughing; "but perhaps there might be some made tohis coming back again. Such language for a young man entirelydependent, to use!&mdash;Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine itpossible. But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situationsdirectly opposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such aspeech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and areto provide for him!&mdash;Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose,and speaking as loud as he could!&mdash;How can you imagine such conductpracticable?"</p><p>"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty init. He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration&mdash;made, ofcourse, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner&mdash; would dohim more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with thepeople he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedientscan ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel thatthey could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by hisfather, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, aswell as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to hisfather; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in theirhearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act inthis sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, theirlittle minds would bend to his."</p><p>"I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; butwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think theyhave a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable asgreat ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, wereto be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill'ssituation, you would be able to say and do just what you have beenrecommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. TheChurchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you wouldhave no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once intoperfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude andregard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,as you can have, without being so equal, under particularcircumstances, to act up to it."</p><p>"Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction."</p><p>"Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try tounderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directlyopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all hislife."</p><p>"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be thefirst occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right againstthe will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by thistime, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I canallow for the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he becamerational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that wasunworthy in their authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempton their side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought,there would have been no difficulty now."</p><p>"We shall never agree about him," cried Emma; "but that is nothingextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man'sperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from someadvantages, it will secure him many others."</p><p>"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, andof leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremelyexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fineflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuadehimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world ofpreserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any rightto complain. His letters disgust me."</p><p>"Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else."</p><p>"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfya woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother'splace, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on heraccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doublyfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, hewould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether hedid or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort ofconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this toherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only inFrench, not in English. He may be very `aimable,' have very goodmanners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacytowards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about him."</p><p>"You seem determined to think ill of him."</p><p>"Me!&mdash;not at all," replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; "I donot want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge hismerits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merelypersonal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,plausible manners."</p><p>"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be atreasure at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men,well-bred and agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all thevirtues into the bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a <i>sensation</i>his coming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout theparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest&mdash; one object ofcuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speakof nobody else."</p><p>"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find himconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only achattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts."</p><p>"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the tasteof every body, and has the power as well as the wish of beinguniversally agreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, ofdrawing or music; and so on to every body, having that generalinformation on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead,or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak extremelywell on each; that is my idea of him."</p><p>"And mine," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "is, that if he turn out anything like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company&mdash;the great man&mdash; thepractised politician, who is to read every body's character, and makeevery body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; tobe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear likefools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense couldnot endure such a puppy when it came to the point."</p><p>"I will say no more about him," cried Emma, "you turn every thing toevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have nochance of agreeing till he is really here."</p><p>"Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced."</p><p>"But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My lovefor Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour."</p><p>"He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,"said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emmaimmediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend whyhe should be angry.</p><p>To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be ofa different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberalityof mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with allthe high opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge,she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust tothe merit of another.</p></body>
