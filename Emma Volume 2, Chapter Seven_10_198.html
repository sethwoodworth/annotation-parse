<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Seven</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken thefollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely tohave his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him atbreakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending toreturn to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared thanhaving his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his travellingsixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air offoppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did notaccord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or eventhe unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself todiscern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change,restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he becameliable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, andthought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, wasclear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and makingno other comment than that "all young people would have their littlewhims."</p><p>With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visithitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston wasvery ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he madehimself&mdash;how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. Heappeared to have a very open temper&mdash;certainly a very cheerful andlively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a greatdeal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fondof talking of him&mdash;said he would be the best man in the world if hewere left to himself; and though there was no being attached to theaunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to meanalways to speak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and,but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there wasnothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which herimagination had given him; the honour, if not of being really in lovewith her, of being at least very near it, and saved only by her ownindifference&mdash; (for still her resolution held of never marrying)&mdash;thehonour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their jointacquaintance.</p><p>Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which musthave some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired herextremely&mdash;thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with somuch to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge himharshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, "all young people would have theirlittle whims."</p><p>There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not soleniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishesof Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances weremade for the little excesses of such a handsome young man&mdash; one whosmiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among themnot to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles&mdash;Mr.Knightley. The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment,he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say tohimself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, "Hum! just the trifling,silly fellow I took him for." She had half a mind to resent; but aninstant's observation convinced her that it was really said only torelieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore shelet it pass.</p><p>Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. andMrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularlyopportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to makeEmma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wantedexactly the advice they gave.</p><p>This was the occurrence:&mdash;The Coles had been settled some years inHighbury, and were very good sort of people&mdash;friendly, liberal, andunpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, intrade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into thecountry, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keepinglittle company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or twohad brought them a considerable increase of means&mdash; the house in townhad yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.With their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house,their inclination for more company. They added to their house, to theirnumber of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this timewere, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family atHartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room, preparedevery body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chieflyamong the single men, had already taken place. The regular and bestfamilies Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite&mdash;neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt <i>her</i>to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father's known habitswould be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coleswere very respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that itwas not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior familieswould visit them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receiveonly from herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr.Weston.</p><p>But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so manyweeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it foundher very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received theirinvitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.Weston's accounting for it with "I suppose they will not take theliberty with you; they know you do not dine out," was not quitesufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power ofrefusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembledthere, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her,occurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have beentempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and theBateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury theday before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented herabsence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question ofhis. The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on herspirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing theomission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.</p><p>It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were atHartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though herfirst remark, on reading it, was that "of course it must be declined,"she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.</p><p>She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutelywithout inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves soproperly&mdash;there was so much real attention in the manner of it&mdash; somuch consideration for her father. "They would have solicited thehonour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screenfrom London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draughtof air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them thehonour of his company." Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; andit being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done withoutneglecting his comfort&mdash;how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates,might be depended on for bearing him company&mdash; Mr. Woodhouse was to betalked into an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on aday now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. Asfor <i>his</i> going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, thehours would be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon prettywell resigned.</p><p>"I am not fond of dinner-visiting," said he&mdash;"I never was. No moreis Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Coleshould have done it. I think it would be much better if they would comein one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us&mdash;take us intheir afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are soreasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of theevening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose anybody to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dinewith them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, totake care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather bewhat it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy." Then turning to Mrs.Weston, with a look of gentle reproach&mdash;"Ah! Miss Taylor, if you hadnot married, you would have staid at home with me."</p><p>"Well, sir," cried Mr. Weston, "as I took Miss Taylor away, it isincumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.Goddard in a moment, if you wish it."</p><p>But the idea of any thing to be done in a <i>moment</i>, wasincreasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knewbetter how to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thingdeliberately arranged.</p><p>With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough fortalking as usual. "He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had agreat regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and inviteher. James could take the note. But first of all, there must be ananswer written to Mrs. Cole."</p><p>"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You willsay that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore mustdecline their obliging invitation; beginning with my <i>compliments</i>,of course. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you whatis to be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriagewill be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. Wehave never been there above once since the new approach was made; butstill I have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And whenyou get there, you must tell him at what time you would have him comefor you again; and you had better name an early hour. You will not likestaying late. You will get very tired when tea is over."</p><p>"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?"</p><p>"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise."</p><p>"But, my dear sir," cried Mr. Weston, "if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party."</p><p>"And no great harm if it does," said Mr. Woodhouse. "The sooner every party breaks up, the better."</p><p>"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma'sgoing away directly after tea might be giving offence. They aregood-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but stillthey must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment;and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any otherperson's in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify theColes, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, andwho have been your neighbours these <i>ten</i> years."</p><p>"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged toyou for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them anypain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Colenever touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, buthe is bilious&mdash;Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the meansof giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I amsure, rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you wouldstay a little longer than you might wish. You will not regard beingtired. You will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends."</p><p>"Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should haveno scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. Iam only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your notbeing exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, youknow; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up byyourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time&mdash;and the idea ofthat would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to situp."</p><p>He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that,if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; ifhungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid shouldsit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that everything were safe in the house, as usual.</p></body>
