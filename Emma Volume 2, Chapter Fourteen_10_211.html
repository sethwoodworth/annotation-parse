<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Fourteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might beinterrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, andit must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, tosettle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, ornot pretty at all.</p><p>Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, tomake her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and shemade a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of thebusiness might be gone through as soon as possible.</p><p>She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same roomto which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, tolace up her boot, without <i>recollecting</i>. A thousand vexatiousthoughts would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; andit was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollectingtoo; but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent.The visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment andoccupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herselfentirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one,beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being "elegantly dressed, and verypleasing."</p><p>She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to findfault, but she suspected that there was no elegance;&mdash;ease, but notelegance.&mdash; She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, abride, there was too much ease. Her person was rather good; her facenot unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, wereelegant. Emma thought at least it would turn out so.</p><p>As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear&mdash;but no, she would notpermit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It wasan awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and aman had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The womanwas better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and theprivilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense todepend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had justmarried, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he hadbeen expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look aslittle wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy ascould be.</p><p>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," said Harriet, when they had quitted thehouse, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; "Well, MissWoodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?&mdash; Is not shevery charming?"</p><p>There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.</p><p>"Oh! yes&mdash;very&mdash;a very pleasing young woman."</p><p>"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful."</p><p>"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."</p><p>"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love."</p><p>"Oh! no&mdash;there is nothing to surprize one at all.&mdash;A pretty fortune; and she came in his way."</p><p>"I dare say," returned Harriet, sighing again, "I dare say she was very much attached to him."</p><p>"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry thewoman who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, andthought this the best offer she was likely to have."</p><p>"Yes," said Harriet earnestly, "and well she might, nobody couldever have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now,Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He isjust as superior as ever;&mdash;but being married, you know, it is quite adifferent thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; Ican sit and admire him now without any great misery. To know that hehas not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!&mdash; She does seem acharming young woman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! He calledher `Augusta.' How delightful!"</p><p>When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could thensee more and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be atHartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she hada quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and couldcomposedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convincedher that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied withherself, and thinking much of her own importance; that she meant toshine and be very superior, but with manners which had been formed in abad school, pert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from oneset of people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she wasignorant, and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.</p><p>Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refinedherself, she would have connected him with those who were; but MissHawkins, it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had beenthe best of her own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was thepride of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the prideof him.</p><p>The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, "Mybrother Mr. Suckling's seat;"&mdash;a comparison of Hartfield to MapleGrove. The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; andthe house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourablyimpressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she couldsee or imagine. "Very like Maple Grove indeed!&mdash;She was quite struck bythe likeness!&mdash;That room was the very shape and size of themorning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room."&mdash; Mr. Eltonwas appealed to.&mdash;"Was not it astonishingly like?&mdash; She could reallyalmost fancy herself at Maple Grove."</p><p>"And the staircase&mdash;You know, as I came in, I observed how very likethe staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. Ireally could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it isvery delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremelypartial to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there!(with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Everybody who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quitea home. Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, youwill understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at alllike what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of theevils of matrimony."</p><p>Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.</p><p>"So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house&mdash; thegrounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and standvery much in the same way&mdash;just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse ofa fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly inmind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. Peoplewho have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thingin the same style."</p><p>Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea thatpeople who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for theextensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while toattack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,</p><p>"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties."</p><p>"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you know. Surry is the garden of England."</p><p>"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Manycounties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well asSurry."</p><p>"No, I fancy not," replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile." I never heard any county but Surry called so."</p><p>Emma was silenced.</p><p>"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, orsummer at farthest," continued Mrs. Elton; "and that will be our timefor exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, Idare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holdsfour perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of <i>our</i>carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremelywell. They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that seasonof the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedlyrecommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very muchpreferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, youknow, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much aspossible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We exploredto King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully,just after their first having the barouche-landau. You have manyparties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?"</p><p>"No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the verystriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; andwe are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay athome than engage in schemes of pleasure."</p><p>"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobodycan be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it atMaple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going toBristol, `I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. Iabsolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in thebarouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with herown good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a timehas she said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. Ithink, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely fromsociety, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable tomix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either toomuch or too little. I perfectly understand your situation, however,Miss Woodhouse&mdash; (looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's stateof health must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?&mdash;Indeedhe should. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubtof its doing Mr. Woodhouse good."</p><p>"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receivingany benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown toyou, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now."</p><p>"Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, wherethe waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In myBath life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful aplace, that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse'sspirits, which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as toits recommendations to <i>you</i>, I fancy I need not take much painsto dwell on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are prettygenerally understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, whohave lived so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you someof the best society in the place. A line from me would bring you alittle host of acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge,the lady I have always resided with when in Bath, would be most happyto shew you any attentions, and would be the very person for you to gointo public with."</p><p>It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an <i>introduction</i>&mdash;ofher going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs.Elton's&mdash;probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help of aboarder, just made a shift to live!&mdash; The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, ofHartfield, was sunk indeed!</p><p>She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she couldhave given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; "but their going toBath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convincedthat the place might suit her better than her father." And then, toprevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.</p><p>"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon theseoccasions, a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury haslong known that you are a superior performer."</p><p>"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superiorperformer!&mdash;very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial aquarter your information came. I am doatingly fond ofmusic&mdash;passionately fond;&mdash;and my friends say I am not entirely devoidof taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is <i>mediocre</i>to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, playdelightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am gotinto. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of lifeto me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both atMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. Ihonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home,and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should bedisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too&mdash;knowing what I hadbeen accustomed to&mdash;of course he was not wholly without apprehension.When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that <i>the</i> <i>world</i>I could give up&mdash;parties, balls, plays&mdash;for I had no fear ofretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world wasnot necessary to <i>me</i>. I could do very well without it. To thosewho had no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made mequite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been usedto, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equalto any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomedto every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriageswere not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments.`But,' said I, `to be quite honest, I do not think I can live withoutsomething of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; butwithout music, life would be a blank to me.'"</p><p>"We cannot suppose," said Emma, smiling, "that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a <i>very</i>musical society in Highbury; and I hope you will not find he hasoutstepped the truth more than may be pardoned, in consideration of themotive."</p><p>"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted tofind myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet littleconcerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish amusical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.Will not it be a good plan? If <i>we</i> exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for <i>me</i>,as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know&mdash;there is a sad story against them, in general. They are but too apt togive up music."</p><p>"But you, who are so extremely fond of it&mdash;there can be no danger, surely?"</p><p>"I should hope not; but really when I look around among myacquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music&mdash;nevertouches the instrument&mdash;though she played sweetly. And the same may besaid of Mrs. Jeffereys&mdash;Clara Partridge, that was&mdash;and of the twoMilmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I canenumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used tobe quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that amarried woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I washalf an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper."</p><p>"But every thing of that kind," said Emma, "will soon be in so regular a train&mdash;"</p><p>"Well," said Mrs. Elton, laughing, "we shall see."</p><p>Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, hadnothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton choseanother subject.</p><p>"We have been calling at Randalls," said she, "and found them bothat home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like themextremely. Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature&mdash; quite a first-ratefavourite with me already, I assure you. And <i>she</i> appears sotruly good&mdash;there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about her,that it wins upon one directly. She was your governess, I think?"</p><p>Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.</p><p>"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman."</p><p>"Mrs. Weston's manners," said Emma, "were always particularly good.Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safestmodel for any young woman."</p><p>"And who do you think came in while we were there?"</p><p>Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance&mdash; and how could she possibly guess?</p><p>"Knightley!" continued Mrs. Elton; "Knightley himself!&mdash;Was not itlucky?&mdash;for, not being within when he called the other day, I had neverseen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s,I had a great curiosity. `My friend Knightley' had been so oftenmentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do mycaro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of hisfriend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much.Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man."</p><p>Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could breathe.</p><p>"Insufferable woman!" was her immediate exclamation. "Worse than Ihad supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!&mdash;I could not havebelieved it. Knightley!&mdash;never seen him in her life before, and callhim Knightley!&mdash;and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her <i>caro</i> <i>sposo</i>, andher resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbredfinery. Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubtwhether he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. Icould not have believed it! And to propose that she and I should uniteto form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.Weston!&mdash; Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be agentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyondmy hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would FrankChurchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted hewould be! Ah! there I am&mdash; thinking of him directly. Always the firstperson to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comesas regularly into my mind!"&mdash;</p><p>All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time herfather had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure,and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.</p><p>"Well, my dear," he deliberately began, "considering we never sawher before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare sayshe was very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. Alittle quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But Ibelieve I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks likeyou and poor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging,pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife.Though I think he had better not have married. I made the best excusesI could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on thishappy occasion; I said that I hoped I <i>should</i> in the course ofthe summer. But I ought to have gone before. Not to wait upon a brideis very remiss. Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am! But I do not likethe corner into Vicarage Lane."</p><p>"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you."</p><p>"Yes: but a young lady&mdash;a bride&mdash;I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible. It was being very deficient."</p><p>"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a <i>bride</i>? It ought to be no recommendation to <i>you</i>. It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them."</p><p>"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I wouldalways wish to pay every proper attention to a lady&mdash;and a bride,especially, is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to <i>her</i>. A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who they may."</p><p>"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not knowwhat is. And I should never have expected you to be lending yoursanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies."</p><p>"My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere commonpoliteness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with anyencouragement to people to marry."</p><p>Emma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand <i>her</i>. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long, did they occupy her.</p></body>
