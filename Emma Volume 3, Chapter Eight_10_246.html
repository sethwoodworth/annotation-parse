<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Eight</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts allthe evening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, shecould not tell. They, in their different homes, and their differentways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it wasa morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rationalsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, thanany she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with herfather, was felicity to it. <i>There</i>, indeed, lay real pleasure,for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four tohis comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of hisfond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her generalconduct, be open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped shewas not without a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, "Howcould you be so unfeeling to your father?&mdash; I must, I will tell youtruths while I can." Miss Bates should never again&mdash;no, never! Ifattention, in future, could do away the past, she might hope to beforgiven. She had been often remiss, her conscience told her so;remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact; scornful, ungracious. Butit should be so no more. In the warmth of true contrition, she wouldcall upon her the very next morning, and it should be the beginning, onher side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.</p><p>She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,that nothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, thatshe might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come inwhile she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not beashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.</p><p>"The ladies were all at home." She had never rejoiced at the soundbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or ofderiving it, except in subsequent ridicule.</p><p>There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving andtalking. She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in ahurry; the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would bepleased to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The auntand niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had adistinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door hadshut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, "Well, my dear, I shall <i>say</i> you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough."</p><p>Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on.</p><p>"I am afraid Jane is not very well," said she, "but I do not know; they <i>tell</i>me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently, MissWoodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I amvery little able&mdash;Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where you like? Iam sure she will be here presently."</p><p>Emma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment's fear of MissBates keeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came&mdash;"Very happy andobliged"&mdash;but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the samecheerful volubility as before&mdash;less ease of look and manner. A veryfriendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to areturn of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.</p><p>"Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!&mdash;I suppose you have heard&mdash;and are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed,in me&mdash;(twinkling away a tear or two)&mdash;but it will be very trying forus to part with her, after having had her so long, and she has adreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:&mdash; such longletters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon.`My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself'&mdash; for tears were in hereyes perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a greatchange; and though she is amazingly fortunate&mdash;such a situation, Isuppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out&mdash;donot think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising goodfortune&mdash;(again dispersing her tears)&mdash;but, poor dear soul! if you wereto see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know onecannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low aspossible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happyshe is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not comingto you&mdash;she is not able&mdash;she is gone into her own room&mdash; I want her tolie down upon the bed. `My dear,' said I, `I shall say you are laiddown upon the bed:' but, however, she is not; she is walking about theroom. But, now that she has written her letters, she says she shallsoon be well. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, MissWoodhouse, but your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting atthe door&mdash;I was quite ashamed&mdash; but somehow there was a littlebustle&mdash;for it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and tillyou were on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming. `It isonly Mrs. Cole,' said I, `depend upon it. Nobody else would come soearly.' `Well,' said she, `it must be borne some time or other, and itmay as well be now.' But then Patty came in, and said it was you. `Oh!'said I, `it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.'&mdash;`I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away; andthat was what made us keep you waiting&mdash;and extremely sorry and ashamedwe were. `If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must, and I will sayyou are laid down upon the bed.'"</p><p>Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growingkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings actedas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothingbut pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentlesensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might verynaturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, whenshe might not bear to see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnestregret and solicitude&mdash;sincerely wishing that the circumstances whichshe collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, mightbe as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible. "Itmust be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it was to bedelayed till Colonel Campbell's return."</p><p>"So very kind!" replied Miss Bates. "But you are always kind."</p><p>There was no bearing such an "always;" and to break through her dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of&mdash;</p><p>"Where&mdash;may I ask?&mdash;is Miss Fairfax going?"</p><p>"To a Mrs. Smallridge&mdash;charming woman&mdash;most superior&mdash;to have thecharge of her three little girls&mdash;delightful children. Impossible thatany situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except,perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but Mrs.Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very sameneighbourhood:&mdash;lives only four miles from Maple Grove. Jane will beonly four miles from Maple Grove."</p><p>"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes&mdash;"</p><p>"Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. Shewould not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, `No;' for whenJane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the verymorning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quitedecided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention;exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing tillColonel Campbell's return, and nothing should induce her to enter intoany engagement at present&mdash;and so she told Mrs. Elton over and overagain&mdash;and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change hermind!&mdash;but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, sawfarther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out insuch a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but shepositively declared she would <i>not</i> write any such denialyesterday, as Jane wished her; she would wait&mdash;and, sure enough,yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go. Quite asurprize to me! I had not the least idea!&mdash;Jane took Mrs. Elton aside,and told her at once, that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs.Smallridge's situation, she had come to the resolution of acceptingit.&mdash;I did not know a word of it till it was all settled."</p><p>"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?"</p><p>"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so,upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. `You <i>must</i> <i>all</i> spend your evening with us,' said she&mdash;`I positively must have you <i>all</i> come.'"</p><p>"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?"</p><p>"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though Ithought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not lethim off, he did not;&mdash;but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,and a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, MissWoodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemedrather fagged after the morning's party. Even pleasure, you know, isfatiguing&mdash;and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to haveenjoyed it. However, <i>I</i> shall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it."</p><p>"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been making up her mind the whole day?"</p><p>"I dare say she had."</p><p>"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all herfriends&mdash;but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that ispossible&mdash;I mean, as to the character and manners of the family."</p><p>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thingin the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings andBragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberaland elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a mostdelightful woman!&mdash;A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove&mdash;andas to the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges,there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will betreated with such regard and kindness!&mdash; It will be nothing butpleasure, a life of pleasure.&mdash;And her salary!&mdash; I really cannotventure to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used asyou are to great sums, would hardly believe that so much could be givento a young person like Jane."</p><p>"Ah! madam," cried Emma, "if other children are at all like what Iremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount ofwhat I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearlyearned."</p><p>"You are so noble in your ideas!"</p><p>"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"</p><p>"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within afortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does notknow how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, andsay, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more."</p><p>"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel andMrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself beforetheir return?"</p><p>"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such asituation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was soastonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs.Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating meupon it! It was before tea&mdash;stay&mdash;no, it could not be before tea,because we were just going to cards&mdash;and yet it was before tea, becauseI remember thinking&mdash;Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; somethinghappened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the roombefore tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. Poor oldJohn, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor fathertwenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and verypoorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints&mdash; I must go and see himto-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poorJohn's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; heis very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown,ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep hisfather without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told uswhat John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about thechaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill toRichmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Janespoke to Mrs. Elton."</p><p>Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new thiscircumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that shecould be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill'sgoing, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.</p><p>What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being theaccumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of theservants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmondsoon after the return of the party from Box Hill&mdash; which messenger,however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill hadsent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerableaccount of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay comingback beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill havingresolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horseseeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for theCrown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boygoing a good pace, and driving very steady.</p><p>There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and itcaught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject whichalready engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill'simportance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was everything, the other nothing&mdash;and she sat musing on the difference ofwoman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,till roused by Miss Bates's saying,</p><p>"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is tobecome of that?&mdash;Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it justnow.&mdash; `You must go,' said she. `You and I must part. You will have nobusiness here.&mdash;Let it stay, however,' said she; `give it houseroomtill Colonel Campbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he willsettle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'&mdash; And tothis day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his present or hisdaughter's."</p><p>Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembranceof all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so littlepleasing, that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had beenlong enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she couldventure to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.</p></body>
