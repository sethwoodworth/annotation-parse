<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Fourteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the housefrom what she had brought out!&mdash;she had then been only daring to hopefor a little respite of suffering;&mdash;she was now in an exquisite flutterof happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still begreater when the flutter should have passed away.</p><p>They sat down to tea&mdash;the same party round the same table&mdash; howoften it had been collected!&mdash;and how often had her eyes fallen on thesame shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of thewestern sun!&mdash;But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thinglike it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of herusual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentivedaughter.</p><p>Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him inthe breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and soanxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.&mdash;Could hehave seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; butwithout the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without theslightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways ofeither, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of newshe had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with muchself-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told himin return.</p><p>As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised andsubdued&mdash;and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the taxfor such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points toconsider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have somealloy. Her father&mdash;and Harriet. She could not be alone without feelingthe full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfortof both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father, itwas a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightleywould ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the mostsolemn resolution of never quitting her father.&mdash;She even wept over theidea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only anengagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the dangerof drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.&mdash;How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;&mdash; how tospare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possibleatonement; how to appear least her enemy?&mdash; On these subjects, herperplexity and distress were very great&mdash; and her mind had to passagain and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret thathad ever surrounded it.&mdash; She could only resolve at last, that shewould still avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need betold by letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have herremoved just now for a time from Highbury, and&mdash;indulging in one schememore&mdash; nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get aninvitation for her to Brunswick Square.&mdash;Isabella had been pleased withHarriet; and a few weeks spent in London must give her someamusement.&mdash; She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape beingbenefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and thechildren.&mdash; At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindnessin herself, from whom every thing was due; a separation for thepresent; an averting of the evil day, when they must all be togetheragain.</p><p>She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment whichleft her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walkingup to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and halfan hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in aproper share of the happiness of the evening before.</p><p>He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to havethe slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letterwas brought her from Randalls&mdash;a very thick letter;&mdash;she guessed whatit must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.&mdash; She wasnow in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted noexplanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself&mdash; and asfor understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable ofit.&mdash;It must be waded through, however. She opened the packet; it wastoo surely so;&mdash;a note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in theletter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.</p><p>"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to youthe enclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and havescarcely a doubt of its happy effect.&mdash;I think we shall nevermaterially disagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you bya long preface.&mdash;We are quite well.&mdash; This letter has been the cure ofall the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.&mdash;I did not quitelike your looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and thoughyou will never own being affected by weather, I think every body feelsa north-east wind.&mdash; I felt for your dear father very much in the stormof Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort ofhearing last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.</p><div class="&quot;poem&quot;"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours ever,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A.

Mycourage rises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous tobe humble. I have already met with such success in two applications forpardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,and of those among your friends who have had any ground ofoffence.&mdash;You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of mysituation when I first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me ashaving a secret which was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact.My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment, isanother question. I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to <i>think</i>it a right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windowsbelow, and casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address heropenly; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too wellknown to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail,before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright femalemind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.&mdash; Hadshe refused, I should have gone mad.&mdash;But you will be ready to say,what was your hope in doing this?&mdash;What did you look forward to?&mdash; Toany thing, every thing&mdash;to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects,sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Everypossibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings secured,in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence. If you needfarther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being yourhusband's son, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hopefor good, which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal thevalue of.&mdash;See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on myfirst visit to Randalls;&mdash;and here I am conscious of wrong, for thatvisit might have been sooner paid. You will look back and see that Idid not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as <i>you</i> werethe person slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work onmy father's compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absentedmyself from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. Mybehaviour, during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, didnot, I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. Andnow I come to the principal, the only important part of my conductwhile belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires verysolicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the warmestfriendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think Iought to add, with the deepest humiliation.&mdash; A few words which droppedfrom him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledgemyself liable to.&mdash;My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe,more than it ought.&mdash; In order to assist a concealment so essential tome, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort ofintimacy into which we were immediately thrown.&mdash;I cannot deny thatMiss Woodhouse was my ostensible object&mdash;but I am sure you will believethe declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, Iwould not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.&mdash; Amiableand delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of ayoung woman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free fromany tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as mywish.&mdash;She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumouredplayfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand eachother. From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, andwere felt to be so.&mdash;Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understandme before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;&mdash;when Icalled to take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment ofconfessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion;but I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at least in somedegree.&mdash; She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness musthave penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever thesubject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not takeher wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. I rememberher telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for herattentions to Miss Fairfax.&mdash; I hope this history of my conduct towardsher will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of whatyou saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against EmmaWoodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, andprocure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes ofthat said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherlyaffection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love asmyself.&mdash; Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,you have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was toget my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.&mdash;Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say,that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F&mdash;, who wouldnever have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.&mdash; Thedelicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, ismuch beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestlyhope, know her thoroughly yourself.&mdash; No description can describe her.She must tell you herself what she is&mdash; yet not by word, for never wasthere a human creature who would so designedly suppress her ownmerit.&mdash;Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw,I have heard from her.&mdash; She gives a good account of her own health;but as she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have youropinion of her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is livingin dread of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from youwithout delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember howfew minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state:and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness ormisery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of herexcellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and howlittle I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could butsee her again!&mdash;But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been toogood for me to encroach.&mdash;I must still add to this long letter. Youhave not heard all that you ought to hear. I could not give anyconnected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, theunseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation;for though the event of the 26th ult., as you will conclude,immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not havepresumed on such early measures, but from the very particularcircumstances, which left me not an hour to lose. I should myself haveshrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have felt every scrupleof mine with multiplied strength and refinement.&mdash; But I had no choice.The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman&mdash;Here, mydear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly, to recollect andcompose myself.&mdash;I have been walking over the country, and am now, Ihope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought tobe.&mdash;It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect for me. I behavedshamefully. And here I can admit, that my manners to Miss W., in beingunpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable. <i>She</i> disapprovedthem, which ought to have been enough.&mdash;My plea of concealing the truthshe did not think sufficient.&mdash;She was displeased; I thoughtunreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarilyscrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold. But she was alwaysright. If I had followed her judgment, and subdued my spirits to thelevel of what she deemed proper, I should have escaped the greatestunhappiness I have ever known.&mdash;We quarrelled.&mdash; Do you remember themorning spent at Donwell?&mdash;<i>There</i> every little dissatisfactionthat had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late; I met herwalking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she would notsuffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then thoughtmost unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very naturaland consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the world to ourengagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity toanother woman, was she to be consenting the next to a proposal whichmight have made every previous caution useless?&mdash;Had we been metwalking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have beensuspected.&mdash; I was mad enough, however, to resent.&mdash;I doubted heraffection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provokedby such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, andsuch apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible forany woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form ofwords perfectly intelligible to me.&mdash; In short, my dear madam, it was aquarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and I returned thesame evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till thenext morning, merely because I would be as angry with her as possible.Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled intime; but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I wentaway determined that she should make the first advances.&mdash;I shallalways congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Hadyou witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would everhave thought well of me again. Its effect upon her appears in theimmediate resolution it produced: as soon as she found I was reallygone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs.Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the bye, has everfilled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spiritof forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself; but,otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which thatwoman has known.&mdash; `Jane,' indeed!&mdash;You will observe that I have notyet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you. Think,then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltonswith all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence ofimaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.&mdash;She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, andwrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.&mdash; <i>She</i> <i>felt</i> <i>the</i> <i>engagement</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>a</i> <i>source</i> <i>of</i> <i>repentance</i> <i>and</i> <i>misery</i> <i>to</i> <i>each</i>: <i>she</i> <i>dissolved</i> <i>it</i>.&mdash;Thisletter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. Ianswered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and themultiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead ofbeing sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked upin my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, thoughbut a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.&mdash;Iwas rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily;but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and&mdash;may I add?&mdash; toocheerful in my views to be captious.&mdash;We removed to Windsor; and twodays afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters allreturned!&mdash;and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating herextreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; andadding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued, andas it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinatearrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safeconveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directlycommand hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I wouldforward them after that period to her at&mdash;: in short, the fulldirection to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. Iknew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw whatshe had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution ofcharacter which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she hadmaintained, as to any such design in her former letter, was equallydescriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would not she haveseemed to threaten me.&mdash;Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I hadactually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of thepost.&mdash; What was to be done?&mdash;One thing only.&mdash;I must speak to myuncle. Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.&mdash;I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softenedaway his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man! witha deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in themarriage state as he had done.&mdash;I felt that it would be of a differentsort.&mdash;Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered inopening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?&mdash;No;do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her.Do not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.&mdash;I reached Highbury atthe time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, Iwas certain of a good chance of finding her alone.&mdash;I was notdisappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the objectof my journey. A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure Ihad to persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, muchdearer, than ever, and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between usagain. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not concludebefore. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you haveever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart willdictate towards her.&mdash;If you think me in a way to be happier than Ideserve, I am quite of your opinion.&mdash;Miss W. calls me the child ofgood fortune. I hope she is right.&mdash;In one respect, my good fortune isundoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,</p><div class="&quot;poem&quot;"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your obliged and affectionate Son,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.</p></div></body>
