<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Seven</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a freshoccasion for Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been atHartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gonehome to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had beentalked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing somethingextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half aminute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back toMrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, andfinding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left alittle parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and onopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songswhich she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and thisletter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposalof marriage. "Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she didnot know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very goodletter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved hervery much&mdash;but she did not know&mdash;and so, she was come as fast as shecould to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.&mdash;" Emma washalf-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.</p><p>"Upon my word," she cried, "the young man is determined not to loseany thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can."</p><p>"Will you read the letter?" cried Harriet. "Pray do. I'd rather you would."</p><p>Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. Thestyle of the letter was much above her expectation. There were notmerely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not havedisgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong andunaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit ofthe writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it,while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a "Well,well," and was at last forced to add, "Is it a good letter? or is ittoo short?"</p><p>"Yes, indeed, a very good letter," replied Emma rather slowly&mdash;"sogood a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of hissisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom Isaw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, ifleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for awoman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a naturaltalent for&mdash;thinks strongly and clearly&mdash;and when he takes a pen inhand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men.Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentimentsto a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet(returning it,) than I had expected."</p><p>"Well," said the still waiting Harriet;&mdash;"well&mdash;and&mdash;and what shall I do?"</p><p>"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this letter?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course&mdash;and speedily."</p><p>"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me."</p><p>"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You willexpress yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of yournot being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must beunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude andconcern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, willpresent themselves unbidden to <i>your</i> mind, I am persuaded. You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment."</p><p>"You think I ought to refuse him then," said Harriet, looking down.</p><p>"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you inany doubt as to that? I thought&mdash;but I beg your pardon, perhaps I havebeen under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, ifyou feel in doubt as to the <i>purport</i> of your answer. I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it."</p><p>Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:</p><p>"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."</p><p>"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean&mdash;What shall I do? What wouldyou advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought todo."</p><p>"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to dowith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings."</p><p>"I had no notion that he liked me so very much," said Harriet,contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in hersilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of thatletter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,</p><p>"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman <i>doubts</i>as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought torefuse him. If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought to say `No'directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtfulfeelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, andolder than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that Iwant to influence you."</p><p>"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to&mdash;but if youwould just advise me what I had best do&mdash;No, no, I do not mean that&mdash;Asyou say, one's mind ought to be quite made up&mdash;One should not behesitating&mdash;It is a very serious thing.&mdash;It will be safer to say `No,'perhaps.&mdash;Do you think I had better say `No?'"</p><p>"Not for the world," said Emma, smiling graciously, "would I adviseyou either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. Ifyou prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the mostagreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should youhesitate? You blush, Harriet.&mdash;Does any body else occur to you at thismoment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceiveyourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At thismoment whom are you thinking of?"</p><p>The symptoms were favourable.&mdash;Instead of answering, Harriet turnedaway confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though theletter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted aboutwithout regard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not withoutstrong hopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said&mdash;</p><p>"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do aswell as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and reallyalmost made up my mind&mdash;to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?"</p><p>"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing justwhat you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings tomyself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitationin approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would havegrieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been theconsequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallestdegree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would notinfluence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I couldnot have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I amsecure of you for ever."</p><p>Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly.</p><p>"You could not have visited me!" she cried, looking aghast. "No, tobe sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That wouldhave been too dreadful!&mdash;What an escape!&mdash;Dear Miss Woodhouse, I wouldnot give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for anything in the world."</p><p>"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; butit must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all goodsociety. I must have given you up."</p><p>"Dear me!&mdash;How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!"</p><p>"Dear affectionate creature!&mdash;<i>You</i> banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!&mdash;<i>You</i>confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! Iwonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He musthave a pretty good opinion of himself."</p><p>"I do not think he is conceited either, in general," said Harriet,her conscience opposing such censure; "at least, he is very goodnatured, and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a greatregard for&mdash;but that is quite a different thing from&mdash;and you know,though he may like me, it does not follow that I should&mdash;and certainlyI must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people&mdash;and ifone comes to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparisonat all, <i>one</i> is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I doreally think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man, and have a greatopinion of him; and his being so much attached to me&mdash;and his writingsuch a letter&mdash;but as to leaving you, it is what I would not do uponany consideration."</p><p>"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not beparted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, orbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter."</p><p>"Oh no;&mdash;and it is but a short letter too."</p><p>Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a "verytrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownishmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know thather husband could write a good letter."</p><p>"Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to bealways happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refusehim. But how shall I do? What shall I say?"</p><p>Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, andadvised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope ofher assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against anyassistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of everysentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, hadsuch a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to braceher up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very muchconcerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much ofwhat his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxiousthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if theyoung man had come in her way at that moment, he would have beenaccepted after all.</p><p>This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. Thebusiness was finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all theevening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimesrelieved them by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringingforward the idea of Mr. Elton.</p><p>"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again," was said in rather a sorrowful tone.</p><p>"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared toAbbey-Mill."</p><p>"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but at Hartfield."</p><p>Some time afterwards it was, "I think Mrs. Goddard would be verymuch surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nashwould&mdash;for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it isonly a linen-draper."</p><p>"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in theteacher of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you suchan opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest wouldappear valuable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, Isuppose she is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain personcan hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancyyou and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners haveexplained themselves."</p><p>Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering thatpeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainlycheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towardsthe rejected Mr. Martin.</p><p>"Now he has got my letter," said she softly. "I wonder what they areall doing&mdash;whether his sisters know&mdash;if he is unhappy, they will beunhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much."</p><p>"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are morecheerfully employed," cried Emma. "At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Eltonis shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how muchmore beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five orsix times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name."</p><p>"My picture!&mdash;But he has left my picture in Bond-street."</p><p>"Has he so!&mdash;Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear littlemodest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-streettill just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion allthis evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to hisfamily, it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the partythose pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warmprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busytheir imaginations all are!"</p><p>Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.</p></body>
