She\\r\\ncould not think that Harriet''s solace or her own sins required more;\\r\\nand she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they\\r\\nreturned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,\\r\\nand after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter,\\r\\nand receiving no other answer than a very plaintive-- \"Mr. Elton is so\\r\\ngood to the poor!\" she found something else must be done.</p>\\r\\n<p>They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss\\r\\nBates. She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.\\r\\nThere was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss\\r\\nBates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the\\r\\nvery few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather\\r\\nnegligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to\\r\\nthe stock of their scanty comforts.</p>\\r\\n<p>She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own\\r\\nheart, as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the\\r\\npersuasion of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome\\r\\nwomen-- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the\\r\\nsecond-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for\\r\\never, and therefore she seldom went near them. But now she made the\\r\\nsudden resolution of not passing their door without going\\r\\nin--observing, as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she\\r\\ncould calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter from\\r\\nJane Fairfax.</p>\\r\\n<p>The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates\\r\\noccupied the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized\\r\\napartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most\\r\\ncordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who\\r\\nwith her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to\\r\\ngive up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking\\r\\ndaughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks\\r\\nfor their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse''s health, cheerful communications about her mother''s, and\\r\\nsweet-cake from the beaufet--\"Mrs. Cole had just been there, just\\r\\ncalled in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with\\r\\nthem, and <i>she</i> had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to\\r\\nsay she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse\\r\\nand Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr.\\r\\nElton. There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr.\\r\\nElton since his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have\\r\\nthe letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how\\r\\nmuch he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he\\r\\nwent, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies'' ball had been; and she\\r\\nwent through it very well, with all the interest and all the\\r\\ncommendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to\\r\\nprevent Harriet''s being obliged to say a word.</p>\\r\\n<p>This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but\\r\\nmeant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther\\r\\nincommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all\\r\\nthe Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had\\r\\nnot been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was\\r\\nactually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last\\r\\nabruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing-- Mrs.\\r\\nCole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- Mrs. Cole\\r\\nwas so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon\\r\\nas she came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a\\r\\nfavourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how\\r\\nto shew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as\\r\\nmuch as any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly,\\r\\nsaying, `I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is\\r\\nnot her time for writing;'' and when I immediately said, `But indeed we\\r\\nhave, we had a letter this very morning,'' I do not know that I ever saw\\r\\nany body more surprized. `Have you, upon your honour?'' said she; `well,\\r\\nthat is quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.''\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma''s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I hope she is well?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Thank you. You are so kind!\" replied the happily deceived aunt,\\r\\nwhile eagerly hunting for the letter.--\"Oh! here it is. I was sure it\\r\\ncould not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,\\r\\nwithout being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand\\r\\nso very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was\\r\\nreading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it\\r\\nagain to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her-- a letter from\\r\\nJane--that she can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not\\r\\nbe far off, and here it is, only just under my huswife--and since you\\r\\nare so kind as to wish to hear what she says;--but, first of all, I\\r\\nreally must, in justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a\\r\\nletter--only two pages you see-- hardly two--and in general she fills\\r\\nthe whole paper and crosses half. My mother often wonders that I can\\r\\nmake it out so well. She often says, when the letter is first opened,\\r\\n`Well, Hetty, now I think you will be put to it to make out all that\\r\\nchecker-work''-- don''t you, ma''am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she\\r\\nwould contrive to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for\\r\\nher-- every word of it--I am sure she would pore over it till she had\\r\\nmade out every word. And, indeed, though my mother''s eyes are not so\\r\\ngood as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God! with\\r\\nthe help of spectacles. It is such a blessing! My mother''s are really\\r\\nvery good indeed. Jane often says, when she is here, `I am sure,\\r\\ngrandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do--and so\\r\\nmuch fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last me\\r\\nas well.''\"</p>\\r\\n<p>All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for\\r\\nbreath; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\\r\\nFairfax''s handwriting.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You are extremely kind,\" replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; \"you\\r\\nwho are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure\\r\\nthere is nobody''s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse''s. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know.\\r\\nMa''am,\" addressing her, \"do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging\\r\\nto say about Jane''s handwriting?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment\\r\\nrepeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She\\r\\nwas pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming\\r\\nvery rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax''s letter, and had\\r\\nalmost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse,\\r\\nwhen Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My mother''s deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all.\\r\\nBy only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\\r\\nshe is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very\\r\\nremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\\r\\nJane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at\\r\\nall deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at\\r\\nmy mother''s time of life--and it really is full two years, you know,\\r\\nsince she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before,\\r\\nand as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough\\r\\nof her now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh yes; next week.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so\\r\\nsurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she\\r\\nwill be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see\\r\\nher. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel\\r\\nCampbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So\\r\\nvery good of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you\\r\\nknow. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about.\\r\\nThat is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in\\r\\nthe common course, we should not have heard from her before next\\r\\nTuesday or Wednesday.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not\\r\\nbeen for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so\\r\\nsoon. My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us\\r\\nat least. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have\\r\\nthe pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the\\r\\nCampbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and\\r\\nmother to come over and see her directly. They had not intended to go\\r\\nover till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again--for\\r\\ntill she married, last October, she was never away from them so much as\\r\\na week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I\\r\\nwas going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a\\r\\nvery urgent letter to her mother--or her father, I declare I do not\\r\\nknow which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane''s letter--wrote\\r\\nin Mr. Dixon''s name as well as her own, to press their coming over\\r\\ndirectly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them\\r\\nback to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.\\r\\nJane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean-- I\\r\\ndo not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was\\r\\nvery natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place\\r\\nwhile he was paying his addresses--and as Jane used to be very often\\r\\nwalking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very\\r\\nparticular about their daughter''s not walking out often with only Mr.\\r\\nDixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard every\\r\\nthing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland;\\r\\nand I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of\\r\\nthe place, views that he had taken himself. He is a most amiable,\\r\\ncharming young man, I believe. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland,\\r\\nfrom his account of things.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma''s\\r\\nbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not\\r\\ngoing to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther\\r\\ndiscovery,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed\\r\\nto come to you at such a time. Considering the very particular\\r\\nfriendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected\\r\\nher to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always\\r\\nbeen rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such\\r\\na distance from us, for months together--not able to come if any thing\\r\\nwas to happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They\\r\\nwant her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and\\r\\nMrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or\\r\\npressing than their <i>joint</i> invitation, Jane says, as you will\\r\\nhear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any\\r\\nattention. He is a most charming young man. Ever since the service he\\r\\nrendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the\\r\\nwater, and she, by the sudden whirling round of something or other\\r\\namong the sails, would have been dashed into the sea at once, and\\r\\nactually was all but gone, if he had not, with the greatest presence of\\r\\nmind, caught hold of her habit-- (I can never think of it without\\r\\ntrembling!)--But ever since we had the history of that day, I have been\\r\\nso fond of Mr. Dixon!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But, in spite of all her friends'' urgency, and her own wish of\\r\\nseeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs.\\r\\nBates?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel\\r\\nand Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should\\r\\nrecommend; and indeed they particularly <i>wish</i> her to try her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.\\r\\nDixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no\\r\\nremarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be\\r\\ncompared with Miss Fairfax.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly\\r\\nnot. There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was\\r\\nabsolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, that of course.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of\\r\\nNovember, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well\\r\\nsince. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never\\r\\nmentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so\\r\\nconsiderate!--But however, she is so far from well, that her kind\\r\\nfriends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air\\r\\nthat always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four\\r\\nmonths at Highbury will entirely cure her-- and it is certainly a great\\r\\ndeal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is\\r\\nunwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the\\r\\nCampbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following-- as\\r\\nyou will find from Jane''s letter. So sudden!--You may guess, dear Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the\\r\\ndrawback of her illness--but I am afraid we must expect to see her\\r\\ngrown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky\\r\\nthing happened to me, as to that. I always make a point of reading\\r\\nJane''s letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my\\r\\nmother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress\\r\\nher. Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day\\r\\nwith my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her\\r\\nbeing unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poor\\r\\nJane is ill!''-- which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly,\\r\\nand was sadly alarmed at. However, when I read on, I found it was not\\r\\nnear so bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to\\r\\nher, that she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I\\r\\ncould be so off my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call\\r\\nin Mr. Perry. The expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so\\r\\nliberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to\\r\\ncharge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you\\r\\nknow. He has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be giving\\r\\naway his time. Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane\\r\\nwrites about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her\\r\\nown story a great deal better than I can tell it for her.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am afraid we must be running away,\" said Emma, glancing at\\r\\nHarriet, and beginning to rise--\"My father will be expecting us. I had\\r\\nno intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five\\r\\nminutes, when I first entered the house. I merely called, because I\\r\\nwould not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have\\r\\nbeen so pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs.\\r\\nBates good morning.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She\\r\\nregained the street--happy in this, that though much had been forced on\\r\\nher against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance\\r\\nof Jane Fairfax''s letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.</p>'", "id": 161, "section_id": 186},{"content": " '<h3>SCENE I.

Fairfax of the ______________ regiment of\\r\\ninfantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure,\\r\\nhope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy\\r\\nremembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking under\\r\\nconsumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.</p>\\r\\n<p>By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on\\r\\nlosing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the\\r\\nconsolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed\\r\\nevery probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being\\r\\ntaught only what very limited means could command, and growing up with\\r\\nno advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what\\r\\nnature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and\\r\\nwarm-hearted, well-meaning relations.</p>\\r\\n<p>But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a\\r\\nchange to her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly\\r\\nregarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man;\\r\\nand farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a\\r\\nsevere camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims\\r\\nwhich he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from\\r\\nthe death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any\\r\\nthing in his power. When he did return, he sought out the child and\\r\\ntook notice of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a\\r\\ngirl, about Jane''s age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long\\r\\nvisits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years\\r\\nold, his daughter''s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a\\r\\nreal friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of\\r\\nundertaking the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and\\r\\nfrom that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell''s family, and\\r\\nhad lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time\\r\\nto time.</p>\\r\\n<p>The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the\\r\\nvery few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making\\r\\nindependence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of\\r\\nColonel Campbell''s power; for though his income, by pay and\\r\\nappointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all\\r\\nhis daughter''s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be\\r\\nsupplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.</p>\\r\\n<p>Such was Jane Fairfax''s history. She had fallen into good hands,\\r\\nknown nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an\\r\\nexcellent education. Living constantly with right-minded and\\r\\nwell-informed people, her heart and understanding had received every\\r\\nadvantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell''s residence\\r\\nbeing in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by\\r\\nthe attendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities\\r\\nwere equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or\\r\\nnineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the\\r\\ncare of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself;\\r\\nbut she was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor\\r\\nmother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil\\r\\nday was put off. It was easy to decide that she was still too young;\\r\\nand Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the\\r\\nrational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of\\r\\nhome and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering\\r\\nsuggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this\\r\\nmight soon be over.</p>\\r\\n<p>The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss\\r\\nCampbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from the\\r\\ncircumstance of Jane''s decided superiority both in beauty and\\r\\nacquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\\r\\nby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by\\r\\nthe parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till\\r\\nthe marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so\\r\\noften defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to\\r\\nwhat is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the\\r\\naffections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as\\r\\nsoon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled,\\r\\nwhile Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.</p>\\r\\n<p>This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to\\r\\nbe yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her\\r\\npath of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment\\r\\nhad fixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\\r\\nshould be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she\\r\\nhad resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire\\r\\nfrom all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society,\\r\\npeace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.</p>\\r\\n<p>The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a\\r\\nresolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no\\r\\nexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and\\r\\nfor their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this\\r\\nwould be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon.\\r\\nPerhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have\\r\\nresisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of\\r\\nsuch enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still,\\r\\nhowever, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not\\r\\nhurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since\\r\\nthe time of their daughter''s marriage; and till she should have\\r\\ncompletely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging\\r\\nin duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame\\r\\nand varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,\\r\\nto require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be\\r\\ndischarged with tolerable comfort.</p>\\r\\n<p>With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to\\r\\nher aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths\\r\\nnot told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\\r\\nHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with\\r\\nthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\\r\\nwhatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,\\r\\nor treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that\\r\\nthey depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the\\r\\nrecovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she\\r\\nwas to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect\\r\\nnovelty which had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must\\r\\nput up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the\\r\\nfreshness of a two years'' absence.</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not\\r\\nlike through three long months!--to be always doing more than she\\r\\nwished, and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax\\r\\nmight be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told\\r\\nher it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman,\\r\\nwhich she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had\\r\\nbeen eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of\\r\\nself-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her.\\r\\nBut \"she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how it\\r\\nwas, but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent\\r\\nindifference whether she pleased or not--and then, her aunt was such an\\r\\neternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and\\r\\nit had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate--because\\r\\ntheir ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fond\\r\\nof each other.\" These were her reasons-- she had no better.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so\\r\\nmagnified by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time\\r\\nafter any considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured\\r\\nher; and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two\\r\\nyears'' interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance\\r\\nand manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\\r\\nJane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself\\r\\nthe highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as\\r\\nalmost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;\\r\\nher figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,\\r\\nbetween fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed\\r\\nto point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all\\r\\nthis; and then, her face--her features-- there was more beauty in them\\r\\naltogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very\\r\\npleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and\\r\\neyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she\\r\\nhad been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and\\r\\ndelicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty,\\r\\nof which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in\\r\\nhonour, by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of\\r\\nperson or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be\\r\\nvulgar, was distinction, and merit.</p>\\r\\n<p>In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax\\r\\nwith twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of\\r\\nrendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no\\r\\nlonger. When she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as\\r\\nher beauty; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to,\\r\\nwhat she was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed\\r\\nimpossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if\\r\\nto every well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added\\r\\nthe highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which\\r\\nshe had so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be\\r\\nmore pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved\\r\\non. Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr.\\r\\nDixon''s actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her\\r\\nimagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be\\r\\nsimple, single, successless love on her side alone. She might have been\\r\\nunconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his\\r\\nconversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,\\r\\nmight now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to\\r\\ndivide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon\\r\\nbeginning her career of laborious duty.</p>\\r\\n<p>Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable\\r\\nfeelings, as made her look around in walking home, and lament that\\r\\nHighbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;\\r\\nnobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.</p>\\r\\n<p>These were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she had\\r\\ncommitted herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for\\r\\nJane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and\\r\\nerrors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, \"She certainly is handsome; she\\r\\nis better than handsome!\" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with\\r\\nher grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its\\r\\nusual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome\\r\\nas ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to\\r\\nadmiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of\\r\\nexactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how\\r\\nsmall a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of\\r\\nnew caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane''s\\r\\noffences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the\\r\\nthanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an\\r\\naffectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off\\r\\nin higher style her own very superior performance. She was, besides,\\r\\nwhich was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting\\r\\nat her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed\\r\\ndetermined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciously\\r\\nreserved.</p>\\r\\n<p>If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more\\r\\nreserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She\\r\\nseemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon''s character, or\\r\\nher own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the\\r\\nmatch. It was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing\\r\\ndelineated or distinguished. It did her no service however. Her caution\\r\\nwas thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first\\r\\nsurmises. There probably <i>was</i> something more to conceal than her\\r\\nown preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one\\r\\nfriend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake\\r\\nof the future twelve thousand pounds.</p>\\r\\n<p>The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank\\r\\nChurchill had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they\\r\\nwere a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could\\r\\nEmma procure as to what he truly was. \"Was he handsome?\"--\"She believed\\r\\nhe was reckoned a very fine young man.\" \"Was he agreeable?\"-- \"He was\\r\\ngenerally thought so.\" \"Did he appear a sensible young man; a young man\\r\\nof information?\"--\"At a watering-place, or in a common London\\r\\nacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were\\r\\nall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\\r\\nthey had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his\\r\\nmanners pleasing.\" Emma could not forgive her.</p>'", "id": 163, "section_id": 189},{"content": " '<h3>SCENE IV.

They had received her\\r\\ndoubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace\\r\\nhad been talked almost all the time-- till just at last, when Mrs.\\r\\nMartin''s saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was\\r\\ngrown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner.\\r\\nIn that very room she had been measured last September, with her two\\r\\nfriends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot\\r\\nby the window. <i>He</i> had done it. They all seemed to remember the\\r\\nday, the hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness,\\r\\nthe same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding;\\r\\nand they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma\\r\\nmust suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,)\\r\\nwhen the carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit,\\r\\nand the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen\\r\\nminutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six\\r\\nweeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel\\r\\nhow justly they might resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was\\r\\na bad business. She would have given a great deal, or endured a great\\r\\ndeal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so\\r\\ndeserving, that a <i>little</i> higher should have been enough: but as\\r\\nit was, how could she have done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not\\r\\nrepent. They must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in\\r\\nthe process-- so much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the\\r\\nnecessity of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of\\r\\nRandalls to procure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the\\r\\nMartins. The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that\\r\\nneither \"master nor mistress was at home;\" they had both been out some\\r\\ntime; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"This is too bad,\" cried Emma, as they turned away. \"And now we\\r\\nshall just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so\\r\\ndisappointed.\" And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\\r\\nmurmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both-- such being\\r\\nthe commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the\\r\\ncarriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who\\r\\nwere standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight\\r\\nof them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr.\\r\\nWeston immediately accosted her with,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How d''ye do?--how d''ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--\\r\\nglad to see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter this\\r\\nmorning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty-- he is at\\r\\nOxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\\r\\nso. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\\r\\nwas always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\\r\\njust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall\\r\\nenjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could\\r\\nwish.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\\r\\ninfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston''s, confirmed as it all was\\r\\nby the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but\\r\\nnot less to the purpose. To know that <i>she</i> thought his coming\\r\\ncertain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she\\r\\nrejoice in their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted\\r\\nspirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was\\r\\ncoming; and in the rapidity of half a moment''s thought, she hoped Mr.\\r\\nElton would now be talked of no more.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,\\r\\nwhich allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his\\r\\ncommand, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she\\r\\nlistened, and smiled, and congratulated.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,\" said he, at the conclusion.</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his wife.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We had better move on, Mr. Weston,\" said she, \"we are detaining the girls.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well, well, I am ready;\"--and turning again to Emma, \"but you must not be expecting such a <i>very</i> fine young man; you have only had <i>my</i>\\r\\naccount you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:\"--\\r\\nthough his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very\\r\\ndifferent conviction.</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o''clock,\" was Mrs.\\r\\nWeston''s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only\\r\\nfor her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Four o''clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,\" was Mr.\\r\\nWeston''s quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\\r\\nEmma''s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a\\r\\ndifferent air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as\\r\\nbefore. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least\\r\\nmust soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw\\r\\nsomething like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\"-- was a question, however, which did not augur much.</p>\\r\\n<p>But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and\\r\\nEmma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.</p>\\r\\n<p>The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston''s\\r\\nfaithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve\\r\\no''clock, that she was to think of her at four.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My dear, dear anxious friend,\"--said she, in mental soliloquy,\\r\\nwhile walking downstairs from her own room, \"always overcareful for\\r\\nevery body''s comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little\\r\\nfidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure that all is\\r\\nright.\" The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. \"''Tis\\r\\ntwelve; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by\\r\\nthis time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of\\r\\nthe possibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring\\r\\nhim soon.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her\\r\\nfather--Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few\\r\\nminutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of\\r\\nFrank''s being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the\\r\\nmidst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared,\\r\\nto have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was\\r\\nactually before her--he was presented to her, and she did not think too\\r\\nmuch had been said in his praise; he was a <i>very</i> good looking\\r\\nyoung man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his\\r\\ncountenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his\\r\\nfather''s; he looked quick and sensible. She felt immediately that she\\r\\nshould like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a\\r\\nreadiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be\\r\\nacquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.</p>\\r\\n<p>He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the\\r\\neagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel\\r\\nearlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I told you yesterday,\" cried Mr. Weston with exultation, \"I told\\r\\nyou all that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what\\r\\nI used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help\\r\\ngetting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in\\r\\nupon one''s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal\\r\\nmore than any little exertion it needs.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,\" said the young\\r\\nman, \"though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\\r\\nbut in coming <i>home</i> I felt I might do any thing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The word <i>home</i> made his father look on him with fresh\\r\\ncomplacency. Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself\\r\\nagreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed. He was\\r\\nvery much pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged\\r\\nhouse, would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the\\r\\nsituation, the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more,\\r\\nand professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the\\r\\ncountry which none but one''s <i>own</i> country gives, and the\\r\\ngreatest curiosity to visit it. That he should never have been able to\\r\\nindulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously through Emma''s\\r\\nbrain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and\\r\\npleasantly handled. His manner had no air of study or exaggeration. He\\r\\ndid really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment.</p>\\r\\n<p>Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening\\r\\nacquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,--\"Was she a\\r\\nhorsewoman?--Pleasant rides?-- Pleasant walks?--Had they a large\\r\\nneighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There were\\r\\nseveral very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls--had they\\r\\nballs?--Was it a musical society?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\\r\\nproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while\\r\\ntheir two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his\\r\\nmother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so\\r\\nmuch warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured\\r\\nto his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an\\r\\nadditional proof of his knowing how to please-- and of his certainly\\r\\nthinking it worth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word\\r\\nof praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs.\\r\\nWeston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He\\r\\nunderstood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. \"His\\r\\nfather''s marriage,\" he said, \"had been the wisest measure, every friend\\r\\nmust rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a\\r\\nblessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest\\r\\nobligation on him.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor''s merits,\\r\\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\\r\\nwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse''s\\r\\ncharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor''s. And at last, as if\\r\\nresolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\\r\\nobject, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of\\r\\nher person.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,\" said he; \"but I\\r\\nconfess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a\\r\\nvery tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that\\r\\nI was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,\" said Emma; \"were you to guess her to be <i>eighteen</i>, I should listen with pleasure; but <i>she</i>\\r\\nwould be ready to quarrel with you for using such words. Don''t let her\\r\\nimagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I hope I should know better,\" he replied; \"no, depend upon it,\\r\\n(with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should\\r\\nunderstand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought\\r\\nextravagant in my terms.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected\\r\\nfrom their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her\\r\\nmind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be\\r\\nconsidered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must\\r\\nsee more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they\\r\\nwere agreeable.</p>\\r\\n<p>She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His\\r\\nquick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a\\r\\nhappy expression; and even, when he might have determined not to look,\\r\\nshe was confident that he was often listening.</p>\\r\\n<p>Her own father''s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\\r\\nentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\\r\\nwas a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from\\r\\napproving matrimony than from foreseeing it.-- Though always objecting\\r\\nto every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from\\r\\nthe apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of\\r\\nany two persons'' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till\\r\\nit were proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He\\r\\ncould now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without\\r\\na glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to\\r\\nall his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.\\r\\nFrank Churchill''s accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils\\r\\nof sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed\\r\\nanxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold--which,\\r\\nhowever, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till\\r\\nafter another night.</p>\\r\\n<p>A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--\"He must be\\r\\ngoing. He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many\\r\\nerrands for Mrs. Weston at Ford''s, but he need not hurry any body\\r\\nelse.\" His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,\\r\\nsaying,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the\\r\\nopportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other,\\r\\nand therefore may as well be paid now. I have the honour of being\\r\\nacquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady\\r\\nresiding in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall\\r\\nhave no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I\\r\\nbelieve, is not the proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates.\\r\\nDo you know any family of that name?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To be sure we do,\" cried his father; \"Mrs. Bates--we passed her\\r\\nhouse-- I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted\\r\\nwith Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl\\r\\nshe is. Call upon her, by all means.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There is no necessity for my calling this morning,\" said the young\\r\\nman; \"another day would do as well; but there was that degree of\\r\\nacquaintance at Weymouth which--\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done\\r\\ncannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\\r\\nany want of attention to her <i>here</i> should be carefully avoided.\\r\\nYou saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body\\r\\nshe mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has\\r\\nbarely enough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The son looked convinced.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,\" said Emma; \"she is a very elegant young woman.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He agreed to it, but with so quiet a \"Yes,\" as inclined her almost\\r\\nto doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct\\r\\nsort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be\\r\\nthought only ordinarily gifted with it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her\\r\\nand hear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has\\r\\nan aunt who never holds her tongue.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?\" said Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; \"then give\\r\\nme leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young\\r\\nlady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very\\r\\nworthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely\\r\\nglad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to\\r\\nshew you the way.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\\r\\nquite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many\\r\\nhouses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\\r\\nunless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you\\r\\nhad best cross the street.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he\\r\\ncould, and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, \"My good\\r\\nfriend, this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when\\r\\nhe sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates''s, he may get there from the Crown in\\r\\na hop, step, and jump.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one,\\r\\nand a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma\\r\\nremained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and\\r\\ncould now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day,\\r\\nwith full confidence in their comfort.</p>'", "id": 168, "section_id": 195},{"content": " '<h3>SCENE I.

Her mother had\\r\\ndied too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance\\r\\nof her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman\\r\\nas governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse''s family, less\\r\\nas a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but\\r\\nparticularly of Emma. Between <i>them</i> it was more the intimacy of\\r\\nsisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office\\r\\nof governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to\\r\\nimpose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed\\r\\naway, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually\\r\\nattached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss\\r\\nTaylor''s judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.</p>\\r\\n<p>The real evils, indeed, of Emma''s situation were the power of having\\r\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\\r\\nwell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\\r\\nher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so\\r\\nunperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with\\r\\nher.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\r\\ndisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor''s\\r\\nloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\\r\\nbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\\r\\ncontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father\\r\\nand herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to\\r\\ncheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after\\r\\ndinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she\\r\\nhad lost.</p>\\r\\n<p>The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston\\r\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\\r\\npleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with\\r\\nwhat self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\\r\\npromoted the match; but it was a black morning''s work for her. The want\\r\\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\\r\\npast kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she\\r\\nhad taught and how she had played with her from five years old--how she\\r\\nhad devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health--and how\\r\\nnursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\\r\\ngratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,\\r\\nthe equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\\r\\nIsabella''s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\\r\\ndearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\\r\\nas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\\r\\nall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\\r\\npeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\\r\\nhers--one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who\\r\\nhad such an affection for her as could never find fault.</p>\\r\\n<p>How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was\\r\\ngoing only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be\\r\\nthe difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a\\r\\nMiss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and\\r\\ndomestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual\\r\\nsolitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.\\r\\nHe could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.</p>\\r\\n<p>The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse\\r\\nhad not married early) was much increased by his constitution and\\r\\nhabits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity\\r\\nof mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and\\r\\nthough everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his\\r\\namiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.</p>\\r\\n<p>Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,\\r\\nbeing settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her\\r\\ndaily reach; and many a long October and November evening must be\\r\\nstruggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit\\r\\nfrom Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the\\r\\nhouse, and give her pleasant society again.</p>\\r\\n<p>Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a\\r\\ntown, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and\\r\\nshrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The\\r\\nWoodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She\\r\\nhad many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally\\r\\ncivil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss\\r\\nTaylor for even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could\\r\\nnot but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father\\r\\nawoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required\\r\\nsupport. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body\\r\\nthat he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of\\r\\nevery kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always\\r\\ndisagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own\\r\\ndaughter''s marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion,\\r\\nthough it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now\\r\\nobliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle\\r\\nselfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could\\r\\nfeel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss\\r\\nTaylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have\\r\\nbeen a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at\\r\\nHartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep\\r\\nhim from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him\\r\\nnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is\\r\\nsuch a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly\\r\\ndeserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with\\r\\nus for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house\\r\\nof her own?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her\\r\\nown? This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,\\r\\nmy dear.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We shall be always meeting! <i>We</i> must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could not walk half so far.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to be sure.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such\\r\\na little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying\\r\\nour visit?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"They are to be put into Mr. Weston''s stable, papa. You know we have\\r\\nsettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\\r\\nnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\\r\\nto Randalls, because of his daughter''s being housemaid there. I only\\r\\ndoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\\r\\npapa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\\r\\nmentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would\\r\\nnot have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I\\r\\nam sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,\\r\\npretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her,\\r\\nshe always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and\\r\\nwhen you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns\\r\\nthe lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she\\r\\nwill be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor\\r\\nMiss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see.\\r\\nWhenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will be\\r\\nhearing of us. He will be able to tell her how we all are.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\\r\\nhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through\\r\\nthe evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\\r\\nbackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\\r\\nwalked in and made it unnecessary.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was\\r\\nnot only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\r\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella''s husband. He lived\\r\\nabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\\r\\nand at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\\r\\nmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\\r\\nsome days'' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\\r\\nwell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\\r\\nalways did him good; and his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and\\r\\nher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse gratefully observed, \"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\\r\\nto come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must\\r\\nhave had a shocking walk.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch cold.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\\r\\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\\r\\nbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of\\r\\nwhat sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with\\r\\nmy congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did\\r\\nyou all behave? Who cried most?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! ''Tis a sad business.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly\\r\\nsay `poor Miss Taylor.'' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but\\r\\nwhen it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any\\r\\nrate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Especially when <i>one</i> of those two is such a fanciful,\\r\\ntroublesome creature!\" said Emma playfully. \"That is what you have in\\r\\nyour head, I know--and what you would certainly say if my father were\\r\\nnot by.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,\\r\\nwith a sigh. \"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean <i>you</i>, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean <i>you</i>.\\r\\nWhat a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only myself. Mr. Knightley loves\\r\\nto find fault with me, you know-- in a joke--it is all a joke. We\\r\\nalways say what we like to one another.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see\\r\\nfaults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:\\r\\nand though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she\\r\\nknew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have\\r\\nhim really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect\\r\\nby every body.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Emma knows I never flatter her,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"but I meant\\r\\nno reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two\\r\\npersons to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she\\r\\nmust be a gainer.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well,\" said Emma, willing to let it pass--\"you want to hear about\\r\\nthe wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\\r\\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:\\r\\nnot a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that\\r\\nwe were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting\\r\\nevery day.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father. \"But, Mr.\\r\\nKnightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\\r\\nsure she <i>will</i> miss her more than she thinks for.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. \"It is\\r\\nimpossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\" said Mr.\\r\\nKnightley. \"We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\\r\\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor''s\\r\\nadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor''s\\r\\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\\r\\nher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\\r\\nherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\\r\\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma, \"and a\\r\\nvery considerable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match,\\r\\nyou know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in\\r\\nthe right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,\\r\\nmay comfort me for any thing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, \"Ah!\\r\\nmy dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\\r\\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\\r\\nmatches.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,\\r\\nfor other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after\\r\\nsuch success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never\\r\\nmarry again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long,\\r\\nand who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly\\r\\noccupied either in his business in town or among his friends here,\\r\\nalways acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful-- Mr. Weston need\\r\\nnot spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh\\r\\nno! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even\\r\\ntalked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son\\r\\nand the uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked\\r\\non the subject, but I believed none of it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I\\r\\nmet with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he\\r\\ndarted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us\\r\\nfrom Farmer Mitchell''s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the\\r\\nmatch from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this\\r\\ninstance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off\\r\\nmatch-making.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not understand what you mean by `success,''\" said Mr.\\r\\nKnightley. \"Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and\\r\\ndelicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years\\r\\nto bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady''s\\r\\nmind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you\\r\\ncall it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle\\r\\nday, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr.\\r\\nWeston were to marry her,'' and saying it again to yourself every now\\r\\nand then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit?\\r\\nWhat are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and <i>that</i> is all that can be said.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky\\r\\nguess?-- I pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a\\r\\nlucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it.\\r\\nAnd as to my poor word `success,'' which you quarrel with, I do not know\\r\\nthat I am so entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two\\r\\npretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something between\\r\\nthe do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston''s\\r\\nvisits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many\\r\\nlittle matters, it might not have come to any thing after all. I think\\r\\nyou must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\\r\\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\\r\\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\\r\\ngood to them, by interference.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\"\\r\\nrejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. \"But, my dear, pray\\r\\ndo not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one''s\\r\\nfamily circle grievously.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like\\r\\nMr. Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody\\r\\nin Highbury who deserves him--and he has been here a whole year, and\\r\\nhas fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to\\r\\nhave him single any longer--and I thought when he was joining their\\r\\nhands to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the\\r\\nsame kind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this\\r\\nis the only way I have of doing him a service.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good\\r\\nyoung man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew\\r\\nhim any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.\\r\\nThat will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so\\r\\nkind as to meet him.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\" said Mr.\\r\\nKnightley, laughing, \"and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a\\r\\nmuch better thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best\\r\\nof the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.\\r\\nDepend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of\\r\\nhimself.\"</p>'", "id": 82, "section_id": 103},{"content": " '<h3>SCENE IV.</h3><blockquote><i>Enter ROSS and an old Man</i></blockquote><a><b>Old Man</b></a><blockquote><a>Threescore and ten I can remember well:</a><br /><a>Within the volume of which time I have seen</a><br /><a>Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night</a><br /><a>Hath trifled former knowings.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ROSS</b></a><blockquote><a>Ah, good father,</a><br /><a>Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man''s act,</a><br /><a>Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, ''tis day,</a><br /><a>And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:</a><br /><a>Is''t night''s predominance, or the day''s shame,</a><br /><a>That darkness does the face of earth entomb,</a><br /><a>When living light should kiss it?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>Old Man</b></a><blockquote><a>''Tis unnatural,</a><br /><a>Even like the deed that''s done.

From the dawn of philosophy, the question\\r\\nconcerning the <i>summum bonum</i>, or, what is the same thing, concerning\\r\\nthe foundation of morality, has been accounted the main problem in\\r\\nspeculative thought, has occupied the most gifted intellects, and\\r\\ndivided them into sects and schools, carrying on a vigorous warfare\\r\\nagainst one another. And after more than two thousand years the same\\r\\ndiscussions continue, philosophers are still ranged under the same\\r\\ncontending banners, and neither thinkers nor mankind at large seem\\r\\nnearer to being unanimous on the subject, than when the youth Socrates\\r\\nlistened to the old Protagoras, and asserted (if Plato''s dialogue be\\r\\ngrounded on a real conversation) the theory of utilitarianism against\\r\\nthe popular morality of the so-called sophist.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is true that similar confusion and uncertainty, and in some cases\\r\\nsimilar discordance, exist respecting the first principles of all the\\r\\nsciences, not excepting that which is deemed the most certain of them,\\r\\nmathematics; without much impairing, generally indeed without impairing\\r\\nat all, the trustworthiness of the conclusions of those sciences. An\\r\\napparent anomaly, the explanation of which is, that the detailed\\r\\ndoctrines of a science are not usually deduced from, nor depend for\\r\\ntheir evidence upon, what are called its first principles. Were it not\\r\\nso, there would be no science more precarious, or whose conclusions were\\r\\nmore insufficiently made out, than algebra; which derives none of its\\r\\ncertainty from what are commonly taught to learners as its elements,\\r\\nsince these, as laid down by some of its most eminent teachers, are as\\r\\nfull of fictions as English law, and of mysteries as theology. The\\r\\ntruths which are ultimately accepted as the first principles of a\\r\\nscience, are really the last results of metaphysical analysis, practised\\r\\non the elementary notions with which the science is conversant; and\\r\\ntheir relation to the science is not that of foundations to an edifice,\\r\\nbut of roots to a tree, which may perform their office equally well\\r\\nthough they be never dug down to and exposed to light. But though in\\r\\nscience the particular truths precede the general theory, the contrary\\r\\nmight be expected to be the case with a practical art, such as morals or\\r\\nlegislation. All action is for the sake of some end, and rules of\\r\\naction, it seems natural to suppose, must take their whole character\\r\\nand colour from the end to which they are subservient. When we engage in\\r\\na pursuit, a clear and precise conception of what we are pursuing would\\r\\nseem to be the first thing we need, instead of the last we are to look\\r\\nforward to. A test of right and wrong must be the means, one would\\r\\nthink, of ascertaining what is right or wrong, and not a consequence of\\r\\nhaving already ascertained it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The difficulty is not avoided by having recourse to the popular theory\\r\\nof a natural faculty, a sense or instinct, informing us of right and\\r\\nwrong. For&mdash;besides that the existence of such a moral instinct is\\r\\nitself one of the matters in dispute&mdash;those believers in it who have any\\r\\npretensions to philosophy, have been obliged to abandon the idea that it\\r\\ndiscerns what is right or wrong in the particular case in hand, as our\\r\\nother senses discern the sight or sound actually present. Our moral\\r\\nfaculty, according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled to\\r\\nthe name of thinkers, supplies us only with the general principles of\\r\\nmoral judgments; it is a branch of our reason, not of our sensitive\\r\\nfaculty; and must be looked to for the abstract doctrines of morality,\\r\\nnot for perception of it in the concrete. The intuitive, no less than\\r\\nwhat may be termed the inductive, school of ethics, insists on the\\r\\nnecessity of general laws. They both agree that the morality of an\\r\\nindividual action is not a question of direct perception, but of the\\r\\napplication of a law to an individual case. They recognise also, to a\\r\\ngreat extent, the same moral laws; but differ as to their evidence, and\\r\\nthe source from which they derive their authority. According to the one\\r\\nopinion, the principles of morals are evident <i>&agrave; priori</i>, requiring\\r\\nnothing to command assent, except that the meaning of the terms be\\r\\nunderstood. According to the other doctrine, right and wrong, as well as\\r\\ntruth and falsehood, are questions of observation and experience. But\\r\\nboth hold equally that morality must be deduced from principles; and the\\r\\nintuitive school affirm as strongly as the inductive, that there is a\\r\\nscience of morals. Yet they seldom attempt to make out a list of the <i>&agrave;\\r\\npriori</i> principles which are to serve as the premises of the science;\\r\\nstill more rarely do they make any effort to reduce those various\\r\\nprinciples to one first principle, or common ground of obligation. They\\r\\neither assume the ordinary precepts of morals as of <i>&agrave; priori</i>\\r\\nauthority, or they lay down as the common groundwork of those maxims,\\r\\nsome generality much less obviously authoritative than the maxims\\r\\nthemselves, and which has never succeeded in gaining popular acceptance.\\r\\nYet to support their pretensions there ought either to be some one\\r\\nfundamental principle or law, at the root of all morality, or if there\\r\\nbe several, there should be a determinate order of precedence among\\r\\nthem; and the one principle, or the rule for deciding between the\\r\\nvarious principles when they conflict, ought to be self-evident.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To inquire how far the bad effects of this deficiency have been\\r\\nmitigated in practice, or to what extent the moral beliefs of mankind\\r\\nhave been vitiated or made uncertain by the absence of any distinct\\r\\nrecognition of an ultimate standard, would imply a complete survey and\\r\\ncriticism of past and present ethical doctrine. It would, however, be\\r\\neasy to show that whatever steadiness or consistency these moral beliefs\\r\\nhave attained, has been mainly due to the tacit influence of a standard\\r\\nnot recognised. Although the non-existence of an acknowledged first\\r\\nprinciple has made ethics not so much a guide as a consecration of men''s\\r\\nactual sentiments, still, as men''s sentiments, both of favour and of\\r\\naversion, are greatly influenced by what they suppose to be the effects\\r\\nof things upon their happiness, the principle of utility, or as Bentham\\r\\nlatterly called it, the greatest happiness principle, has had a large\\r\\nshare in forming the moral doctrines even of those who most scornfully\\r\\nreject its authority. Nor is there any school of thought which refuses\\r\\nto admit that the influence of actions on happiness is a most material\\r\\nand even predominant consideration in many of the details of morals,\\r\\nhowever unwilling to acknowledge it as the fundamental principle of\\r\\nmorality, and the source of moral obligation. I might go much further,\\r\\nand say that to all those <i>&agrave; priori</i> moralists who deem it necessary to\\r\\nargue at all, utilitarian arguments are indispensable. It is not my\\r\\npresent purpose to criticise these thinkers; but I cannot help\\r\\nreferring, for illustration, to a systematic treatise by one of the most\\r\\nillustrious of them, the <i>Metaphysics of Ethics</i>, by Kant. This\\r\\nremarkable man, whose system of thought will long remain one of the\\r\\nlandmarks in the history of philosophical speculation, does, in the\\r\\ntreatise in question, lay down an universal first principle as the\\r\\norigin and ground of moral obligation; it is this:&mdash;''So act, that the\\r\\nrule on which thou actest would admit of being adopted as a law by all\\r\\nrational beings.'' But when he begins to deduce from this precept any of\\r\\nthe actual duties of morality, he fails, almost grotesquely, to show\\r\\nthat there would be any contradiction, any logical (not to say\\r\\nphysical) impossibility, in the adoption by all rational beings of the\\r\\nmost outrageously immoral rules of conduct. All he shows is that the\\r\\n<i>consequences</i> of their universal adoption would be such as no one would\\r\\nchoose to incur.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On the present occasion, I shall, without further discussion of the\\r\\nother theories, attempt to contribute something towards the\\r\\nunderstanding and appreciation of the Utilitarian or Happiness theory,\\r\\nand towards such proof as it is susceptible of. It is evident that this\\r\\ncannot be proof in the ordinary and popular meaning of the term.\\r\\nQuestions of ultimate ends are not amenable to direct proof. Whatever\\r\\ncan be proved to be good, must be so by being shown to be a means to\\r\\nsomething admitted to be good without proof. The medical art is proved\\r\\nto be good, by its conducing to health; but how is it possible to prove\\r\\nthat health is good? The art of music is good, for the reason, among\\r\\nothers, that it produces pleasure; but what proof is it possible to give\\r\\nthat pleasure is good? If, then, it is asserted that there is a\\r\\ncomprehensive formula, including all things which are in themselves\\r\\ngood, and that whatever else is good, is not so as an end, but as a\\r\\nmean, the formula may be accepted or rejected, but is not a subject of\\r\\nwhat is commonly understood by proof. We are not, however, to infer that\\r\\nits acceptance or rejection must depend on blind impulse, or arbitrary\\r\\nchoice. There is a larger meaning of the word proof, in which this\\r\\nquestion is as amenable to it as any other of the disputed questions of\\r\\nphilosophy. The subject is within the cognizance of the rational\\r\\nfaculty; and neither does that faculty deal with it solely in the way\\r\\nof intuition. Considerations may be presented capable of determining the\\r\\nintellect either to give or withhold its assent to the doctrine; and\\r\\nthis is equivalent to proof.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We shall examine presently of what nature are these considerations; in\\r\\nwhat manner they apply to the case, and what rational grounds,\\r\\ntherefore, can be given for accepting or rejecting the utilitarian\\r\\nformula. But it is a preliminary condition of rational acceptance or\\r\\nrejection, that the formula should be correctly understood. I believe\\r\\nthat the very imperfect notion ordinarily formed of its meaning, is the\\r\\nchief obstacle which impedes its reception; and that could it be\\r\\ncleared, even from only the grosser misconceptions, the question would\\r\\nbe greatly simplified, and a large proportion of its difficulties\\r\\nremoved. Before, therefore, I attempt to enter into the philosophical\\r\\ngrounds which can be given for assenting to the utilitarian standard, I\\r\\nshall offer some illustrations of the doctrine itself; with the view of\\r\\nshowing more clearly what it is, distinguishing it from what it is not,\\r\\nand disposing of such of the practical objections to it as either\\r\\noriginate in, or are closely connected with, mistaken interpretations of\\r\\nits meaning. Having thus prepared the ground, I shall afterwards\\r\\nendeavour to throw such light as I can upon the question, considered as\\r\\none of philosophical theory.</p>'", "id": 482, "section_id": 585},{"content": " ''", "id": 39, "section_id": 50},{"content": " '<h3>SCENE II.</h3><blockquote><i>Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS</i></blockquote><a><b>LADY MACDUFF</b></a><blockquote><a>What had he done, to make him fly the land?</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ROSS</b></a><blockquote><a>You must have patience, madam.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LADY MACDUFF</b></a><blockquote><a>He had none:</a><br /><a>His flight was madness: when our actions do not,</a><br /><a>Our fears do make us traitors.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>ROSS</b></a><blockquote><a>You know not</a><br /><a>Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.</a><br /></blockquote><a><b>LADY MACDUFF</b></a><blockquote><a>Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,</a><br /><a>His mansion and his titles in a place</a><br /><a>From whence himself does fly?

The subject speaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting in the world. It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth in the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind. \\r\\n</p><p>This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth. \\r\\n</p><p>Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of the offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under one government. \\r\\n</p><p>It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this nature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties. For in politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution. \\r\\n</p><p>And yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the bitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty. An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants. \\r\\n</p><p>In the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye, my fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general scope of them, that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes, my countrymen, I own to you that, after having given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it. I am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I affect not reserves which I do not feel. I will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when I have decided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness of good intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply professions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of my own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace the cause of truth. \\r\\n</p><p>I propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting particulars: \\r\\n</p><ul>\\r\\n<li>THE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY<br />\\r\\n</li><li>THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION <br />\\r\\n</li><li>THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT <br />\\r\\n</li><li>THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT <br />\\r\\n</li><li>ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION <br />\\r\\n</li><li>and lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT, TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.<br /></li></ul>\\r\\n<p>In the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention. \\r\\n</p><p>It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be imagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too great extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the whole.<a><sup>1</sup></a> This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident, to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment of the Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the advantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution. This shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address. \\r\\n</p><p><i><b>PUBLIUS.</b></i> </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a>1</a>.

It was this: the knocking at the gate, which succeeds to the<br />murder of Duncan, produced to my feelings an effect for which I never could<br />account. The effect was, that it reflected back upon the murder a peculiar<br />awfulness and a depth of solemnity; yet, however obstinately I endeavored<br />with my understanding to comprehend this, for many years I never could see<br /><i>why</i> it should produce such an effect.<br /><br />Here I pause for one moment, to exhort the reader never to pay any<br />attention to his understanding when it stands in opposition to any<br />other faculty of his mind. The mere understanding, however useful and<br />indispensable, is the meanest faculty in the human mind, and the most to<br />be distrusted; and yet the great majority of people trust to nothing else;<br />which may do for ordinary life, but not for philosophical purposes. Of this<br />out of ten thousand instances that I might produce, I will cite one. Ask of<br />any person whatsoever, who is not previously prepared for the demand by<br />a knowledge of perspective, to draw in the rudest way the commonest<br />appearance which depends upon the laws of that science; as for instance, to<br />represent the effect of two walls standing at right angles to each other,<br />or the appearance of the houses on each side of a street, as seen by a<br />person looking down the street from one extremity. Now in all cases, unless<br />the person has happened to observe in pictures how it is that artists<br />produce these effects, he will be utterly unable to make the smallest<br />approximation to it. Yet why? For he has actually seen the effect every day<br />of his life. The reason is--that he allows his understanding to overrule<br />his eyes. His understanding, which includes no intuitive knowledge of the<br />laws of vision, can furnish him with no reason why a line which is known<br />and can be proved to be a horizontal line, should not _appear_ a horizontal<br />line; a line that made any angle with the perpendicular less than a right<br />angle, would seem to him to indicate that his houses were all tumbling down<br />together. Accordingly he makes the line of his houses a horizontal line,<br />and fails of course to produce the effect demanded. Here then is one<br />instance out of many, in which not only the understanding is allowed to<br />overrule the eyes, but where the understanding is positively allowed to<br />obliterate the eyes as it were, for not only does the man believe the<br />evidence of his understanding in opposition to that of his eyes, but,<br />(what is monstrous!) the idiot is not aware that his eyes ever gave such<br />evidence. He does not know that he has seen (and therefore _quoad_ his<br />consciousness has <i>not</i> seen) that which he <i>has</i> seen every day of his<br />life. But to return from this digression, my understanding could furnish no<br />reason why the knocking at the gate in Macbeth should produce any effect,<br />direct or reflected. In fact, my understanding said positively that it<br />could <i>not</i> produce any effect. But I knew better; I felt that it did; and<br />I waited and clung to the problem until further knowledge should enable me<br />to solve it. At length, in 1812, Mr. Williams made his <i>d&eacute;but</i> on the stage<br />of Ratcliffe Highway, and executed those unparalleled murders which have<br />procured for him such a brilliant and undying reputation. On which murders,<br />by the way, I must observe, that in one respect they have had an ill<br />effect, by making the connoisseur in murder very fastidious in his taste,<br />and dissatisfied by anything that has been since done in that line. All<br />other murders look pale by the deep crimson of his; and, as an amateur once<br />said to me in a querulous tone, \"There has been absolutely nothing <i>doing</i><br />since his time, or nothing that''s worth speaking of.\" But this is wrong;<br />for it is unreasonable to expect all men to be great artists, and born with<br />the genius of Mr. Williams. Now it will be remembered that in the first of<br />these murders, (that of the Marrs,) the same incident (of a knocking at the<br />door soon after the work of extermination was complete) did actually occur,<br />which the genius of Shakspeare has invented; and all good judges, and<br />the most eminent dilettanti, acknowledged the felicity of Shakspeare''s<br />suggestion as soon as it was actually realized. Here, then, was a fresh<br />proof that I was right in relying on my own feeling in opposition to my<br />understanding; and I again set myself to study the problem; at length<br />I solved it to my own satisfaction; and my solution is this. Murder in<br />ordinary cases, where the sympathy is wholly directed to the case of the<br />murdered person, is an incident of coarse and vulgar horror; and for this<br />reason, that it flings the interest exclusively upon the natural but<br />ignoble instinct by which we cleave to life; an instinct, which, as being<br />indispensable to the primal law of self-preservation, is the same in kind,<br />(though different in degree,) amongst all living creatures; this instinct<br />therefore, because it annihilates all distinctions, and degrades the<br />greatest of men to the level of \"the poor beetle that we tread on,\"<br />exhibits human nature in its most abject and humiliating attitude. Such an<br />attitude would little suit the purposes of the poet. What then must he<br />do? He must throw the interest on the murderer. Our sympathy must be with<br />_him_; (of course I mean a sympathy of comprehension, a sympathy by which<br />we enter into his feelings, and are made to understand them,--not a<br />sympathy [1] of pity or approbation.) In the murdered person all strife of<br />thought, all flux and reflux of passion and of purpose, are crushed by one<br />overwhelming panic; the fear of instant death smites him \"with its petrific<br />mace.\" But in the murderer, such a murderer as a poet will condescend to,<br />there must be raging some great storm of passion,--jealousy, ambition,<br />vengeance, hatred,--which will create a hell within him; and into this hell<br />we are to look.<br /><br />In Macbeth, for the sake of gratifying his own enormous and teeming faculty<br />of creation, Shakspeare has introduced two murderers: and, as usual in his<br />hands, they are remarkably discriminated: but, though in Macbeth the strife<br />of mind is greater than in his wife, the tiger spirit not so awake, and his<br />feelings caught chiefly by contagion from her,--yet, as both were finally<br />involved in the guilt of murder, the murderous mind of necessity is finally<br />to be presumed in both. This was to be expressed; and on its own account,<br />as well as to make it a more proportionable antagonist to the unoffending<br />nature of their victim, \"the gracious Duncan,\" and adequately to expound<br />\"the deep damnation of his taking off,\" this was to be expressed with<br />peculiar energy. We were to be made to feel that the human nature, _i.e._,<br />the divine nature of love and mercy, spread through the hearts of all<br />creatures, and seldom utterly withdrawn from man,--was gone, vanished,<br />extinct; and that the fiendish nature had taken its place. And, as this<br />effect is marvellously accomplished in the _dialogues_ and _soliloquies_<br />themselves, so it is finally consummated by the expedient under<br />consideration; and it is to this that I now solicit the reader''s attention.<br />If the reader has ever witnessed a wife, daughter, or sister, in a fainting<br />fit, he may chance to have observed that the most affecting moment in<br />such a spectacle, is _that_ in which a sigh and a stirring announce the<br />recommencement of suspended life. Or, if the reader has ever been present<br />in a vast metropolis, on the day when some great national idol was carried<br />in funeral pomp to his grave, and chancing to walk near the course through<br />which it passed, has felt powerfully, in the silence and desertion of the<br />streets and in the stagnation of ordinary business, the deep interest which<br />at that moment was possessing the heart of man,--if all at once he should<br />hear the death-like stillness broken up by the sound of wheels rattling<br />away from the scene, and making known that the transitory vision was<br />dissolved, he will be aware that at no moment was his sense of the complete<br />suspension and pause in ordinary human concerns so full and affecting, as<br />at that moment when the suspension ceases, and the goings-on of human<br />life are suddenly resumed. All action in any direction is best expounded,<br />measured, and made apprehensible, by reaction. Now apply this to the case<br />in Macbeth. Here, as I have said, the retiring of the human heart and the<br />entrance of the fiendish heart was to be expressed and made sensible.<br />Another world has stepped in; and the murderers are taken out of the region<br />of human things, human purposes, human desires. They are transfigured: Lady<br />Macbeth is \"unsexed;\" Macbeth has forgot that he was born of woman; both<br />are conformed to the image of devils; and the world of devils is suddenly<br />revealed. But how shall this be conveyed and made palpable? In order that a<br />new world may step in, this world must for a time disappear. The murderers,<br />and the murder, must be insulated--cut off by an immeasurable gulph<br />from the ordinary tide and succession of human affairs--locked up and<br />sequestered in some deep recess; we must be made sensible that the world<br />of ordinary life is suddenly arrested--laid asleep--tranced--racked into<br />a dread armistice: time must be annihilated; relation to things without<br />abolished; and all must pass self-withdrawn into a deep syncope and<br />suspension of earthly passion. Hence it is, that when the deed is done,<br />when the work of darkness is perfect, then the world of darkness passes<br />away like a pageantry in the clouds: the knocking at the gate is heard; and<br />it makes known audibly that the reaction has commenced: the human has made<br />its reflux upon the fiendish; the pulses of life are beginning to beat<br />again; and the re-establishment of the goings-on of the world in which we<br />live, first makes us profoundly sensible of the awful parenthesis that had<br />suspended them.<br /><br />O, mighty poet! Thy works are not as those of other men, simply and merely<br />great works of art; but are also like the phenomena of nature, like the sun<br />and the sea, the stars and the flowers,--like frost and snow, rain and dew,<br />hail-storm and thunder, which are to be studied with entire submission of<br />our own faculties, and in the perfect faith that in them there can be no<br />too much or too little, nothing useless or inert--but that, the further<br />we press in our discoveries, the more we shall see proofs of design and<br />self-supporting arrangement where the careless eye had seen nothing but<br />accident!'", "id": 81, "section_id": 95},{"content": " '<p>Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable\\r\\nfamily, which for the last two or three generations had been rising\\r\\ninto gentility and property.

Some scruples and\\r\\nsome reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as\\r\\nthey were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to\\r\\nthe care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own\\r\\ncomfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.</p>\\r\\n<p>A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia\\r\\nand engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way\\r\\nin London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern\\r\\nwhich brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in\\r\\nHighbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful\\r\\noccupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty\\r\\nyears of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time,\\r\\nrealised an easy competence--enough to secure the purchase of a little\\r\\nestate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for--enough to\\r\\nmarry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according\\r\\nto the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\\r\\nschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it\\r\\nhad not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\\r\\npurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\\r\\nbut he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\\r\\naccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\\r\\nhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\\r\\nprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\\r\\nnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\\r\\neven in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\\r\\na well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\\r\\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\\r\\nchosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.</p>\\r\\n<p>He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his\\r\\nown; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\\r\\nuncle''s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\\r\\nthe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely,\\r\\ntherefore, that he should ever want his father''s assistance. His father\\r\\nhad no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and\\r\\ngoverned her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston''s nature to\\r\\nimagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,\\r\\nand, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in\\r\\nLondon, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\\r\\nyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was\\r\\nlooked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and\\r\\nprospects a kind of common concern.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\\r\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\\r\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\\r\\nhis father had been often talked of but never achieved.</p>\\r\\n<p>Now, upon his father''s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as\\r\\na most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was\\r\\nnot a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank\\r\\ntea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the\\r\\nvisit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and\\r\\nthe hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his\\r\\nnew mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in\\r\\nHighbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had\\r\\nreceived. \"I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank\\r\\nChurchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very\\r\\nhandsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw\\r\\nthe letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his\\r\\nlife.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\\r\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\\r\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\\r\\nwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\\r\\nwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\\r\\nfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate\\r\\nshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\\r\\nseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\\r\\nwho could ill bear to part with her.</p>\\r\\n<p>She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,\\r\\nwithout pain, of Emma''s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an\\r\\nhour''s ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was\\r\\nof no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation than most\\r\\ngirls would have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that\\r\\nmight be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little\\r\\ndifficulties and privations. And then there was such comfort in the\\r\\nvery easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even\\r\\nsolitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston''s disposition and\\r\\ncircumstances, which would make the approaching season no hindrance to\\r\\ntheir spending half the evenings in the week together.</p>\\r\\n<p>Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to\\r\\nMrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her\\r\\nmore than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so\\r\\napparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken\\r\\nby surprize at his being still able to pity `poor Miss Taylor,'' when\\r\\nthey left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or\\r\\nsaw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a\\r\\ncarriage of her own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse''s\\r\\ngiving a gentle sigh, and saying, \"Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be\\r\\nvery glad to stay.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing\\r\\nto pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\\r\\nThe compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\\r\\nbeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\\r\\nhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could\\r\\nbear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\\r\\ndifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as\\r\\nunfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade\\r\\nthem from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\\r\\nearnestly tried to prevent any body''s eating it. He had been at the\\r\\npains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr.\\r\\nPerry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were\\r\\none of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse''s life; and upon being applied to,\\r\\nhe could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\\r\\nof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\\r\\nmany--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\\r\\nopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\\r\\nevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\\r\\nand there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys\\r\\nbeing seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston''s wedding-cake in their hands:\\r\\nbut Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.</p>'", "id": 83, "section_id": 104},{"content": " '<p>Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much\\r\\nto have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,\\r\\nfrom his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his\\r\\nfortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of\\r\\nhis own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\\r\\nintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\\r\\nhours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance\\r\\nbut such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him,\\r\\nHighbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in\\r\\nthe parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many\\r\\nsuch. Not unfrequently, through Emma''s persuasion, he had some of the\\r\\nchosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he\\r\\npreferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to\\r\\ncompany, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could\\r\\nnot make up a card-table for him.</p>\\r\\n<p>Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;\\r\\nand by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the\\r\\nprivilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude\\r\\nfor the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse''s drawing-room, and the\\r\\nsmiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.</p>\\r\\n<p>After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom\\r\\nwere Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always\\r\\nat the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched\\r\\nand carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship\\r\\nfor either James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it\\r\\nwould have been a grievance.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\\r\\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\\r\\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\\r\\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\\r\\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\\r\\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\\r\\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\\r\\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\\r\\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\\r\\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\\r\\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was\\r\\ndevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a\\r\\nsmall income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and\\r\\na woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal\\r\\ngood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved\\r\\nevery body, was interested in every body''s happiness, quicksighted to\\r\\nevery body''s merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and\\r\\nsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good\\r\\nneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The\\r\\nsimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful\\r\\nspirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to\\r\\nherself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly\\r\\nsuited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless\\r\\ngossip.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an\\r\\nestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\\r\\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant\\r\\nmorality, upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies\\r\\nfor enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a\\r\\nreal, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\\r\\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where\\r\\ngirls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into\\r\\na little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard''s school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury\\r\\nwas reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and\\r\\ngarden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about\\r\\na great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with\\r\\nher own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now\\r\\nwalked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\\r\\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to\\r\\nthe occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse''s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her\\r\\nneat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win\\r\\nor lose a few sixpences by his fireside.</p>\\r\\n<p>These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able\\r\\nto collect; and happy was she, for her father''s sake, in the power;\\r\\nthough, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the\\r\\nabsence of Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look\\r\\ncomfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things\\r\\nso well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that\\r\\nevery evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had\\r\\nfearfully anticipated.</p>\\r\\n<p>As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of\\r\\nthe present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in\\r\\nmost respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a\\r\\nmost welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma\\r\\nknew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account\\r\\nof her beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening\\r\\nno longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had\\r\\nplaced her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard''s school, and somebody\\r\\nhad lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of\\r\\nparlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.\\r\\nShe had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\\r\\nwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\\r\\nladies who had been at school there with her.</p>\\r\\n<p>She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\\r\\nwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\\r\\nfine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of\\r\\ngreat sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much\\r\\npleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to\\r\\ncontinue the acquaintance.</p>\\r\\n<p>She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith''s\\r\\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\\r\\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\\r\\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\\r\\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by\\r\\nthe appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\\r\\nbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\\r\\nEncouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\\r\\nnatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of\\r\\nHighbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed\\r\\nwere unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though\\r\\nvery good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of\\r\\nthe name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a\\r\\nlarge farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of\\r\\nDonwell--very creditably, she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought\\r\\nhighly of them--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit\\r\\nto be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge\\r\\nand elegance to be quite perfect. <i>She</i> would notice her; she\\r\\nwould improve her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and\\r\\nintroduce her into good society; she would form her opinions and her\\r\\nmanners. It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind\\r\\nundertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure,\\r\\nand powers.</p>\\r\\n<p>She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and\\r\\nlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the\\r\\nevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which\\r\\nalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and\\r\\nwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to\\r\\nthe fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common\\r\\nimpulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of\\r\\ndoing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a\\r\\nmind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of\\r\\nthe meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped\\r\\noysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the\\r\\nearly hours and civil scruples of their guests.</p>\\r\\n<p>Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad\\r\\nwarfare. He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the\\r\\nfashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very\\r\\nunwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while\\r\\nhis hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his\\r\\ncare for their health made him grieve that they would eat.</p>\\r\\n<p>Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he\\r\\ncould, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might\\r\\nconstrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer\\r\\nthings, to say:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An\\r\\negg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an\\r\\negg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any\\r\\nbody else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you\\r\\nsee--one of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help\\r\\nyou to a <i>little</i> bit of tart--a <i>very</i> little bit. Ours are\\r\\nall apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here.\\r\\nI do not advise the custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to <i>half</i> a glass of wine? A <i>small</i> half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a much\\r\\nmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular\\r\\npleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was\\r\\nquite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage\\r\\nin Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much\\r\\npanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with\\r\\nhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken\\r\\nhands with her at last!</p>'", "id": 84, "section_id": 105},{"content": " '<p>Harriet Smith''s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.\\r\\nQuick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting,\\r\\nencouraging, and telling her to come very often; and as their\\r\\nacquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a\\r\\nwalking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might\\r\\nfind her. In that respect Mrs. Weston''s loss had been important. Her\\r\\nfather never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the\\r\\nground sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year\\r\\nvaried; and since Mrs. Weston''s marriage her exercise had been too much\\r\\nconfined. She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not\\r\\npleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at\\r\\nany time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges. But\\r\\nin every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was\\r\\nconfirmed in all her kind designs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,\\r\\ngrateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring\\r\\nto be guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to\\r\\nherself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and\\r\\npower of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there\\r\\nwas no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be\\r\\nexpected. Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith''s being\\r\\nexactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the something which her\\r\\nhome required. Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question.\\r\\nTwo such could never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was\\r\\nquite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent.\\r\\nMrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude\\r\\nand esteem. Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.\\r\\nFor Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.</p>\\r\\n<p>Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out\\r\\nwho were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell\\r\\nevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma\\r\\nwas obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that\\r\\nin the same situation <i>she</i> should not have discovered the truth.\\r\\nHarriet had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe\\r\\njust what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the\\r\\nschool in general, formed naturally a great part of the\\r\\nconversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\\r\\nAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied\\r\\nher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with\\r\\nthem, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\\r\\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her\\r\\ntalkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and\\r\\nenjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\\r\\nexultation of Mrs. Martin''s having \"<i>two</i> parlours, two very good\\r\\nparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard''s\\r\\ndrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived\\r\\nfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of\\r\\nthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch\\r\\ncow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin''s saying as she was so fond of it, it\\r\\nshould be called <i>her</i> cow; and of their having a very handsome\\r\\nsummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to\\r\\ndrink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen\\r\\npeople.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate\\r\\ncause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings\\r\\narose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and\\r\\ndaughter, a son and son''s wife, who all lived together; but when it\\r\\nappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\\r\\nalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\\r\\nsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\\r\\nMartin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\\r\\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were\\r\\nnot taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.</p>\\r\\n<p>With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and\\r\\nmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\\r\\nand there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to\\r\\nspeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\\r\\nevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very\\r\\ngood-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in\\r\\norder to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was\\r\\nof them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his\\r\\nshepherd''s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\\r\\nShe was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She\\r\\nbelieved he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a very\\r\\nfine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his\\r\\nwool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke well\\r\\nof him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had\\r\\ntold her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was\\r\\nimpossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,\\r\\nwhenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she <i>wanted</i> him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well done, Mrs. Martin!\" thought Emma. \"You know what you are about.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\\r\\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\\r\\nseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\\r\\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\\r\\nher.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business? He does not read?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has read a\\r\\ngood deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\\r\\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the\\r\\nwindow seats--but he reads all <i>them</i> to himself. But sometimes\\r\\nof an evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud\\r\\nout of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read\\r\\nthe Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor\\r\\nThe Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I\\r\\nmentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he\\r\\ncan.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The next question was--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\\r\\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\\r\\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now\\r\\nand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to\\r\\nKingston. He has passed you very often.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without\\r\\nhaving any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on\\r\\nfoot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The\\r\\nyeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have\\r\\nnothing to do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might\\r\\ninterest me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or\\r\\nother. But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one\\r\\nsense, as much above my notice as in every other he is below it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\\r\\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\\r\\nhis age to be?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\\r\\n23rd just a fortnight and a day''s difference--which is very odd.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\\r\\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as\\r\\nthey are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would\\r\\nprobably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort\\r\\nof young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it\\r\\nmight be very desirable.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are\\r\\nnot born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune\\r\\nentirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever\\r\\nmoney he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of\\r\\nthe family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his\\r\\nstock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may\\r\\nbe rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised\\r\\nany thing yet.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\\r\\nindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\\r\\nof taking a boy another year.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\\r\\nmarry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though his\\r\\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\\r\\nto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\\r\\nto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\\r\\ncareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\\r\\ngentleman''s daughter, and you must support your claim to that station\\r\\nby every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people\\r\\nwho would take pleasure in degrading you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at\\r\\nHartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid\\r\\nof what any body can do.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I\\r\\nwould have you so firmly established in good society, as to be\\r\\nindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you\\r\\npermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to\\r\\nhave as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if\\r\\nyou should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you\\r\\nmay not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted\\r\\nwith the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer''s daughter,\\r\\nwithout education.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any\\r\\nbody but what had had some education--and been very well brought up.\\r\\nHowever, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your''s--and I am\\r\\nsure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always\\r\\nhave a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and\\r\\nshould be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well\\r\\neducated as me. But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,\\r\\ncertainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\\r\\nalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer,\\r\\nbut she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no\\r\\nserious difficulty, on Harriet''s side, to oppose any friendly\\r\\narrangement of her own.</p>\\r\\n<p>They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\\r\\nDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\\r\\nher, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\\r\\nnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\\r\\nyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\\r\\nsufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\\r\\nneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\\r\\nother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she\\r\\nthought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet''s\\r\\ninclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\\r\\nnoticed her father''s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\\r\\nMartin looked as if he did not know what manner was.</p>\\r\\n<p>They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not\\r\\nbe kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling\\r\\nface, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon\\r\\nto compose.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was\\r\\nquite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did\\r\\nnot think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards\\r\\nRandalls most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the\\r\\nForest yet. He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he\\r\\nquite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should\\r\\nhappen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected?\\r\\nWhat do you think of him? Do you think him so very plain?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is\\r\\nnothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to\\r\\nexpect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could\\r\\nbe so very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I\\r\\nconfess, a degree or two nearer gentility.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To be sure,\" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \"he is not so genteel as real gentlemen.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\\r\\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\\r\\nmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At\\r\\nHartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred\\r\\nmen. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in\\r\\ncompany with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very\\r\\ninferior creature--and rather wondering at yourself for having ever\\r\\nthought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?\\r\\nWere not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward\\r\\nlook and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to\\r\\nbe wholly unmodulated as I stood here.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air\\r\\nand way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough.\\r\\nBut Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mr. Knightley''s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with <i>him</i>. You might not see one in a hundred with <i>gentleman</i>\\r\\nso plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the only\\r\\ngentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston and\\r\\nMr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of <i>them</i>. Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You must see the difference.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\\r\\ngrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\\r\\nbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\\r\\nawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\\r\\nage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\\r\\nWeston''s time of life?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There is no saying, indeed,\" replied Harriet rather solemnly.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely\\r\\ngross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking\\r\\nof nothing but profit and loss.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\\r\\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\\r\\nHe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\\r\\nelse--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to\\r\\ndo with books? And I have no doubt that he <i>will</i> thrive, and be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb <i>us</i>.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I wonder he did not remember the book\"--was all Harriet''s answer,\\r\\nand spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might\\r\\nbe safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time.\\r\\nHer next beginning was,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton''s manners are superior to Mr.\\r\\nKnightley''s or Mr. Weston''s. They have more gentleness. They might be\\r\\nmore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\\r\\nalmost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in <i>him</i>,\\r\\nbecause there is so much good-humour with it--but that would not do to\\r\\nbe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley''s downright, decided, commanding\\r\\nsort of manner, though it suits <i>him</i> very well; his figure, and\\r\\nlook, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were\\r\\nto set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary,\\r\\nI think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton\\r\\nas a model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.\\r\\nHe seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\\r\\nwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\\r\\nHarriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\\r\\nsofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to\\r\\nplease you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from\\r\\nMr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,\\r\\nand said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\\r\\nfarmer out of Harriet''s head. She thought it would be an excellent\\r\\nmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her\\r\\nto have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\\r\\nelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\\r\\nbody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\\r\\nentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet''s coming to\\r\\nHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense of\\r\\nits expediency. Mr. Elton''s situation was most suitable, quite the\\r\\ngentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of\\r\\nany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\\r\\nHe had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\\r\\nincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\\r\\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\\r\\nas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\\r\\ndeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.</p>\\r\\n<p>She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a\\r\\nbeautiful girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at\\r\\nHartfield, was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet''s there\\r\\ncould be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would\\r\\nhave all the usual weight and efficacy. And he was really a very\\r\\npleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might\\r\\nlike. He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in\\r\\ngeneral, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature\\r\\nwhich she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified\\r\\nby a Robert Martin''s riding about the country to get walnuts for her\\r\\nmight very well be conquered by Mr. Elton''s admiration.</p>'", "id": 85, "section_id": 107},{"content": " '<p>\"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr.\\r\\nKnightley, \"of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but\\r\\nI think it a bad thing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I think they will neither of them do the other any good.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her\\r\\nwith a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I\\r\\nhave been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very\\r\\ndifferently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good! This\\r\\nwill certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.\\r\\nKnightley.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\\r\\nWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he\\r\\nthinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only\\r\\nyesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there\\r\\nshould be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr.\\r\\nKnightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You\\r\\nare so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a\\r\\ncompanion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a\\r\\nwoman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to\\r\\nit all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is\\r\\nnot the superior young woman which Emma''s friend ought to be. But on\\r\\nthe other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an\\r\\ninducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. She\\r\\nmeans it, I know.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years\\r\\nold. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times\\r\\nof books that she meant to read regularly through--and very good lists\\r\\nthey were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes\\r\\nalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up\\r\\nwhen only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\\r\\ncredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\\r\\nout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of\\r\\nsteady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring\\r\\nindustry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\\r\\nunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\\r\\naffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade\\r\\nher to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I dare say,\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"that I thought so <i>then</i>;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma''s omitting to do any thing I wished.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as <i>that</i>,\"--said\\r\\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. \"But I,\"\\r\\nhe soon added, \"who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\\r\\nstill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\\r\\nof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able\\r\\nto answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was\\r\\nalways quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since\\r\\nshe was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In\\r\\nher mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits\\r\\nher mother''s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on <i>your</i>\\r\\nrecommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse''s family and wanted another\\r\\nsituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\\r\\nany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" said he, smiling. \"You are better placed <i>here</i>; very\\r\\nfit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing\\r\\nyourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.\\r\\nYou might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would\\r\\nseem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from <i>her</i>,\\r\\non the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and\\r\\ndoing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a\\r\\nwife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and\\r\\nthat with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.\\r\\nWe will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness\\r\\nof comfort, or his son may plague him.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I hope not <i>that</i>.--It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not foretell vexation from that quarter.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to\\r\\nEmma''s genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart,\\r\\nthe young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in\\r\\nfortune.--But Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.\\r\\nI think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly\\r\\nhave. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every\\r\\nthing. She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,\\r\\nbecause undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma\\r\\nimagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting\\r\\nsuch a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to\\r\\nsay that <i>she</i> cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will\\r\\nonly put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to.\\r\\nShe will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among\\r\\nwhom birth and circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken\\r\\nif Emma''s doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a\\r\\ngirl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in\\r\\nlife.--They only give a little polish.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I either depend more upon Emma''s good sense than you do, or am more\\r\\nanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\\r\\nHow well she looked last night!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma''s being pretty.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have\\r\\nseldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a\\r\\npartial old friend.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular\\r\\nfeatures, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full\\r\\nhealth, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright\\r\\nfigure! There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her\\r\\nhead, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture of\\r\\nhealth;'' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete\\r\\npicture of grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is\\r\\nnot she?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\" he replied. \"I think\\r\\nher all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this\\r\\npraise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very\\r\\nhandsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity\\r\\nlies another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike\\r\\nof Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\\r\\ndoing them any harm. With all dear Emma''s little faults, she is an\\r\\nexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\\r\\nsister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\\r\\ntrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\\r\\nlasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred\\r\\ntimes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel,\\r\\nand I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and\\r\\nIsabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind\\r\\naffection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not\\r\\nquite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their\\r\\nopinions with me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or\\r\\nunkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider\\r\\nmyself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that\\r\\nEmma''s mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not\\r\\nthink any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith''s intimacy being\\r\\nmade a matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but\\r\\nsupposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the\\r\\nintimacy, it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but\\r\\nher father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end\\r\\nto it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself. It has been so\\r\\nmany years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,\\r\\nMr. Knightley, at this little remains of office.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Not at all,\" cried he; \"I am much obliged to you for it. It is very\\r\\ngood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often\\r\\nfound; for it shall be attended to.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about her sister.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Be satisfied,\" said he, \"I will not raise any outcry. I will keep\\r\\nmy ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma.\\r\\nIsabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater\\r\\ninterest; perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in\\r\\nwhat one feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So do I,\" said Mrs. Weston gently, \"very much.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means\\r\\njust nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a\\r\\nman she cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much\\r\\nin love with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in\\r\\nsome doubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody\\r\\nhereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her\\r\\nresolution at present,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"as can well be; and while\\r\\nshe is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any\\r\\nattachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse''s account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma,\\r\\nthough I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her\\r\\nown and Mr. Weston''s on the subject, as much as possible. There were\\r\\nwishes at Randalls respecting Emma''s destiny, but it was not desirable\\r\\nto have them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley\\r\\nsoon afterwards made to \"What does Weston think of the weather; shall\\r\\nwe have rain?\" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise\\r\\nabout Hartfield.</p>'", "id": 86, "section_id": 108},{"content": " '<p><br clear=\"&quot;all&quot;\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet''s fancy a proper\\r\\ndirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good\\r\\npurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.\\r\\nElton''s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;\\r\\nand as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his\\r\\nadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of\\r\\ncreating as much liking on Harriet''s side, as there could be any\\r\\noccasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton''s being in the\\r\\nfairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had no\\r\\nscruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so\\r\\nwarmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little\\r\\ntime would not add. His perception of the striking improvement of\\r\\nHarriet''s manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of\\r\\nthe least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You have given Miss Smith all that she required,\" said he; \"you\\r\\nhave made her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she\\r\\ncame to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\\r\\ninfinitely superior to what she received from nature.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only\\r\\nwanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all\\r\\nthe natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I\\r\\nhave done very little.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"If it were admissible to contradict a lady,\" said the gallant Mr. Elton--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\\r\\ntaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition more truly amiable.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have no doubt of it.\" And it was spoken with a sort of sighing\\r\\nanimation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased\\r\\nanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,\\r\\nto have Harriet''s picture.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?\" said she: \"did you ever sit for your picture?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say, with a very interesting naivete,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! dear, no, never.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I\\r\\nwould give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness\\r\\nmyself. You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had\\r\\na great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my\\r\\nfriends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from\\r\\none cause or another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could\\r\\nalmost venture, if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight\\r\\nto have her picture!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Let me entreat you,\" cried Mr. Elton; \"it would indeed be a\\r\\ndelight! Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a\\r\\ntalent in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How\\r\\ncould you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of\\r\\nyour landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable\\r\\nfigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with\\r\\ntaking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don''t pretend to be in\\r\\nraptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet''s face. \"Well, if\\r\\nyou give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try\\r\\nwhat I can do. Harriet''s features are very delicate, which makes a\\r\\nlikeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the\\r\\neye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I\\r\\nhave not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do\\r\\nit, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She\\r\\nthinks so little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of\\r\\nanswering me? How completely it meant, `why should my picture be\\r\\ndrawn?''\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately\\r\\nmade; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against\\r\\nthe earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work\\r\\ndirectly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various\\r\\nattempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that\\r\\nthey might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many\\r\\nbeginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\\r\\npencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had\\r\\nalways wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in\\r\\ndrawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as\\r\\nshe would ever submit to. She played and sang;--and drew in almost\\r\\nevery style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had\\r\\nshe approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad\\r\\nto command, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived\\r\\nas to her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not\\r\\nunwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for\\r\\naccomplishment often higher than it deserved.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the\\r\\nmost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had\\r\\nthere been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two\\r\\ncompanions would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A\\r\\nlikeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse''s performances must be\\r\\ncapital.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No great variety of faces for you,\" said Emma. \"I had only my own\\r\\nfamily to study from. There is my father--another of my father--but the\\r\\nidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\\r\\ntake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\\r\\nagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\\r\\nkindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\\r\\nThere is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant\\r\\nfigure!--and the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of\\r\\nher, if she would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have\\r\\nme draw her four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come\\r\\nall my attempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henry\\r\\nand John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one\\r\\nof them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\\r\\ndrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\\r\\nor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\\r\\nany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\\r\\ncoarser featured than any of mama''s children ever were. Here is my\\r\\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\\r\\nthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\\r\\nwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That''s\\r\\nvery like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa\\r\\nis very good. Then here is my last,\"--unclosing a pretty sketch of a\\r\\ngentleman in small size, whole-length--\"my last and my best--my\\r\\nbrother, Mr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished,\\r\\nwhen I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another\\r\\nlikeness. I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and\\r\\nwhen I had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I\\r\\nwere quite agreed in thinking it <i>very</i> like)--only too\\r\\nhandsome--too flattering--but that was a fault on the right side--after\\r\\nall this, came poor dear Isabella''s cold approbation of--\"Yes, it was a\\r\\nlittle like--but to be sure it did not do him justice.\" We had had a\\r\\ngreat deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all. It was made a\\r\\ngreat favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I\\r\\nnever would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable\\r\\nlikeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and, as I\\r\\nsaid, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again. But for\\r\\nHarriet''s sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and\\r\\nwives in the case <i>at</i> <i>present</i>, I will break my resolution now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and\\r\\nwas repeating, \"No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\\r\\nyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,\" with so interesting a\\r\\nconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\\r\\nleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\\r\\ndeclaration must wait a little longer.</p>\\r\\n<p>She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a\\r\\nwhole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley''s, and was\\r\\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable\\r\\nstation over the mantelpiece.</p>\\r\\n<p>The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of\\r\\nnot keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet\\r\\nmixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But\\r\\nthere was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and\\r\\nwatching every touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where\\r\\nhe might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to\\r\\nput an end to it, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then\\r\\noccurred to her to employ him in reading.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\\r\\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\\r\\nthe irksomeness of Miss Smith''s.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in\\r\\npeace. She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any\\r\\nthing less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was\\r\\nready at the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see\\r\\nthe progress, and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such\\r\\nan encourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost\\r\\nbefore it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and\\r\\nhis complaisance were unexceptionable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\\r\\npleased with the first day''s sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\\r\\nof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\\r\\nto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\\r\\nheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its\\r\\nbeing in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its\\r\\ndestined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of the\\r\\nbeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with\\r\\nas many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton''s very promising\\r\\nattachment was likely to add.</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he\\r\\nought, entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them\\r\\nagain.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and\\r\\nsatisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole\\r\\nprogress of the picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw\\r\\nit was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended\\r\\nit through every criticism.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\\r\\nwanted,\"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting that\\r\\nshe was addressing a lover.--\"The expression of the eye is most\\r\\ncorrect, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the\\r\\nfault of her face that she has them not.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Do you think so?\" replied he. \"I cannot agree with you. It appears\\r\\nto me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\\r\\nlikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You have made her too tall, Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley.</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider,\\r\\nshe is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which in\\r\\nshort gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must be preserved,\\r\\nyou know. Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it gives one exactly\\r\\nthe idea of such a height as Miss Smith''s. Exactly so indeed!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is very pretty,\" said Mr. Woodhouse. \"So prettily done! Just as\\r\\nyour drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so\\r\\nwell as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she\\r\\nseems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\\r\\nshoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer. Look at the tree.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You, sir, may say any thing,\" cried Mr. Elton, \"but I must confess\\r\\nthat I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out\\r\\nof doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any\\r\\nother situation would have been much less in character. The naivete of\\r\\nMiss Smith''s manners--and altogether--Oh, it is most admirable! I\\r\\ncannot keep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a\\r\\nfew difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London;\\r\\nthe order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose\\r\\ntaste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all\\r\\ncommissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in\\r\\nthe fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr.\\r\\nElton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert.\\r\\n\"Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should\\r\\nhe have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It was\\r\\nimpossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on\\r\\nsuch an errand.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not\\r\\ngive him such a troublesome office for the world,\"--brought on the\\r\\ndesired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few\\r\\nminutes settled the business.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and\\r\\ngive the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure\\r\\nits safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful\\r\\nof not being incommoded enough.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What a precious deposit!\" said he with a tender sigh, as he received it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"This man is almost too gallant to be in love,\" thought Emma. \"I\\r\\nshould say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways\\r\\nof being in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\\r\\nexactly; it will be an `Exactly so,'' as he says himself; but he does\\r\\nsigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\\r\\nendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.\\r\\nBut it is his gratitude on Harriet''s account.\"</p>'", "id": 87, "section_id": 109},{"content": " '<p><br clear=\"&quot;all&quot;\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>The very day of Mr. Elton''s going to London produced a fresh\\r\\noccasion for Emma''s services towards her friend. Harriet had been at\\r\\nHartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone\\r\\nhome to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been\\r\\ntalked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\\r\\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a\\r\\nminute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to\\r\\nMrs. Goddard''s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and\\r\\nfinding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\\r\\nlittle parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\\r\\nopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs\\r\\nwhich she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this\\r\\nletter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal\\r\\nof marriage. \"Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did\\r\\nnot know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good\\r\\nletter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her\\r\\nvery much--but she did not know--and so, she was come as fast as she\\r\\ncould to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.--\" Emma was\\r\\nhalf-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Upon my word,\" she cried, \"the young man is determined not to lose\\r\\nany thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Will you read the letter?\" cried Harriet. \"Pray do. I''d rather you would.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The\\r\\nstyle of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not\\r\\nmerely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have\\r\\ndisgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and\\r\\nunaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of\\r\\nthe writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,\\r\\nliberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it,\\r\\nwhile Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a \"Well,\\r\\nwell,\" and was at last forced to add, \"Is it a good letter? or is it\\r\\ntoo short?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, indeed, a very good letter,\" replied Emma rather slowly--\"so\\r\\ngood a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\\r\\nsisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I\\r\\nsaw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\\r\\nleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;\\r\\nno, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\\r\\nwoman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\\r\\ntalent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when he takes a pen in\\r\\nhand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men.\\r\\nYes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments\\r\\nto a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet\\r\\n(returning it,) than I had expected.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well,\" said the still waiting Harriet;--\"well--and--and what shall I do?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this letter?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and speedily.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will\\r\\nexpress yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your\\r\\nnot being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\\r\\nunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and\\r\\nconcern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\\r\\npresent themselves unbidden to <i>your</i> mind, I am persuaded. You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You think I ought to refuse him then,\" said Harriet, looking down.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in\\r\\nany doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have\\r\\nbeen under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if\\r\\nyou feel in doubt as to the <i>purport</i> of your answer. I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would\\r\\nyou advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to\\r\\ndo.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\\r\\nwith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I had no notion that he liked me so very much,\" said Harriet,\\r\\ncontemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\\r\\nsilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\\r\\nletter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman <i>doubts</i>\\r\\nas to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to\\r\\nrefuse him. If she can hesitate as to `Yes,'' she ought to say `No''\\r\\ndirectly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful\\r\\nfeelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and\\r\\nolder than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I\\r\\nwant to influence you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you\\r\\nwould just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--As\\r\\nyou say, one''s mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be\\r\\nhesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say `No,''\\r\\nperhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?''\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Not for the world,\" said Emma, smiling graciously, \"would I advise\\r\\nyou either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If\\r\\nyou prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\\r\\nagreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\\r\\nhesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at this\\r\\nmoment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\\r\\nyourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this\\r\\nmoment whom are you thinking of?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned\\r\\naway confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the\\r\\nletter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about\\r\\nwithout regard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without\\r\\nstrong hopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as\\r\\nwell as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really\\r\\nalmost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\\r\\nwhat you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to\\r\\nmyself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation\\r\\nin approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have\\r\\ngrieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the\\r\\nconsequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest\\r\\ndegree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not\\r\\ninfluence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could\\r\\nnot have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am\\r\\nsecure of you for ever.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You could not have visited me!\" she cried, looking aghast. \"No, to\\r\\nbe sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would\\r\\nhave been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would\\r\\nnot give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any\\r\\nthing in the world.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but\\r\\nit must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good\\r\\nsociety. I must have given you up.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dear affectionate creature!--<i>You</i> banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--<i>You</i>\\r\\nconfined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I\\r\\nwonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must\\r\\nhave a pretty good opinion of himself.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not think he is conceited either, in general,\" said Harriet,\\r\\nher conscience opposing such censure; \"at least, he is very good\\r\\nnatured, and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great\\r\\nregard for--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know,\\r\\nthough he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainly\\r\\nI must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if\\r\\none comes to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison\\r\\nat all, <i>one</i> is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do\\r\\nreally think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great\\r\\nopinion of him; and his being so much attached to me--and his writing\\r\\nsuch a letter--but as to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon\\r\\nany consideration.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be\\r\\nparted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\\r\\nbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a \"very\\r\\ntrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\\r\\nmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\\r\\nher husband could write a good letter.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be\\r\\nalways happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse\\r\\nhim. But how shall I do? What shall I say?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and\\r\\nadvised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of\\r\\nher assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any\\r\\nassistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every\\r\\nsentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had\\r\\nsuch a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace\\r\\nher up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much\\r\\nconcerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of\\r\\nwhat his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious\\r\\nthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the\\r\\nyoung man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been\\r\\naccepted after all.</p>\\r\\n<p>This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The\\r\\nbusiness was finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the\\r\\nevening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes\\r\\nrelieved them by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing\\r\\nforward the idea of Mr. Elton.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,\" was said in rather a sorrowful tone.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.\\r\\nYou are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to\\r\\nAbbey-Mill.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but at Hartfield.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Some time afterwards it was, \"I think Mrs. Goddard would be very\\r\\nmuch surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash\\r\\nwould--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is\\r\\nonly a linen-draper.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the\\r\\nteacher of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such\\r\\nan opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would\\r\\nappear valuable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I\\r\\nsuppose she is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person\\r\\ncan hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy\\r\\nyou and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have\\r\\nexplained themselves.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\\r\\npeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\\r\\ncheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\\r\\nthe rejected Mr. Martin.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Now he has got my letter,\" said she softly. \"I wonder what they are\\r\\nall doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy, they will be\\r\\nunhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more\\r\\ncheerfully employed,\" cried Emma. \"At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton\\r\\nis shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much\\r\\nmore beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five or\\r\\nsix times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little\\r\\nmodest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street\\r\\ntill just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all\\r\\nthis evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his\\r\\nfamily, it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party\\r\\nthose pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\\r\\nprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\\r\\ntheir imaginations all are!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.</p>'", "id": 88, "section_id": 110},{"content": " '<p><br clear=\"&quot;all&quot;\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet slept at Hartfield that night.

And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take\\r\\nmy three turns--my winter walk.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You cannot do better, sir.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I\\r\\nam a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and,\\r\\nbesides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the sooner <i>you</i> go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\\r\\nimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more\\r\\nchat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more\\r\\nvoluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I cannot rate her beauty as you do,\" said he; \"but she is a pretty\\r\\nlittle creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\\r\\ndisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good\\r\\nhands she will turn out a valuable woman.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Come,\" said he, \"you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell\\r\\nyou that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl''s\\r\\ngiggle; she really does you credit.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had\\r\\nbeen of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where\\r\\nthey may. <i>You</i> do not often overpower me with it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she intended.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing. He presently added, with a smile,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you\\r\\nthat I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of\\r\\nsomething to her advantage.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Indeed! how so? of what sort?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A very serious sort, I assure you;\" still smiling.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love with her? Who makes you their confidant?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton''s having dropt a hint.\\r\\nMr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew\\r\\nMr. Elton looked up to him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have reason to think,\" he replied, \"that Harriet Smith will soon\\r\\nhave an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable\\r\\nquarter:--Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this\\r\\nsummer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love and\\r\\nmeans to marry her.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He is very obliging,\" said Emma; \"but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came\\r\\nto the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He\\r\\nknows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I\\r\\nbelieve, considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me\\r\\nwhether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;\\r\\nwhether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his\\r\\nchoice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being\\r\\nconsidered (especially since <i>your</i> making so much of her) as in\\r\\na line of society above him. I was very much pleased with all that he\\r\\nsaid. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He\\r\\nalways speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very well\\r\\njudging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and what\\r\\nthey all proposed doing in the event of his marriage. He is an\\r\\nexcellent young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation in\\r\\nadvising him to marry. He proved to me that he could afford it; and\\r\\nthat being the case, I was convinced he could not do better. I praised\\r\\nthe fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy. If he had\\r\\nnever esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of me\\r\\nthen; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and\\r\\ncounsellor man ever had. This happened the night before last. Now, as\\r\\nwe may fairly suppose, he would not allow much time to pass before he\\r\\nspoke to the lady, and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday,\\r\\nit is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard''s to-day; and she\\r\\nmay be detained by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome\\r\\nwretch.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Pray, Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\\r\\nthrough a great part of this speech, \"how do you know that Mr. Martin\\r\\ndid not speak yesterday?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it; but it may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Come,\" said she, \"I will tell you something, in return for what you\\r\\nhave told me. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was\\r\\nrefused.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\\r\\nKnightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he\\r\\nstood up, in tall indignation, and said,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the foolish girl about?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! to be sure,\" cried Emma, \"it is always incomprehensible to a\\r\\nman that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\\r\\nimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\\r\\nmeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\\r\\nso; but I hope you are mistaken.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your doing. You persuaded her to refuse him.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\\r\\nfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,\\r\\nbut I cannot admit him to be Harriet''s equal; and am rather surprized\\r\\nindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\\r\\ndoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\\r\\ngot over.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Not Harriet''s equal!\" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;\\r\\nand with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \"No, he is\\r\\nnot her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\\r\\nsituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\\r\\nHarriet Smith''s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\\r\\nconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\\r\\nnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\\r\\ncertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as\\r\\nparlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a\\r\\ngirl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too\\r\\nyoung and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she\\r\\ncan have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely\\r\\never to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good\\r\\ntempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on\\r\\nhis account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.\\r\\nI felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;\\r\\nand that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do\\r\\nworse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to\\r\\ntrust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of\\r\\ndisposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright\\r\\nand turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on\\r\\nher side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there\\r\\nwould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even <i>your</i>\\r\\nsatisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you\\r\\nwould not regret your friend''s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her\\r\\nbeing settled so well. I remember saying to myself, `Even Emma, with\\r\\nall her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.''\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\\r\\nany such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\\r\\nhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\\r\\nfriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man\\r\\nwhom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you\\r\\nshould think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you\\r\\nmine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.\\r\\nYou are not just to Harriet''s claims. They would be estimated very\\r\\ndifferently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest\\r\\nof the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\\r\\nsociety.--The sphere in which she moves is much above his.--It would be\\r\\na degradation.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she\\r\\nmay be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to\\r\\npay for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those\\r\\nwith whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her\\r\\nfather is a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is\\r\\nvery liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\\r\\ncomfort.--That she is a gentleman''s daughter, is indubitable to me;\\r\\nthat she associates with gentlemen''s daughters, no one, I apprehend,\\r\\nwill deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Whoever might be her parents,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"whoever may\\r\\nhave had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\\r\\ntheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\\r\\nAfter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard''s hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short, in Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard''s line, to have Mrs. Goddard''s acquaintance. Her friends\\r\\nevidently thought this good enough for her; and it <i>was</i> good\\r\\nenough. She desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her\\r\\ninto a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any\\r\\nambition beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in\\r\\nthe summer. She had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now,\\r\\nyou have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma.\\r\\nRobert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt\\r\\npersuaded of her not being disinclined to him. I know him well. He has\\r\\ntoo much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish\\r\\npassion. And as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I\\r\\nknow. Depend upon it he had encouragement.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\\r\\nassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\\r\\nagain.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,\\r\\nare unjust to Harriet. Harriet''s claims to marry well are not so\\r\\ncontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\\r\\nhas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have\\r\\nher understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point,\\r\\nhowever, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and\\r\\ngood-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,\\r\\nthey are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she\\r\\nis, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine\\r\\npeople out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more\\r\\nphilosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;\\r\\ntill they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome\\r\\nfaces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of\\r\\nbeing admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from\\r\\namong many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is\\r\\nnot so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough\\r\\nsweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a\\r\\ngreat readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much\\r\\nmistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such\\r\\ntemper, the highest claims a woman could possess.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is\\r\\nalmost enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than\\r\\nmisapply it as you do.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To be sure!\" cried she playfully. \"I know <i>that</i> is the\\r\\nfeeling of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what\\r\\nevery man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies\\r\\nhis judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever\\r\\nto marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just\\r\\nentering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at\\r\\nbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No--pray let\\r\\nher have time to look about her.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,\" said Mr.\\r\\nKnightley presently, \"though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I\\r\\nnow perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You\\r\\nwill puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has\\r\\na claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be\\r\\ngood enough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort\\r\\nof mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her\\r\\nexpectations too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of\\r\\nmarriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of\\r\\nsense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of\\r\\nfamily would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of\\r\\nsuch obscurity--and most prudent men would be afraid of the\\r\\ninconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery\\r\\nof her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and\\r\\nshe is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her\\r\\nto expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing\\r\\nless than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a\\r\\nparlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard''s all the rest of her life--or, at\\r\\nleast, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,)\\r\\ntill she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old\\r\\nwriting-master''s son.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that\\r\\nthere can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each\\r\\nother more angry. But as to my <i>letting</i> her marry Robert Martin,\\r\\nit is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as\\r\\nmust prevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of\\r\\nhaving refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I\\r\\nwill not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I\\r\\nassure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. His\\r\\nappearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she\\r\\never were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that\\r\\nbefore she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was\\r\\nthe brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and\\r\\naltogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great\\r\\nassistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him\\r\\ndisagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what gentlemen\\r\\nare; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance\\r\\nwith Harriet.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!\" cried Mr.\\r\\nKnightley.--\"Robert Martin''s manners have sense, sincerity, and\\r\\ngood-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility\\r\\nthan Harriet Smith could understand.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but\\r\\nwas really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.\\r\\nShe did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a\\r\\nbetter judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he\\r\\ncould be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment\\r\\nin general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and\\r\\nto have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very\\r\\ndisagreeable. Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only\\r\\none attempt on Emma''s side to talk of the weather, but he made no\\r\\nanswer. He was thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in\\r\\nthese words.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I hope\\r\\nit will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best\\r\\nknown to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of\\r\\nmatch-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects\\r\\nyou have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is\\r\\nthe man, I think it will be all labour in vain.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of\\r\\nman, and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to\\r\\nmake an imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as\\r\\nany body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He\\r\\nis as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with\\r\\nHarriet''s. He knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great\\r\\nfavourite wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in\\r\\nunreserved moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced\\r\\nthat he does not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak\\r\\nwith great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters\\r\\nare intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Emma, laughing again. \"If I\\r\\nhad set my heart on Mr. Elton''s marrying Harriet, it would have been\\r\\nvery kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet\\r\\nto myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\\r\\nequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good morning to you,\"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He\\r\\nwas very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and\\r\\nwas mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction\\r\\nhe had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the\\r\\naffair, was provoking him exceedingly.</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\\r\\nindistinctness in the causes of her''s, than in his. She did not always\\r\\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\\r\\nher opinions were right and her adversary''s wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He\\r\\nwalked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She\\r\\nwas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\\r\\nthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet''s\\r\\nstaying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility\\r\\nof the young man''s coming to Mrs. Goddard''s that morning, and meeting\\r\\nwith Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\\r\\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\\r\\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such\\r\\nreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\\r\\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\\r\\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which\\r\\nwoman''s friendship and woman''s feelings would not justify.</p>\\r\\n<p>He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she\\r\\nconsidered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had\\r\\ndone, neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell\\r\\nherself, in spite of Mr. Knightley''s pretensions) with the skill of\\r\\nsuch an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it\\r\\nhastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather said\\r\\nwhat he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing\\r\\nabout. He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more\\r\\nunreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not be of an\\r\\nimprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he might\\r\\nnaturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them; but then, Mr.\\r\\nKnightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong\\r\\npassion at war with all interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such\\r\\npassion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too\\r\\nmuch of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a\\r\\nreasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a\\r\\nreasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did not\\r\\nbelong to Mr. Elton.</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet''s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,\\r\\nnot to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had\\r\\nbeen telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\\r\\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard''s to attend a sick child,\\r\\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\\r\\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\\r\\nfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to\\r\\nLondon, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\\r\\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\\r\\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\\r\\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much\\r\\nto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\\r\\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a <i>very</i> <i>particular</i>\\r\\nway indeed, that he was going on business which he would not put off\\r\\nfor any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable\\r\\ncommission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious. Mr.\\r\\nPerry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must\\r\\nbe a <i>lady</i> in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only\\r\\nlooked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits. Miss\\r\\nNash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more about Mr.\\r\\nElton; and said, looking so very significantly at her, \"that she did\\r\\nnot pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only knew\\r\\nthat any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should think the\\r\\nluckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his\\r\\nequal for beauty or agreeableness.\"</p>'", "id": 89, "section_id": 111},{"content": " '<p><br clear=\"&quot;all&quot;\" />\\r\\nMr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with\\r\\nherself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual\\r\\nbefore he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave\\r\\nlooks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not\\r\\nrepent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more\\r\\njustified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next\\r\\nfew days.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.\\r\\nElton''s return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\\r\\nsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half\\r\\nsentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet''s\\r\\nfeelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and\\r\\nsteady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was\\r\\nsoon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin''s being no otherwise remembered,\\r\\nthan as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage\\r\\nto the latter.</p>\\r\\n<p>Her views of improving her little friend''s mind, by a great deal of\\r\\nuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few\\r\\nfirst chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much\\r\\neasier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination\\r\\nrange and work at Harriet''s fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge\\r\\nher comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary\\r\\npursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she\\r\\nwas making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing\\r\\nall the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin\\r\\nquarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with\\r\\nciphers and trophies.</p>\\r\\n<p>In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale\\r\\nare not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard''s, had\\r\\nwritten out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the\\r\\nfirst hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse''s help, to get a\\r\\ngreat many more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste;\\r\\nand as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an\\r\\narrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the\\r\\ngirls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting\\r\\nin. \"So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he\\r\\nwondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.\"\\r\\nAnd it always ended in \"Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,\\r\\ndid not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had\\r\\ndesired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,\\r\\nsomething, he thought, might come from that quarter.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was by no means his daughter''s wish that the intellects of\\r\\nHighbury in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the\\r\\nonly one whose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any\\r\\nreally good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect;\\r\\nand she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his\\r\\nrecollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most\\r\\nearnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe\\r\\na compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to him their\\r\\ntwo or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at\\r\\nlast he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known\\r\\ncharade,</p>\\r\\n<pre>   My first doth affliction denote,<br />     Which my second is destin''d to feel<br />   And my whole is the best antidote<br />     That affliction to soften and heal.--<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?\" said she;\\r\\n\"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be\\r\\neasier to you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in\\r\\nhis life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse\"--he stopt a moment--\"or Miss Smith could inspire him.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He\\r\\ncalled for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table\\r\\ncontaining, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed\\r\\nto a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his\\r\\nmanner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not offer it for Miss Smith''s collection,\" said he. \"Being my\\r\\nfriend''s, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,\\r\\nbut perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could\\r\\nunderstand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it\\r\\neasier to meet her eye than her friend''s. He was gone the next\\r\\nmoment:--after another moment''s pause,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Take it,\" said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards Harriet--\"it is for you. Take your own.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.</p>\\r\\n<pre>       To Miss--<br /></pre>\\r\\n<pre>         CHARADE.<br /></pre>\\r\\n<pre>   My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,<br />     Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.<br />   Another view of man, my second brings,<br />     Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!<br /></pre>\\r\\n<pre>   But ah! united, what reverse we have!<br />     Man''s boasted power and freedom, all are flown;<br />   Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,<br />     And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br /></pre>\\r\\n<pre>     Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,<br />     May its approval beam in that soft eye!<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it\\r\\nthrough again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and\\r\\nthen passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,\\r\\nwhile Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope\\r\\nand dulness, \"Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse\\r\\ncharades. <i>Courtship</i>--a very good hint. I give you credit for\\r\\nit. This is feeling your way. This is saying very plainly--`Pray, Miss\\r\\nSmith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and\\r\\nmy intentions in the same glance.''</p>\\r\\n<pre>     May its approval beam in that soft eye!<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets, the justest that could be given.</p>\\r\\n<pre>     Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>Humph--Harriet''s ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much\\r\\nin love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had\\r\\nthe benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your\\r\\nlife you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent\\r\\ncharade indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a\\r\\ncrisis soon now.</p>\\r\\n<p>She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\\r\\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the\\r\\neagerness of Harriet''s wondering questions.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an\\r\\nidea--I cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try\\r\\nto find it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so\\r\\nhard. Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the\\r\\nyoung lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?</p>\\r\\n<pre>     And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>Can it be Neptune?</p>\\r\\n<pre>     Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one\\r\\nsyllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you\\r\\nthinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made\\r\\nby a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.</p>\\r\\n<p>For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith.</p>\\r\\n<pre>   My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,<br />     Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>That is <i>court</i>.</p>\\r\\n<pre>   Another view of man, my second brings;<br />     Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>That is <i>ship</i>;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.</p>\\r\\n<pre>   But ah! united, (<i>courtship</i>, you know,) what reverse we have!<br />     Man''s boasted power and freedom, all are flown.<br />   Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,<br />     And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application, which I\\r\\nthink, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in\\r\\ncomprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of\\r\\nits being written for you and to you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read\\r\\nthe concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not\\r\\nspeak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.\\r\\nEmma spoke for her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this\\r\\ncompliment,\" said she, \"that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton''s\\r\\nintentions. You are his object--and you will soon receive the\\r\\ncompletest proof of it. I thought it must be so. I thought I could not\\r\\nbe so deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear\\r\\nand decided, as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew\\r\\nyou. Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very\\r\\ncircumstance to happen what has happened. I could never tell whether an\\r\\nattachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most\\r\\nnatural. Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled\\r\\neach other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with\\r\\nall my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride\\r\\nin creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. It will\\r\\ngive you every thing that you want--consideration, independence, a\\r\\nproper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends,\\r\\nclose to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This,\\r\\nHarriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dear Miss Woodhouse!\"--and \"Dear Miss Woodhouse,\" was all that\\r\\nHarriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when\\r\\nthey did arrive at something more like conversation, it was\\r\\nsufficiently clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and\\r\\nremembered just as she ought. Mr. Elton''s superiority had very ample\\r\\nacknowledgment.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Whatever you say is always right,\" cried Harriet, \"and therefore I\\r\\nsuppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not\\r\\nhave imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,\\r\\nwho might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about <i>him</i>.\\r\\nHe is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--`To Miss\\r\\n--------.'' Dear me, how clever!--Could it really be meant for me?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is\\r\\na certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the\\r\\nplay, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by\\r\\nmatter-of-fact prose.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure,\\r\\na month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take\\r\\nplace!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and\\r\\nreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so\\r\\nevidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement of\\r\\nother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\\r\\nYou and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one\\r\\nanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying\\r\\nwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a\\r\\nsomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right\\r\\ndirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.</p>\\r\\n<pre>     The course of true love never did run smooth--<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all\\r\\npeople, who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,\\r\\nthe very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks\\r\\nup to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that\\r\\nevery body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not\\r\\nchuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week.\\r\\nAnd so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he\\r\\nhas ever preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look\\r\\nback to the first time I saw him! How little did I think!--The two\\r\\nAbbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when\\r\\nwe heard he was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and\\r\\nstaid to look through herself; however, she called me back presently,\\r\\nand let me look too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we\\r\\nthought he looked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be,\\r\\nmust be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense;\\r\\nand we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are\\r\\nanxious to see you <i>happily</i> married, here is a man whose amiable\\r\\ncharacter gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you\\r\\nsettled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place\\r\\nyou in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only object is that\\r\\nyou should, in the common phrase, be <i>well</i> married, here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You\\r\\nunderstand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the\\r\\nother. This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never\\r\\nhave made any thing like it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it yesterday.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is as long again as almost all we have had before.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things in general cannot be too short.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is one thing,\" said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--\"to\\r\\nhave very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if\\r\\nthere is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just\\r\\nwhat you must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and\\r\\ncharades like this.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin''s prose.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Such sweet lines!\" continued Harriet--\"these two last!--But how\\r\\nshall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found it\\r\\nout?--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I\\r\\ndare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other\\r\\nwill pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes\\r\\nshall chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this\\r\\nbeautiful charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so\\r\\ngood.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! but those two lines are\"--</p>\\r\\n<p>--\"The best of all. Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private\\r\\nenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\\r\\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\\r\\nmeaning change. But take it away, and all <i>appropriation</i> ceases,\\r\\nand a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection.\\r\\nDepend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much\\r\\nbetter than his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both\\r\\ncapacities, or neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and\\r\\nthen there can be no possible reflection on you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,\\r\\nso as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\\r\\ndeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\\r\\nof publicity.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\" said she.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Very well,\" replied Emma; \"a most natural feeling; and the longer\\r\\nit lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming:\\r\\nyou will not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving\\r\\nhim so much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially\\r\\nany thing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\\r\\ngallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet looked grave.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this\\r\\ncharade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too\\r\\nconscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even\\r\\nquite all the meaning which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered\\r\\nby such a little tribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for\\r\\nsecrecy, he would not have left the paper while I was by; but he rather\\r\\npushed it towards me than towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on\\r\\nthe business. He has encouragement enough to proceed, without our\\r\\nsighing out our souls over this charade.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by\\r\\nthe recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \"Well, my dears, how\\r\\ndoes your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\\r\\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt, we suppose,\\r\\nby a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\\r\\nit in.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly\\r\\nand distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\\r\\npart as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\\r\\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Aye, that''s very just, indeed, that''s very properly said. Very\\r\\ntrue. `Woman, lovely woman.'' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that\\r\\nI can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so\\r\\nprettily, but you, Emma.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very tender sigh, he added,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\\r\\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\\r\\nremember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have heard\\r\\nme mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\\r\\nseveral.</p>\\r\\n<pre>   Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,<br />     Kindled a flame I yet deplore,<br />   The hood-wink''d boy I called to aid,<br />   Though of his near approach afraid,<br />     So fatal to my suit before.<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever\\r\\nall the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick''s, you know.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.</p>\\r\\n<pre>   Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.<br /></pre>\\r\\n<p>The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near\\r\\nbeing christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have\\r\\nher here next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put\\r\\nher--and what room there will be for the children?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\\r\\nhas;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual, you\\r\\nknow. Why should there be any change?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not\\r\\nsince last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley''s\\r\\nbeing a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly\\r\\ntaken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes, not\\r\\nto see Miss Taylor here!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She will not be surprized, papa, at least.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is here.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed\\r\\ntone)--she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for any\\r\\nthing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case\\r\\nof necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and\\r\\nwe ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the\\r\\ntime they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be\\r\\ntaken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim\\r\\nthis Christmas--though you know it is longer since they were with him,\\r\\nthan with us.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley''s claims on his\\r\\nbrother, or any body''s claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat\\r\\nmusing a little while, and then said,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\\r\\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\\r\\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and\\r\\nI do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\\r\\nhusband.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his\\r\\nspirits affected by the idea of his daughter''s attachment to her\\r\\nhusband, she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must\\r\\nraise them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my\\r\\nbrother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the\\r\\nchildren. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder\\r\\nwhich she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will\\r\\nbe to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\\r\\neldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,\\r\\nis named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\\r\\nthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\\r\\nthought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\\r\\nare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\\r\\ncome and stand by my chair, and say, `Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\\r\\nof string?'' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\\r\\nwere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with\\r\\nthem very often.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He appears rough to you,\" said Emma, \"because you are so very\\r\\ngentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you\\r\\nwould not think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy;\\r\\nand if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he\\r\\nis an affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley is an\\r\\naffectionate father. The children are all fond of him.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is\\r\\nsuch enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule\\r\\nof their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the\\r\\nother.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well, I cannot understand it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate\\r\\nin preparation for the regular four o''clock dinner, the hero of this\\r\\ninimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\\r\\nreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\\r\\nhis the consciousness of having made a push--of having thrown a die;\\r\\nand she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His\\r\\nostensible reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse''s party\\r\\ncould be made up in the evening without him, or whether he should be in\\r\\nthe smallest degree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing\\r\\nelse must give way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so\\r\\nmuch about his dining with him--had made such a point of it, that he\\r\\nhad promised him conditionally to come.</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his\\r\\nfriend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He\\r\\nre-urged--she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow,\\r\\nwhen taking the paper from the table, she returned it--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;\\r\\nthank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have\\r\\nventured to write it into Miss Smith''s collection. Your friend will not\\r\\ntake it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first\\r\\neight lines.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked\\r\\nrather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about\\r\\n\"honour,\"--glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book\\r\\nopen on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With\\r\\nthe view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade\\r\\nmust not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman''s\\r\\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have no hesitation in saying,\" replied Mr. Elton, though\\r\\nhesitating a good deal while he spoke; \"I have no hesitation in\\r\\nsaying--at least if my friend feels at all as <i>I</i> do--I have not the smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as <i>I</i> see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not\\r\\nthink it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there\\r\\nwas a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her\\r\\nto laugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender\\r\\nand the sublime of pleasure to Harriet''s share.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'", "id": 90, "section_id": 112},{"content": " '<p><br clear=\"&quot;all&quot;\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\\r\\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\\r\\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\\r\\nlived a little way out of Highbury.</p>\\r\\n<p>Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\\r\\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street\\r\\nof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of\\r\\nMr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,\\r\\nabout a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and\\r\\nnot very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\\r\\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\\r\\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\\r\\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\\r\\neyes.--Emma''s remark was--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.\"-- Harriet''s was--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not often walk this way <i>now</i>,\" said Emma, as they proceeded, \"but <i>then</i>\\r\\nthere will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately\\r\\nacquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part\\r\\nof Highbury.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the\\r\\nVicarage, and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering\\r\\nexteriors and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of\\r\\nlove, with Mr. Elton''s seeing ready wit in her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I wish we could contrive it,\" said she; \"but I cannot think of any\\r\\ntolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquire\\r\\nabout of his housekeeper--no message from my father.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some minutes, Harriet thus began again--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going to be married! so charming as you are!\"--</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma laughed, and replied,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to\\r\\nmarry; I must find other people charming--one other person at least.\\r\\nAnd I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very\\r\\nlittle intention of ever marrying at all.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\\r\\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\\r\\nquestion: and I do <i>not</i> wish to see any such person. I would\\r\\nrather not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were\\r\\nto marry, I must expect to repent it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\"--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to\\r\\nfall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have\\r\\nbeen in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever\\r\\nshall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\\r\\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\\r\\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\\r\\nmistress of their husband''s house as I am of Hartfield; and never,\\r\\nnever could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always\\r\\nfirst and always right in any man''s eyes as I am in my father''s.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and\\r\\nif I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--\\r\\nso smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious-- and so\\r\\napt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\\r\\nto-morrow. But between <i>us</i>, I am convinced there never can be any likeness, except in being unmarried.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that''s so dreadful!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is\\r\\npoverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A\\r\\nsingle woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,\\r\\ndisagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single\\r\\nwoman, of good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible\\r\\nand pleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much\\r\\nagainst the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;\\r\\nfor a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour\\r\\nthe temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very\\r\\nsmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and\\r\\ncross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too\\r\\ngood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\\r\\nmuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty\\r\\ncertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had\\r\\nonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away\\r\\nsixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you grow old?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a\\r\\ngreat many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be\\r\\nmore in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.\\r\\nWoman''s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then\\r\\nas they are now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I\\r\\nshall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And\\r\\nas for objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in\\r\\ntruth the great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the\\r\\ngreat evil to be avoided in <i>not</i> marrying, I shall be very well\\r\\noff, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about.\\r\\nThere will be enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort\\r\\nof sensation that declining life can need. There will be enough for\\r\\nevery hope and every fear; and though my attachment to none can equal\\r\\nthat of a parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is\\r\\nwarmer and blinder. My nephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece\\r\\nwith me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Do you know Miss Bates''s niece? That is, I know you must have seen her a hundred times--but are you acquainted?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury. By the bye, <i>that</i>\\r\\nis almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece. Heaven forbid!\\r\\nat least, that I should ever bore people half so much about all the\\r\\nKnightleys together, as she does about Jane Fairfax. One is sick of the\\r\\nvery name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from her is read forty times\\r\\nover; her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if\\r\\nshe does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair\\r\\nof garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.\\r\\nI wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\\r\\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\\r\\nwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\\r\\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\\r\\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\\r\\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\\r\\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\\r\\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\\r\\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\\r\\ncame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\\r\\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\\r\\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they\\r\\nmake every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of\\r\\nnothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who\\r\\ncan say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Very true,\" said Harriet. \"Poor creatures! one can think of nothing else.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,\" said\\r\\nEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\\r\\nthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\\r\\ninto the lane again. \"I do not think it will,\" stopping to look once\\r\\nmore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\\r\\ngreater within.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! dear, no,\" said her companion.</p>\\r\\n<p>They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was\\r\\npassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma\\r\\ntime only to say farther,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in\\r\\ngood thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if\\r\\ncompassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has\\r\\ndone all that is truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough\\r\\nto do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing\\r\\nto ourselves.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet could just answer, \"Oh! dear, yes,\" before the gentleman\\r\\njoined them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were\\r\\nthe first subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His\\r\\nvisit he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about\\r\\nwhat could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to\\r\\naccompany them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\" thought\\r\\nEmma; \"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase\\r\\nof love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\\r\\ndeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\\r\\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\\r\\nside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had\\r\\nnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet''s habits of\\r\\ndependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\\r\\nthey would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\\r\\nstopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\\r\\nof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\\r\\nfootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\\r\\nfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time\\r\\nshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the\\r\\ncomfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from\\r\\nthe cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to\\r\\nfetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk\\r\\nto and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would\\r\\nhave been the most natural, had she been acting just then without\\r\\ndesign; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,\\r\\nwithout any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\\r\\ninvoluntarily: the child''s pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and\\r\\nshe was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a\\r\\nconversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\\r\\nanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\\r\\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw\\r\\nback a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged\\r\\nto join them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting\\r\\ndetail; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he\\r\\nwas only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday''s party\\r\\nat his friend Cole''s, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton\\r\\ncheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery, the beet-root,\\r\\nand all the dessert.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"This would soon have led to something better, of course,\" was her\\r\\nconsoling reflection; \"any thing interests between those who love; and\\r\\nany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\\r\\ncould but have kept longer away!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the\\r\\nvicarage pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet\\r\\ninto the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her\\r\\nboot, and fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace\\r\\noff short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently\\r\\nobliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put\\r\\nherself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Part of my lace is gone,\" said she, \"and I do not know how I am to\\r\\ncontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\\r\\nhope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to\\r\\nstop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or\\r\\nstring, or any thing just to keep my boot on.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing\\r\\ncould exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his\\r\\nhouse and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The\\r\\nroom they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking\\r\\nforwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated;\\r\\nthe door between them was open, and Emma passed into it with the\\r\\nhousekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner.\\r\\nShe was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully\\r\\nintended that Mr. Elton should close it. It was not closed, however, it\\r\\nstill remained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant\\r\\nconversation, she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own\\r\\nsubject in the adjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing\\r\\nbut herself. It could be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to\\r\\nbe finished, and make her appearance.</p>\\r\\n<p>The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a\\r\\nmost favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of\\r\\nhaving schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to\\r\\nthe point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told\\r\\nHarriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;\\r\\nother little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing\\r\\nserious.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Cautious, very cautious,\" thought Emma; \"he advances inch by inch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\\r\\ningenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\\r\\nthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading\\r\\nthem forward to the great event.</p>'", "id": 91, "section_id": 113},{"content": " '<p><br clear=\"&quot;all&quot;\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma''s\\r\\npower to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming\\r\\nof her sister''s family was so very near at hand, that first in\\r\\nanticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime\\r\\nobject of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield\\r\\nit was not to be expected--she did not herself expect-- that any thing\\r\\nbeyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to\\r\\nthe lovers. They might advance rapidly if they would, however; they\\r\\nmust advance somehow or other whether they would or no. She hardly\\r\\nwished to have more leisure for them. There are people, who the more\\r\\nyou do for them, the less they will do for themselves.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual\\r\\nabsent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual\\r\\ninterest. Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had\\r\\nbeen divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays\\r\\nof this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it\\r\\nwas therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by\\r\\ntheir Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not\\r\\nbe induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella''s sake; and\\r\\nwho consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in\\r\\nforestalling this too short visit.</p>\\r\\n<p>He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a\\r\\nlittle of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring\\r\\nsome of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were\\r\\nneedless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of\\r\\nnursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of\\r\\nsuch an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and\\r\\nvariously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion\\r\\nwhich his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have\\r\\nendured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the\\r\\nfeelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that\\r\\nin spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her\\r\\nlittle ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and\\r\\nattendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,\\r\\nwhich they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the\\r\\nchildren were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in\\r\\nthemselves or in any restless attendance on them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,\\r\\nquiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;\\r\\nwrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so\\r\\ntenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher\\r\\nties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a\\r\\nfault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or\\r\\nany quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited\\r\\nalso much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health,\\r\\nover-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves,\\r\\nand was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be\\r\\nof Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper,\\r\\nand a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\\r\\nrising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private\\r\\ncharacter; but with reserved manners which prevented his being\\r\\ngenerally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He\\r\\nwas not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to\\r\\ndeserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection;\\r\\nand, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that\\r\\nany natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme\\r\\nsweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness and\\r\\nquickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an\\r\\nungracious, or say a severe thing.</p>\\r\\n<p>He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing\\r\\nwrong in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries\\r\\nto Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have\\r\\npassed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella''s sister,\\r\\nbut they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\\r\\npraise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\\r\\ncompliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all\\r\\nin her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\\r\\nforbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\\r\\nthat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse''s peculiarities and\\r\\nfidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\\r\\nsharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr.\\r\\nJohn Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and\\r\\ngenerally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often\\r\\nfor Emma''s charity, especially as there was all the pain of\\r\\napprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The\\r\\nbeginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest\\r\\nfeelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass\\r\\naway in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and\\r\\ncomposed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a\\r\\nsigh, called his daughter''s attention to the sad change at Hartfield\\r\\nsince she had been there last.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah, my dear,\" said he, \"poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh yes, sir,\" cried she with ready sympathy, \"how you must miss\\r\\nher! And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!-- I have\\r\\nbeen so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do\\r\\nwithout her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty\\r\\nwell, sir.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my\\r\\nlife-- never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Very much to the honour of both,\" was the handsome reply.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\" asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--\"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\\r\\nmarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,\\r\\nhave we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,\\r\\neither at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, most\\r\\nfrequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston\\r\\nis really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy\\r\\nway, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body\\r\\nmust be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought\\r\\nalso to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our\\r\\nmissing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which\\r\\nis the exact truth.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Just as it should be,\" said Mr. John Knightley, \"and just as I\\r\\nhoped it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could\\r\\nnot be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all\\r\\neasy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of\\r\\nthe change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and\\r\\nnow you have Emma''s account, I hope you will be satisfied.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why, to be sure,\" said Mr. Woodhouse--\"yes, certainly--I cannot\\r\\ndeny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\\r\\noften-- but then--she is always obliged to go away again.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.-- You quite forget poor Mr. Weston.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I think, indeed,\" said John Knightley pleasantly, \"that Mr. Weston\\r\\nhas some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part\\r\\nof the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the\\r\\nclaims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for\\r\\nIsabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of\\r\\nputting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Me, my love,\" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in\\r\\npart.-- \"Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or\\r\\ncan be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not\\r\\nbeen for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have\\r\\nthought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;\\r\\nand as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think\\r\\nthere is nothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very\\r\\nbest-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your\\r\\nbrother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his\\r\\nflying Henry''s kite for him that very windy day last Easter--and ever\\r\\nsince his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing\\r\\nthat note, at twelve o''clock at night, on purpose to assure me that\\r\\nthere was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could\\r\\nnot be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any body\\r\\ncan deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Where is the young man?\" said John Knightley. \"Has he been here on this occasion--or has he not?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He has not been here yet,\" replied Emma. \"There was a strong\\r\\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\\r\\nnothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\" said her father.\\r\\n\"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\\r\\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\\r\\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\\r\\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought\\r\\nit-- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well,\\r\\ntime does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, it was an\\r\\nexceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great\\r\\ndeal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated\\r\\nSept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,'' but I forget how it went on;\\r\\nand it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.''-- I remember that\\r\\nperfectly.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How very pleasing and proper of him!\" cried the good-hearted Mrs.\\r\\nJohn Knightley. \"I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man.\\r\\nBut how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!\\r\\nThere is something so shocking in a child''s being taken away from his\\r\\nparents and natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could\\r\\npart with him. To give up one''s child! I really never could think well\\r\\nof any body who proposed such a thing to any body else.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\" observed\\r\\nMr. John Knightley coolly. \"But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have\\r\\nfelt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is\\r\\nrather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;\\r\\nhe takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow\\r\\nor other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society\\r\\nfor his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and\\r\\nplaying whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family\\r\\naffection, or any thing that home affords.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and\\r\\nhad half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She\\r\\nwould keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable\\r\\nand valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home\\r\\nto himself, whence resulted her brother''s disposition to look down on\\r\\nthe common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was\\r\\nimportant.--It had a high claim to forbearance.</p>'", "id": 92, "section_id": 114},{"content": " '<p><br clear=\"&quot;all&quot;\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination\\r\\nof Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him\\r\\nin Isabella''s first day. Emma''s sense of right however had decided it;\\r\\nand besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\\r\\nparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement\\r\\nbetween Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper\\r\\ninvitation.</p>\\r\\n<p>She hoped they might now become friends again.

Concession must be out of the question;\\r\\nbut it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and\\r\\nshe hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship, that\\r\\nwhen he came into the room she had one of the children with her--the\\r\\nyoungest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who was now making\\r\\nher first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced about in her\\r\\naunt''s arms. It did assist; for though he began with grave looks and\\r\\nshort questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual\\r\\nway, and to take the child out of her arms with all the\\r\\nunceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again;\\r\\nand the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then a\\r\\nlittle sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the\\r\\nbaby,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and\\r\\nnieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;\\r\\nbut with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and\\r\\nwomen, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings\\r\\nwith them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might\\r\\nalways think alike.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" said he, smiling--\"and reason good. I was sixteen years old when you were born.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A material difference then,\" she replied--\"and no doubt you were\\r\\nmuch my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not\\r\\nthe lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\\r\\nnearer?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes--a good deal <i>nearer</i>.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we think differently.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years'' experience, and\\r\\nby not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear\\r\\nEmma, let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt,\\r\\nlittle Emma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be\\r\\nrenewing old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is\\r\\nnow.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That''s true,\" she cried--\"very true. Little Emma, grow up a better\\r\\nwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.\\r\\nNow, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good\\r\\nintentions went, we were <i>both</i> right, and I must say that no\\r\\neffects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want\\r\\nto know that Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A man cannot be more so,\" was his short, full answer.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John\\r\\nKnightley made his appearance, and \"How d''ye do, George?\" and \"John,\\r\\nhow are you?\" succeeded in the true English style, burying under a\\r\\ncalmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which\\r\\nwould have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the\\r\\ngood of the other.</p>\\r\\n<p>The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined\\r\\ncards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella,\\r\\nand the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his\\r\\ndaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally\\r\\ndistinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally joining in\\r\\none or the other.</p>\\r\\n<p>The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but\\r\\nprincipally of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most\\r\\ncommunicative, and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate,\\r\\nhe had generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,\\r\\nsome curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the\\r\\nhome-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next\\r\\nyear, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being\\r\\ninteresting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest\\r\\npart of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a\\r\\ndrain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the\\r\\ndestination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was\\r\\nentered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his cooler\\r\\nmanners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any\\r\\nthing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of\\r\\neagerness.</p>\\r\\n<p>While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was\\r\\nenjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his\\r\\ndaughter.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My poor dear Isabella,\" said he, fondly taking her hand, and\\r\\ninterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\\r\\nfive children--\"How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\\r\\nAnd how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,\\r\\nmy dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and\\r\\nI will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we\\r\\nall have a little gruel.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both\\r\\nthe Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as\\r\\nherself;--and two basins only were ordered. After a little more\\r\\ndiscourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being\\r\\ntaken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air of\\r\\ngrave reflection,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at\\r\\nSouth End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea\\r\\nair.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we should\\r\\nnot have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly\\r\\nfor the weakness in little Bella''s throat,-- both sea air and bathing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any\\r\\ngood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though\\r\\nperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use\\r\\nto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Come, come,\" cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, \"I\\r\\nmust beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and\\r\\nmiserable;-- I who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you\\r\\nplease. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about\\r\\nMr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he\\r\\nhas not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has not time to\\r\\ntake care of himself--which is very sad--but he is always wanted all\\r\\nround the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice\\r\\nanywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children\\r\\ngrow? I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling\\r\\nsoon. He will be so pleased to see my little ones.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to\\r\\nask him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he\\r\\ncomes, you had better let him look at little Bella''s throat.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly\\r\\nany uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest\\r\\nservice to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent\\r\\nembrocation of Mr. Wingfield''s, which we have been applying at times\\r\\never since August.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of\\r\\nuse to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would\\r\\nhave spoken to--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\" said Emma, \"I have not heard one inquiry after them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you mention\\r\\nthem in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\\r\\nBates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.--They are\\r\\nalways so pleased to see my children.-- And that excellent Miss\\r\\nBates!--such thorough worthy people!-- How are they, sir?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\\r\\nthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\\r\\ngeneral or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree\\r\\nyou mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so\\r\\nheavy as he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call\\r\\nit altogether a sickly season.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it <i>very</i> sickly except--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a\\r\\nsickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\\r\\ndreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!-- and the\\r\\nair so bad!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, indeed--<i>we</i> are not at all in a bad air. Our part of\\r\\nLondon is very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with\\r\\nLondon in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square\\r\\nis very different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I\\r\\nshould be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--\\r\\nthere is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children\\r\\nin: but <i>we</i> are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it--\\r\\nbut after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you\\r\\ndifferent creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say,\\r\\nthat I think you are any of you looking well at present.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting\\r\\nthose little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never\\r\\nentirely free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the\\r\\nchildren were rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because\\r\\nthey were a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the\\r\\nhappiness of coming. I hope you will think better of their looks\\r\\nto-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not\\r\\nbelieve he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust,\\r\\nat least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,\" turning her\\r\\neyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?\" cried Mr. John Knightley, hearing his own name.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you\\r\\nlooking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I\\r\\ncould have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr.\\r\\nWingfield before you left home.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My dear Isabella,\"--exclaimed he hastily--\"pray do not concern\\r\\nyourself about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling\\r\\nyourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your\\r\\nbrother,\" cried Emma, \"about your friend Mr. Graham''s intending to have\\r\\na bailiff from Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it\\r\\nanswer? Will not the old prejudice be too strong?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when\\r\\nforced to give her attention again to her father and sister, she had\\r\\nnothing worse to hear than Isabella''s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax;\\r\\nand Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she\\r\\nwas at that moment very happy to assist in praising.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\" said Mrs. John Knightley.-- \"It\\r\\nis so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\\r\\naccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\\r\\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\\r\\nregret excessively on dear Emma''s account that she cannot be more at\\r\\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\\r\\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\\r\\ndelightful companion for Emma.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another\\r\\npretty kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have\\r\\na better companion than Harriet.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma''s age.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of\\r\\nsimilar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening\\r\\ndid not close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and\\r\\nsupplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--\\r\\nundoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and\\r\\npretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met\\r\\nwith tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which the\\r\\ndaughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most\\r\\nprominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman hired for\\r\\nthe time, who never had been able to understand what she meant by a\\r\\nbasin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had\\r\\nwished for and ordered it, she had never been able to get any thing\\r\\ntolerable. Here was a dangerous opening.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah!\" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on\\r\\nher with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma''s ear expressed, \"Ah!\\r\\nthere is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\\r\\ndoes not bear talking of.\" And for a little while she hoped he would\\r\\nnot talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore\\r\\nhim to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some\\r\\nminutes, however, he began with,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn, instead of coming here.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children a great deal of good.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have\\r\\nbeen to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized\\r\\nto hear you had fixed upon South End.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is\\r\\nquite a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there,\\r\\nnever found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield\\r\\nsays it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am\\r\\nsure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of\\r\\nthe air, and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--\\r\\nPerry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all\\r\\nthe sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air.\\r\\nAnd, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away\\r\\nfrom the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should\\r\\nhave consulted Perry.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how\\r\\ngreat it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\\r\\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\\r\\nchuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,\\r\\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a\\r\\nworse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\\r\\nill-judged measure.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma''s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had\\r\\nreached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\\r\\nbrother-in-law''s breaking out.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mr. Perry,\" said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, \"would\\r\\ndo as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make\\r\\nit any business of his, to wonder at what I do?-- at my taking my\\r\\nfamily to one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope,\\r\\nthe use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.-- I want his directions no\\r\\nmore than his drugs.\" He paused-- and growing cooler in a moment,\\r\\nadded, with only sarcastic dryness, \"If Mr. Perry can tell me how to\\r\\nconvey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty\\r\\nmiles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of\\r\\nforty, I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could\\r\\nhimself.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"True, true,\" cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--\\r\\n\"very true. That''s a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I was\\r\\ntelling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it\\r\\nmore to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows, I\\r\\ncannot conceive any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to\\r\\nbe the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call\\r\\nto mind exactly the present line of the path. . . . The only way of\\r\\nproving it, however, will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at\\r\\nthe Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we will look them over,\\r\\nand you shall give me your opinion.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his\\r\\nfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been\\r\\nattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but the\\r\\nsoothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present\\r\\nevil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better\\r\\nrecollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.</p>'", "id": 93, "section_id": 115},{"content": " '<p><br clear=\"&quot;all&quot;\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John\\r\\nKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\\r\\namong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over\\r\\nwhat she had done every evening with her father and sister. She had\\r\\nnothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly.\\r\\nIt was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.</p>\\r\\n<p>In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their\\r\\nmornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,\\r\\nthere was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no\\r\\ndenial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was\\r\\npersuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of\\r\\nthe party.</p>\\r\\n<p>How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if\\r\\nhe could, but as his son and daughter''s carriage and horses were\\r\\nactually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple\\r\\nquestion on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy\\r\\nEmma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find\\r\\nroom for Harriet also.</p>\\r\\n<p>Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were\\r\\nthe only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, as\\r\\nwell as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse''s habits and inclination being\\r\\nconsulted in every thing.</p>\\r\\n<p>The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event\\r\\nthat Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been\\r\\nspent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed\\r\\nwith a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma\\r\\ncalled on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with\\r\\nregard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat:\\r\\nMrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of,\\r\\nand Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which\\r\\nexcluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not\\r\\nspeak of her loss without many tears.</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs.\\r\\nGoddard''s unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing\\r\\nhow much Mr. Elton''s would be depressed when he knew her state; and\\r\\nleft her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his\\r\\nhaving a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very\\r\\nmuch. She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard''s door, when\\r\\nshe was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as\\r\\nthey walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid-- of\\r\\nwhom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going to\\r\\ninquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield-- they\\r\\nwere overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to\\r\\nDonwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed\\r\\nall the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch\\r\\nof the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for. They\\r\\njoined company and proceeded together. Emma was just describing the\\r\\nnature of her friend''s complaint;-- \"a throat very much inflamed, with\\r\\na great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &amp;c. and she was\\r\\nsorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad\\r\\nsore-throats, and had often alarmed her with them.\" Mr. Elton looked\\r\\nall alarm on the occasion, as he exclaimed,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\\r\\ninfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\\r\\nyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\\r\\nWhy does not Perry see her?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised\\r\\nthis excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard''s experience\\r\\nand care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which\\r\\nshe could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and\\r\\nassist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much like\\r\\nsnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\\r\\nshould really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father from\\r\\nventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel\\r\\nthe cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so\\r\\ngreat a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.\\r\\nElton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me\\r\\na little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\\r\\nwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\\r\\ncommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to\\r\\nmake; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the\\r\\nkind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of\\r\\nher''s, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--\\r\\nbut Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views\\r\\nto hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well\\r\\nsatisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being \"very cold,\\r\\ncertainly very cold,\" and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him\\r\\nfrom Randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after\\r\\nHarriet every hour of the evening.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You do quite right,\" said she;--\"we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\\r\\noffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton''s only\\r\\nobjection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt\\r\\nsatisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had\\r\\nhis broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;\\r\\nnever had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when\\r\\nhe next looked at her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well,\" said she to herself, \"this is most strange!--After I had got\\r\\nhim off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill\\r\\nbehind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men,\\r\\nespecially single men, such an inclination-- such a passion for dining\\r\\nout--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\\r\\ntheir employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing\\r\\ngives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\\r\\nvaluable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in\\r\\nlove with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must\\r\\ndine out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see\\r\\nready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\\r\\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his\\r\\nmanner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while\\r\\nassuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard''s for news of her fair\\r\\nfriend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting\\r\\nher again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he\\r\\nsighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of\\r\\napprobation much in his favour.</p>\\r\\n<p>After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began with--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than\\r\\nMr. Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.\\r\\nWith men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to\\r\\nplease, every feature works.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mr. Elton''s manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where\\r\\nthere is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook\\r\\na great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he\\r\\nwill have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such\\r\\nperfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, \"he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton''s object?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\\r\\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it\\r\\nis so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\\r\\nmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\\r\\nlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and\\r\\nI are very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on, amusing\\r\\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\\r\\npartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of\\r\\nhigh pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very\\r\\nwell pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and\\r\\nin want of counsel. He said no more.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that\\r\\nin spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of\\r\\nshrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his\\r\\neldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness\\r\\nof the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his\\r\\nown going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it\\r\\nwas cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was\\r\\nsevere; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes\\r\\nof snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of\\r\\nbeing so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very\\r\\nwhite world in a very short time.</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\\r\\npreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\\r\\nhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\\r\\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\\r\\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\\r\\nwhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\\r\\ndiscontent.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A man,\" said he, \"must have a very good opinion of himself when he\\r\\nasks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\\r\\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\\r\\nagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\\r\\nabsurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!-- The folly of not allowing\\r\\npeople to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people''s not staying\\r\\ncomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an\\r\\nevening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\\r\\nshould deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\\r\\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\\r\\nthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\\r\\nor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\\r\\nthat he can;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\\r\\nanother man''s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\\r\\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\\r\\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses and\\r\\nfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\\r\\ncreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\\r\\nat home.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no\\r\\ndoubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the \"Very true, my\\r\\nlove,\" which must have been usually administered by his travelling\\r\\ncompanion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any\\r\\nanswer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being\\r\\nquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\\r\\ntalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\\r\\nher lips.</p>\\r\\n<p>They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr.\\r\\nElton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma\\r\\nthought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all\\r\\nobligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities\\r\\nindeed, that she began to think he must have received a different\\r\\naccount of Harriet from what had reached her. She had sent while\\r\\ndressing, and the answer had been, \"Much the same-- not better.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>My</i> report from Mrs. Goddard''s,\" said she presently, \"was not so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better'' was <i>my</i> answer.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you\\r\\nthat when I called at Mrs. Goddard''s door, which I did the very last\\r\\nthing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not\\r\\nbetter, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and\\r\\nconcerned-- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a\\r\\ncordial as I knew had been given her in the morning.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma smiled and answered--\"My visit was of use to the nervous part\\r\\nof her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;\\r\\nit is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\\r\\nprobably heard.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\\r\\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\\r\\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\\r\\nestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\\r\\nwhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\\r\\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What an excellent device,\" said he, \"the use of a sheepskin for\\r\\ncarriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold\\r\\nwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\\r\\nrendered a gentleman''s carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\\r\\nand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\\r\\nunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\\r\\ncold afternoon--but in this carriage we know nothing of the\\r\\nmatter.--Ha! snows a little I see.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" said John Knightley, \"and I think we shall have a good deal of it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Christmas weather,\" observed Mr. Elton. \"Quite seasonable; and\\r\\nextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\\r\\nyesterday, and prevent this day''s party, which it might very possibly\\r\\nhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\\r\\nmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\\r\\nthe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body\\r\\ninvites their friends about them, and people think little of even the\\r\\nworst weather. I was snowed up at a friend''s house once for a week.\\r\\nNothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not\\r\\nget away till that very day se''nnight.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\\r\\nastonished now at Mr. Elton''s spirits for other feelings. Harriet\\r\\nseemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We are sure of excellent fires,\" continued he, \"and every thing in\\r\\nthe greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;-- Mrs.\\r\\nWeston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values,\\r\\nso hospitable, and so fond of society;-- it will be a small party, but\\r\\nwhere small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of\\r\\nany. Mr. Weston''s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten\\r\\ncomfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,\\r\\nfall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me,\\r\\n(turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your\\r\\napprobation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large\\r\\nparties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine with any body.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law\\r\\nhad been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you\\r\\nwill be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great\\r\\nenjoyment.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My first enjoyment,\" replied John Knightley, as they passed through\\r\\nthe sweep-gate, \"will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.\"</p>'", "id": 94, "section_id": 116},{"content": " '<p>Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they\\r\\nwalked into Mrs. Weston''s drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose his\\r\\njoyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton\\r\\nmust smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\\r\\nplace.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\\r\\nhappy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\\r\\nMr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\\r\\nworld to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\\r\\none, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and\\r\\nunderstood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\\r\\nlittle affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\\r\\nand herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\\r\\nhad not a lively concern; and half an hour''s uninterrupted\\r\\ncommunication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness\\r\\nof private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.</p>\\r\\n<p>This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day''s visit might not\\r\\nafford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but\\r\\nthe very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was\\r\\ngrateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of\\r\\nMr. Elton''s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all\\r\\nthat was enjoyable to the utmost.</p>\\r\\n<p>The misfortune of Harriet''s cold had been pretty well gone through\\r\\nbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to\\r\\ngive the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\\r\\nIsabella''s coming, and of Emma''s being to follow, and had indeed just\\r\\ngot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\\r\\ndaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been\\r\\nalmost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away\\r\\nand welcome her dear Emma.</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma''s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather\\r\\nsorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close\\r\\nto her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility\\r\\ntowards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\\r\\nwas continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\\r\\nsolicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting\\r\\nhim, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\\r\\nsuggestion of \"Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be\\r\\npossible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\\r\\nHarriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!\"-- Yet he would be so anxious\\r\\nfor her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father,\\r\\nand so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\\r\\ndrawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\\r\\nlike a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\\r\\ngood manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for\\r\\nHarriet''s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even\\r\\npositively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was\\r\\ngoing on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.\\r\\nElton''s nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard\\r\\nenough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his\\r\\nson; she heard the words \"my son,\" and \"Frank,\" and \"my son,\" repeated\\r\\nseveral times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much\\r\\nsuspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but\\r\\nbefore she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past\\r\\nthat any reviving question from her would have been awkward.</p>\\r\\n<p>Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma''s resolution of never\\r\\nmarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank\\r\\nChurchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\\r\\nthought--especially since his father''s marriage with Miss Taylor--that\\r\\nif she <i>were</i> to marry, he was the very person to suit her in\\r\\nage, character and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\\r\\nfamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a\\r\\nmatch that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nWeston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not\\r\\nmeaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\\r\\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\\r\\nchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided\\r\\nintention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain\\r\\ndegree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in\\r\\ntheir friends'' imaginations.</p>\\r\\n<p>With such sensations, Mr. Elton''s civilities were dreadfully\\r\\nill-timed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while\\r\\nfeeling very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could\\r\\nnot possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,\\r\\nor the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it\\r\\nproved;-- for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr.\\r\\nWeston, at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares\\r\\nof hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to\\r\\nsay to her,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to\\r\\nsee two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my\\r\\nson--and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did\\r\\nnot hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are\\r\\nexpecting Frank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be\\r\\nwith us within a fortnight.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented\\r\\nto his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their\\r\\nparty quite complete.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He has been wanting to come to us,\" continued Mr. Weston, \"ever\\r\\nsince September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot\\r\\ncommand his own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and\\r\\nwho (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many\\r\\nsacrifices. But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second\\r\\nweek in January.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\\r\\nanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\\r\\nyourself.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another\\r\\nput-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she\\r\\ndoes not know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is--(but\\r\\nthis is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in\\r\\nthe other room. There are secrets in all families, you know)--The case\\r\\nis, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in\\r\\nJanuary; and that Frank''s coming depends upon their being put off. If\\r\\nthey are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it\\r\\nis a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has\\r\\na particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite\\r\\nthem once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes\\r\\nto the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as\\r\\nconfident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of\\r\\nbeing here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the\\r\\nupper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so\\r\\nlittle used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their\\r\\neffects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\"\\r\\nreplied Emma; \"but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you\\r\\nthink he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been\\r\\nat the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow\\r\\nmyself to speak ill of her, on Frank''s account; for I do believe her to\\r\\nbe very fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond\\r\\nof any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in\\r\\nher way--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every\\r\\nthing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to\\r\\nhim, that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not\\r\\nsay it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people\\r\\nin general; and the devil of a temper.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs.\\r\\nWeston, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her\\r\\njoy-- yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather\\r\\nalarming.-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be\\r\\nvery glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at\\r\\nthe time talked of: \"for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be\\r\\nso sanguine as Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end\\r\\nin nothing. Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how\\r\\nthe matter stands?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\\r\\nChurchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My Emma!\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"what is the certainty of\\r\\ncaprice?\" Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\\r\\nbefore--\"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\\r\\nso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\\r\\nthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt''s spirits and pleasure; in\\r\\nshort, upon her temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on\\r\\nthe truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\\r\\nwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\" replied\\r\\nIsabella: \"and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without\\r\\nthe greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered\\r\\nperson, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any\\r\\nthing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she\\r\\nnever had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would\\r\\nhave made them!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then\\r\\nhave heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of\\r\\nunreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really\\r\\nbelieved, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the\\r\\nChurchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which\\r\\nher own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.\\r\\nBut at present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very\\r\\nsoon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after\\r\\ndinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\\r\\nconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\\r\\nwhom he was always comfortable.</p>\\r\\n<p>While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of saying,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\\r\\ncertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\\r\\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.\\r\\nEven if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid\\r\\nthat some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to\\r\\nimagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish\\r\\non the Churchills'' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They\\r\\nare jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\\r\\ndependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He ought to come,\" said Emma. \"If he could stay only a couple of\\r\\ndays, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man''s not\\r\\nhaving it in his power to do as much as that. A young <i>woman</i>, if\\r\\nshe fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance from\\r\\nthose she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young <i>man''</i>s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he likes it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,\\r\\nbefore one decides upon what he can do,\" replied Mrs. Weston. \"One\\r\\nought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of\\r\\nany one individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe,\\r\\ncertainly must not be judged by general rules: <i>she</i> is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.\\r\\nNow, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\\r\\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to\\r\\nwhom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\\r\\ntowards <i>him</i>, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to\\r\\nunderstand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go\\r\\nits own way. I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable\\r\\ninfluence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know\\r\\nbeforehand <i>when</i> it will be.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma listened, and then coolly said, \"I shall not be satisfied, unless he comes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,\" continued\\r\\nMrs. Weston, \"and on others, very little: and among those, on which she\\r\\nis beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very\\r\\ncircumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.\"</p>'", "id": 95, "section_id": 117},{"content": " '<b>Chapter XIII: Of Auxiliary, Mixed, and National Arms</b><br /><br />The second sort of unprofitable arms are auxiliaries, by whom I mean, troops brought to help and protect you by a potentate whom you summon to your aid; as when in recent times, Pope Julius II observing the pitiful behaviour of his mercenaries at the enterprise of Ferrara, betook himself to auxiliaries, and arranged with Ferdinand of Spain to be supplied with horse and foot soldiers.<br /><br />Auxiliaries may be excellent and useful soldiers for themselves, but are always hurtful to him who calls them in; for if they are defeated, he is undone, if victorious, he becomes their prisoner. Ancient histories abound with instances of this, but I shall not pass from the example of Pope Julius, which is still fresh in men&rsquo;s minds. It was the height of rashness for him, in his eagerness to gain Ferrara, to throw himself without reserve into the arms of a stranger. Nevertheless, his good fortune came to his rescue, and he had not to reap the fruits of his ill-considered conduct. For after his auxiliaries were defeated at Ravenna, the Swiss suddenly descended and, to their own surprise and that of every one else, swept the victors out of the country, so that, he neither remained a prisoner with his enemies, they being put to flight, nor with his auxiliaries, because victory was won by other arms than theirs. The Florentines, being wholly without soldiers of their own, brought ten thousand French men-at-arms to the siege of Pisa, thereby incurring greater peril than at any previous time of trouble. To protect himself from his neighbours, the Emperor of Constantinople summoned ten thousand Turkish soldiers into Greece, who, when the war was over, refused to leave, and this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to the Infidel.<br /><br />Let him, therefore, who would deprive himself of every chance of success, have recourse to auxiliaries, these being far more dangerous than mercenary arms, bringing ruin with them ready made. For they are united, and wholly under the control of their own officers; whereas, before mercenaries, even after gaining a victory, can do you hurt, longer time and better opportunities are needed; because, as they are made up of separate companies, raised and paid by you, he whom you place in command cannot at once acquire such authority over them as will be injurious to you. In short, with mercenaries your greatest danger is from their inertness and cowardice, with auxiliaries from their valour. Wise Princes, therefore, have always eschewed these arms, and trusted rather to their own, and have preferred defeat with the latter to victory with the former, counting that as no true victory which is gained by foreign aid.<br /><br />I shall never hesitate to cite the example of Cesare Borgia and his actions. He entered Romagna with a force of auxiliaries, all of them French men-at-arms, with whom he took Imola and Forli. But it appearing to him afterwards that these troops were not to be trusted, he had recourse to mercenaries from whom he thought there would be less danger, and took the Orsini and Vitelli into his pay. But finding these likewise while under his command to be fickle, false, and treacherous, he got rid of them, and fell back on troops of his own raising. And we may readily discern the difference between these various kinds of arms, by observing the different degrees of reputation in which the Duke stood while he depended upon the French alone, when he took the Orsini and Vitelli into his pay, and when he fell back on his own troops and his own resources; for we find his reputation always increasing, and that he was never so well thought of as when every one perceived him to be sole master of his own forces.<br /><br />I am unwilling to leave these examples, drawn from what has taken place in Italy and in recent times; and yet I must not omit to notice the case of Hiero of Syracuse, who is one of those whom I have already named. He, as I have before related, being made captain of their armies by the Syracusans, saw at once that a force of mercenary soldiers, supplied by men resembling our Italian condottieri, was not serviceable; and as he would not retain and could not disband them, he caused them all to be cut to pieces, and afterwards made war with native soldiers only, without other aid.<br /><br />And here I would call to mind a passage in the Old Testament as bearing on this point. When David offered himself to Saul to go forth and fight Goliath the Philistine champion, Saul to encourage him armed him with his own armour, which David, so soon as he had put it on, rejected, saying that with these untried arms he could not prevail, and that he chose rather to meet his enemy with only his sling and his sword. In a word, the armour of others is too wide, or too strait for us; it falls off us, or it weighs us down.<br /><br />Charles VII, the father of Louis XI, who by his good fortune and valour freed France from the English, saw this necessity of strengthening himself with a national army, and drew up ordinances regulating the service both of men-at-arms and of foot soldiers throughout his kingdom. But afterwards his son, King Louis, did away with the national infantry, and began to hire Swiss mercenaries. Which blunder having been followed by subsequent Princes, has been the cause, as the result shows, of the dangers into which the kingdom of France has fallen; for, by enhancing the reputation of the Swiss, the whole of the national troops of France have been deteriorated. For from their infantry being done away with, their men-at-arms are made wholly dependent on foreign assistance, and being accustomed to co-operate with the Swiss, have grown to think they can do nothing without them. Hence the French are no match for the Swiss, and without them cannot succeed against others.<br /><br />The armies of France, then, are mixed, being partly national and partly mercenary. Armies thus composed are far superior to mere mercenaries or mere auxiliaries, but far inferior to forces purely national. And this example is in itself conclusive, for the realm of France would be invincible if the military ordinances of Charles VII had been retained and extended. But from want of foresight men make changes which relishing well at first do not betray their hidden venom, as I have already observed respecting hectic fever. Nevertheless, the ruler is not truly wise who cannot discern evils before they develop themselves, and this is a faculty given to few.<br /><br />If we look for the causes which first led to the overthrow of the Roman Empire, they will be found to have had their source in the employment of Gothic mercenaries, for from that hour the strength of the Romans began to wane and all the virtue which went from them passed to the Goths. And, to be brief, I say that without national arms no Princedom is safe, but on the contrary is wholly dependent on Fortune, being without the strength that could defend it in adversity. And it has always been the deliberate opinion of the wise, that nothing is so infirm and fleeting as a reputation for power not founded upon a national army, by which I mean one composed of subjects, citizens, and dependents, all others being mercenary or auxiliary.<br /><br />The methods to be followed for organizing a national army may readily be ascertained, if the rules above laid down by me, and by which I abide, be well considered, and attention be given to the manner in which Philip, father of Alexander the Great, and many other Princes and Republics have armed and disposed their forces.<br /><br />'", "id": 112, "section_id": 134},{"content": " '<b>Dedication: To the Magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De&rsquo; Medici<br /></b><br />It is customary for such as seek a Prince&rsquo;s favour, to present themselves before him with those things of theirs which they themselves most value, or in which they perceive him chiefly to delight. Accordingly, we often see horses, armour, cloth of gold, precious stones, and the like costly gifts, offered to Princes as worthy of their greatness. Desiring in like manner to approach your Magnificence with some token of my devotion, I have found among my possessions none that I so much prize and esteem as a knowledge of the actions of great men, acquired in the course of a long experience of modern affairs and a continual study of antiquity. Which knowledge most carefully and patiently pondered over and sifted by me, and now reduced into this little book, I send to your Magnificence. And though I deem the work unworthy of your greatness, yet am I bold enough to hope that your courtesy will dispose you to accept it, considering that I can offer you no better gift than the means of mastering in a very brief time, all that in the course of so many years, and at the cost of so many hardships and dangers, I have learned, and know.<br /><br />This work I have not adorned or amplified with rounded periods, swelling and high-flown language, or any other of those extrinsic attractions and allurements wherewith many authors are wont to set off and grace their writings; since it is my desire that it should either pass wholly unhonoured, or that the truth of its matter and the importance of its subject should alone recommend it.<br /><br />Nor would I have it thought presumption that a person of very mean and humble station should venture to discourse and lay down rules concerning the government of Princes. For as those who make maps of countries place themselves low down in the plains to study the character of mountains and elevated lands, and place themselves high up on the mountains to get a better view of the plains, so in like manner to understand the People a man should be a Prince, and to have a clear notion of Princes he should belong to the People.<br /><br />Let your Magnificence, then, accept this little gift in the spirit in which I offer it; wherein, if you diligently read and study it, you will recognize my extreme desire that you should attain to that eminence which Fortune and your own merits promise you.

Princedoms are either hereditary, in which the sovereignty is derived through an ancient line of ancestors, or they are new. New Princedoms are either wholly new, as that of Milan to Francesco Sforza; or they are like limbs joined on to the hereditary possessions of the Prince who acquires them, as the Kingdom of Naples to the dominions of the King of Spain. The States thus acquired have either been used to live under a Prince or have been free; and he who acquires them does so either by his own arms or by the arms of others, and either by good fortune or by merit.<br /><br />'", "id": 98, "section_id": 120},{"content": " '<b>Chapter II: Of Hereditary Princedoms<br /><br /></b>Of Republics I shall not now speak, having elsewhere spoken of them at length. Here I shall treat exclusively of Princedoms, and, filling in the outline above traced out, shall proceed to examine how such States are to be governed and maintained.<br /><br />I say, then, that hereditary States, accustomed to the family of their Prince, are maintained with far less difficulty than new States, since all that is required is that the Prince shall not depart from the usages of his ancestors, trusting for the rest to deal with events as they arise. So that if an hereditary Prince be of average address, he will always maintain himself in his Princedom, unless deprived of it by some extraordinary and irresistible force; and even if so deprived will recover it, should any, even the least, mishap overtake the usurper. We have in Italy an example of this in the Duke of Ferrara, who never could have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in 1484, nor those of Pope Julius in 1510, had not his authority in that State been consolidated by time. For since a Prince by birth has fewer occasions and less need to give offence, he ought to be better loved, and will naturally be popular with his subjects unless outrageous vices make him odious. Moreover, the very antiquity and continuance of his rule will efface the memories and causes which lead to innovation. For one change always leaves a dovetail into which another will fit.<b><br /><br /></b>'", "id": 99, "section_id": 121},{"content": " '<b>Chapter III: Of Mixed Princedoms</b><br /><br />But in new Princedoms difficulties abound. And, first, if the Princedom be not wholly new, but joined on to the ancient dominions of the Prince, so as to form with them what may be termed a mixed Princedom, changes will come from a cause common to all new States, namely, that men, thinking to better their condition, are always ready to change masters, and in this expectation will take up arms against any ruler; wherein they deceive themselves, and find afterwards by experience that they are worse off than before. This again results naturally and necessarily from the circumstance that the Prince cannot avoid giving offence to his new subjects, either in respect of the troops he quarters on them, or of some other of the numberless vexations attendant on a new acquisition. And in this way you may find that you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing the Princedom, yet cannot keep the friendship of those who helped you to gain it; since you can neither reward them as they expect, nor yet, being under obligations to them, use violent remedies against them. For however strong you may be in respect of your army, it is essential that in entering a new Province you should have the good will of its inhabitants.<br /><br />Hence it happened that Louis XII of France, speedily gaining possession of Milan, as speedily lost it; and that on the occasion of its first capture, Lodovico Sforza was able with his own forces only to take it from him. For the very people who had opened the gates to the French King, when they found themselves deceived in their expectations and hopes of future benefits, could not put up with the insolence of their new ruler. True it is that when a State rebels and is again got under, it will not afterwards be lost so easily. For the Prince, using the rebellion as a pretext, will not scruple to secure himself by punishing the guilty, bringing the suspected to trial, and otherwise strengthening his position in the points where it was weak. So that if to recover Milan from the French it was enough on the first occasion that a Duke Lodovico should raise alarms on the frontiers to wrest it from them a second time the whole world had to be ranged against them, and their armies destroyed and driven out of Italy. And this for the reasons above assigned. And yet, for a second time, Milan was lost to the King. The general causes of its first loss have been shown. It remains to note the causes of the second, and to point out the remedies which the French King had, or which might have been used by another in like circumstances to maintain his conquest more successfully than he did.<br /><br />I say, then, that those States which upon their acquisition are joined on to the ancient dominions of the Prince who acquires them, are either of the same Province and tongue as the people of these dominions, or they are not. When they are, there is a great ease in retaining them, especially when they have not been accustomed to live in freedom. To hold them securely it is enough to have rooted out the line of the reigning Prince; because if in other respects the old condition of things be continued, and there be no discordance in their customs, men live peaceably with one another, as we see to have been the case in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and Normandy, which have so long been united to France. For although there be some slight difference in their languages, their customs are similar, and they can easily get on together. He, therefore, who acquires such a State, if he mean to keep it, must see to two things; first, that the blood of the ancient line of Princes be destroyed; second, that no change be made in respect of laws or taxes; for in this way the newly acquired State speedily becomes incorporated with the hereditary.<br /><br />But when States are acquired in a country differing in language, usages, and laws, difficulties multiply, and great good fortune, as well as address, is needed to overcome them. One of the best and most efficacious methods for dealing with such a State, is for the Prince who acquires it to go and dwell there in person, since this will tend to make his tenure more secure and lasting. This course has been followed by the Turk with regard to Greece, who, had he not, in addition to all his other precautions for securing that Province, himself come to live in it, could never have kept his hold of it. For when you are on the spot, disorders are detected in their beginnings and remedies can be readily applied; but when you are at a distance, they are not heard of until they have gathered strength and the case is past cure. Moreover, the Province in which you take up your abode is not pillaged by your officers; the people are pleased to have a ready recourse to their Prince; and have all the more reason if they are well disposed, to love, if disaffected, to fear him. A foreign enemy desiring to attack that State would be cautious how he did so. In short, where the Prince resides in person, it will be extremely difficult to oust him.<br /><br />Another excellent expedient is to send colonies into one or two places, so that these may become, as it were, the keys of the Province; for you must either do this, or else keep up a numerous force of men-at-arms and foot soldiers. A Prince need not spend much on colonies. He can send them out and support them at little or no charge to himself, and the only persons to whom he gives offence are those whom he deprives of their fields and houses to bestow them on the new inhabitants. Those who are thus injured form but a small part of the community, and remaining scattered and poor can never become dangerous. All others being left unmolested, are in consequence easily quieted, and at the same time are afraid to make a false move, lest they share the fate of those who have been deprived of their possessions. In few words, these colonies cost less than soldiers, are more faithful, and give less offence, while those who are offended, being, as I have said, poor and dispersed, cannot hurt. And let it here be noted that men are either to be kindly treated, or utterly crushed, since they can revenge lighter injuries, but not graver. Wherefore the injury we do to a man should be of a sort to leave no fear of reprisals.<br /><br />But if instead of colonies you send troops, the cost is vastly greater, and the whole revenues of the country are spent in guarding it; so that the gain becomes a loss, and much deeper offence is given; since in shifting the quarters of your soldiers from place to place the whole country suffers hardship, which as all feel, all are made enemies; and enemies who remaining, although vanquished, in their own homes, have power to hurt. In every way, therefore, this mode of defence is as disadvantageous as that by colonizing is useful.<br /><br />The Prince who establishes himself in a Province whose laws and language differ from those of his own people, ought also to make himself the head and protector of his feebler neighbours, and endeavour to weaken the stronger, and must see that by no accident shall any other stranger as powerful as himself find an entrance there. For it will always happen that some such person will be called in by those of the Province who are discontented either through ambition or fear; as we see of old the Romans brought into Greece by the Aetolians, and in every other country that they entered, invited there by its inhabitants. And the usual course of things is that so soon as a formidable stranger enters a Province, all the weaker powers side with him, moved thereto by the ill-will they bear towards him who has hitherto kept them in subjection. So that in respect of these lesser powers, no trouble is needed to gain them over, for at once, together, and of their own accord, they throw in their lot with the government of the stranger. The new Prince, therefore, has only to see that they do not increase too much in strength, and with his own forces, aided by their good will, can easily subdue any who are powerful, so as to remain supreme in the Province. He who does not manage this matter well, will soon lose whatever he has gained, and while he retains it will find in it endless troubles and annoyances.<br /><br />In dealing with the countries of which they took possession the Romans diligently followed the methods I have described. They planted colonies, conciliated weaker powers without adding to their strength, humbled the great, and never suffered a formidable stranger to acquire influence. A single example will suffice to show this. In Greece the Romans took the Achaians and Aetolians into their pay; the Macedonian monarchy was humbled; Antiochus was driven out. But the services of the Achaians and Aetolians never obtained for them any addition to their power; no persuasions on the part of Philip could induce the Romans to be his friends on the condition of sparing him humiliation; nor could all the power of Antiochus bring them to consent to his exercising any authority within that Province. And in thus acting the Romans did as all wise rulers should, who have to consider not only present difficulties but also future, against which they must use all diligence to provide; for these, if they be foreseen while yet remote, admit of easy remedy, but if their approach be awaited, are already past cure, the disorder having become hopeless; realizing what the physicians tell us of hectic fever, that in its beginning it is easy to cure, but hard to recognize; whereas, after a time, not having been detected and treated at the first, it becomes easy to recognize but impossible to cure.<br /><br />And so it is with State affairs. For the distempers of a State being discovered while yet inchoate, which can only be done by a sagacious ruler, may easily be dealt with; but when, from not being observed, they are suffered to grow until they are obvious to every one, there is no longer any remedy. The Romans, therefore, foreseeing evils while they were yet far off, always provided against them, and never suffered them to take their course for the sake of avoiding war; since they knew that war is not so to be avoided, but is only postponed to the advantage of the other side. They chose, therefore, to make war with Philip and Antiochus in Greece, that they might not have to make it with them in Italy, although for a while they might have escaped both. This they did not desire, nor did the maxim leave it to Time, which the wise men of our own day have always on their lips, ever recommend itself to them. What they looked to enjoy were the fruits of their own valour and foresight. For Time, driving all things before it, may bring with it evil as well as good.<br /><br />But let us now go back to France and examine whether she has followed any of those methods of which I have made mention. I shall speak of Louis and not of Charles, because from the former having held longer possession of Italy, his manner of acting is more plainly seen. You will find, then, that he has done the direct opposite of what he should have done in order to retain a foreign State.<br /><br />King Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who hoped by his coming to gain for themselves a half of the State of Lombardy. I will not blame this coming, nor the part taken by the King, because, desiring to gain a footing in Italy, where he had no friends, but on the contrary, owing to the conduct of Charles, every door was shut against him, he was driven to accept such friendships as he could get. And his designs might easily have succeeded had he not made mistakes in other particulars of conduct.<br /><br />By the recovery of Lombardy, Louis at once regained the credit which Charles had lost. Genoa made submission; the Florentines came to terms; the Marquis of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivogli, the Countess of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, Pesaro, Rimini, Camerino, and Piombino, the citizens of Lucca, Pisa, and Siena, all came forward offering their friendship. The Venetians, who to obtain possession of a couple of towns in Lombardy had made the French King master of two-thirds of Italy, had now cause to repent the rash game they had played.<br /><br />Let any one, therefore, consider how easily King Louis might have maintained his authority in Italy had he observed the rules which I have noted above, and secured and protected all those friends of his, who being weak, and fearful, some of the Church, some of the Venetians, were of necessity obliged to attach themselves to him, and with whose assistance, for they were many, he might readily have made himself safe against any other powerful State. But no sooner was he in Milan than he took a contrary course, in helping Pope Alexander to occupy Romagna; not perceiving that in seconding this enterprise he weakened himself by alienating friends and those who had thrown themselves into his arms, while he strengthened the Church by adding great temporal power to the spiritual power which of itself confers so mighty an authority. Making this first mistake, he was forced to follow it up, until at last, in order to curb the ambition of Pope Alexander, and prevent him becoming master of Tuscany, he was obliged to come himself into Italy.<br /><br />And as though it were not enough for him to have aggrandized the Church and stripped himself of friends, he must needs in his desire to possess the Kingdom of Naples, divide it with the King of Spain; thus bringing into Italy, where before he had been supreme, a rival to whom the ambitious and discontented in that Province might have recourse. And whereas he might have left in Naples a King willing to hold as his tributary, he displaced him to make way for another strong enough to effect his expulsion. The wish to acquire is no doubt a natural and common sentiment, and when men attempt things within their power, they will always be praised rather than blamed. But when they persist in attempts that are beyond their power, mishaps and blame ensue. If France, therefore, with her own forces could have attacked Naples, she should have done so. If she could not, she ought not to have divided it. And if her partition of Lombardy with the Venetians may be excused as the means whereby a footing was gained in Italy, this other partition is to be condemned as not justified by the like necessity.<br /><br />Louis, then, had made these five blunders. He had destroyed weaker States, he had strengthened a Prince already strong, he had brought into the country a very powerful stranger, he had not come to reside, and he had not sent colonies. And yet all these blunders might not have proved disastrous to him while he lived, had he not added to them a sixth in depriving the Venetians of their dominions. For had he neither aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain into Italy, it might have been at once reasonable and necessary to humble the Venetians; but after committing himself to these other courses, he should never have consented to the ruin of Venice. For while the Venetians were powerful they would always have kept others back from an attempt on Lombardy, as well because they never would have agreed to that enterprise on any terms save of themselves being made its masters, as because others would never have desired to take it from France in order to hand it over to them, nor would ever have ventured to defy both. And if it be said that King Louis ceded Romagna to Alexander, and Naples to Spain in order to avoid war, I answer that for the reasons already given, you ought never to suffer your designs to be crossed in order to avoid war, since war is not so to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. And if others should allege the King&rsquo;s promise to the Pope to undertake that enterprise on his behalf, in return for the dissolution of his marriage, and for the Cardinal&rsquo;s hat conferred on d&rsquo;Amboise, I answer by referring to what I say further on concerning the faith of Princes and how it is to be kept.<br /><br />King Louis, therefore, lost Lombardy from not following any one of the methods pursued by others who have taken Provinces with the resolve to keep them. Nor is this anything strange, but only what might reasonably and naturally be looked for. And on this very subject I spoke to d&rsquo;Amboise at Nantes, at the time when Duke Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, son to Pope Alexander, was vulgarly called, was occupying Romagna. For, on the Cardinal saying to me that the Italians did not understand war, I answered that the French did not understand statecraft, for had they done so, they never would have allowed the Church to grow so powerful. And the event shows that the aggrandizement of the Church and of Spain in Italy has been brought about by France, and that the ruin of France has been wrought by them. Whence we may draw the general axiom, which never or rarely errs, that he who is the cause of another&rsquo;s greatness is himself undone, since he must work either by address or force, each of which excites distrust in the person raised to power.<br /><br /><br />'", "id": 100, "section_id": 122},{"content": " '<p><br clear=\"&quot;all&quot;\" />\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea\\r\\nhe was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\\r\\ncompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of\\r\\nthe hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty\\r\\nand convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at\\r\\nlast the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation.

He began with\\r\\ngreat earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the\\r\\nsick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat her to <i>promise</i> <i>him</i>\\r\\nnot to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt\\r\\nhis opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject\\r\\nback into its proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme\\r\\nsolicitude about her.

It did appear--there was no\\r\\nconcealing it--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her,\\r\\ninstead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and\\r\\nabominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper.

I dare say we shall be all safe at\\r\\nHartfield before midnight.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\\r\\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it\\r\\nshould make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\\r\\nhurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\\r\\nto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid\\r\\nthey would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,\\r\\nthat he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\\r\\ngood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\\r\\ncalling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\\r\\nevery body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\\r\\nconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?\" was Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse''s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.\\r\\nTo her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\\r\\nrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\\r\\ntheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.</p>\\r\\n<p>His eldest daughter''s alarm was equal to his own. The horror of\\r\\nbeing blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was\\r\\nfull in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable\\r\\nfor adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was\\r\\neager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at\\r\\nRandalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all\\r\\nthe possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\" said she; \"I\\r\\ndare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if\\r\\nwe do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.

I could change my\\r\\nshoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing\\r\\nthat gives me cold.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Indeed!\" replied he. \"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\\r\\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\\r\\ndoes give you cold.

Mrs.\\r\\nWeston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\\r\\nnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\\r\\nand they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\\r\\nleft the room immediately after his brother''s first report of the snow,\\r\\ncame back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to\\r\\nexamine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty\\r\\nin their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour\\r\\nhence. He had gone beyond the sweep-- some way along the Highbury\\r\\nroad--the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep--in many places\\r\\nhardly enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at\\r\\npresent, but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of\\r\\nits being soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed\\r\\nwith him in there being nothing to apprehend.</p>\\r\\n<p>To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they\\r\\nwere scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father''s account, who was\\r\\nimmediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\\r\\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\\r\\nappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\\r\\nRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\\r\\nreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\\r\\nto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\\r\\nMr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am ready, if the others are.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Shall I ring the bell?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, do.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.

He was afraid poor\\r\\nIsabella would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the\\r\\ncarriage behind. He did not know what they had best do. They must keep\\r\\nas much together as they could;\" and James was talked to, and given a\\r\\ncharge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.</p>\\r\\n<p>Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that\\r\\nhe did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very\\r\\nnaturally; so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the\\r\\nsecond carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on\\r\\nthem, and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It would not have\\r\\nbeen the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\\r\\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\\r\\nhim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\\r\\none. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\\r\\nbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston''s good wine, and felt sure that he\\r\\nwould want to be talking nonsense.</p>\\r\\n<p>To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\\r\\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\\r\\nthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\\r\\nthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\\r\\nfound her subject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded, and\\r\\nMr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the\\r\\nprecious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well\\r\\nknown, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him; but\\r\\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\\r\\nunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\\r\\nvery much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\\r\\nreally was so. Without scruple--without apology-- without much apparent\\r\\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself <i>her</i>\\r\\nlover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say it\\r\\nall. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\\r\\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\\r\\nbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\\r\\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\\r\\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\\r\\nreplied,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to <i>me</i>! you forget\\r\\nyourself-- you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall\\r\\nbe happy to deliver; but no more of this to <i>me</i>, if you please.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly\\r\\nmean!\"-- And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such\\r\\nboastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with\\r\\nquickness,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can\\r\\naccount for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not\\r\\nspeak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself\\r\\nenough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not\\r\\nat all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning;\\r\\nand having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious,\\r\\nand slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--\\r\\nbut acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at\\r\\nall,--he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent\\r\\nfor a favourable answer.</p>\\r\\n<p>As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\\r\\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\\r\\nreplied,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\\r\\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\\r\\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\\r\\nmonth, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daily habit\\r\\nof observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is an\\r\\nunsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!\\r\\nBelieve me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object\\r\\nof such professions.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good Heaven!\" cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?--\\r\\nMiss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\\r\\nexistence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\\r\\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has\\r\\nfancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\\r\\nsorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse!\\r\\nwho can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\\r\\nhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\\r\\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\\r\\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\\r\\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot\\r\\nreally, seriously, doubt it. No!--(in an accent meant to be\\r\\ninsinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--\\r\\nwhich of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too\\r\\ncompletely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments\\r\\nof silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton''s sanguine state of\\r\\nmind, he tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed--</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence. It confesses that you have long understood me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, sir,\" cried Emma, \"it confesses no such thing. So far from\\r\\nhaving long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with\\r\\nrespect to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry\\r\\nthat you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be\\r\\nfarther from my wishes--your attachment to my friend Harriet--your\\r\\npursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I\\r\\nhave been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that\\r\\nshe were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have\\r\\nthought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to\\r\\nbelieve that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly\\r\\nto Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn: \"never, I assure you. <i>I</i>\\r\\nthink seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl;\\r\\nand I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her\\r\\nextremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\\r\\nto--Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\\r\\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\\r\\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No, madam, my\\r\\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement\\r\\nI received--\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been\\r\\nentirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer\\r\\nof my friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a\\r\\ncommon acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the\\r\\nmistake ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss\\r\\nSmith might have been led into a misconception of your views; not being\\r\\naware, probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality\\r\\nwhich you are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is\\r\\nsingle, and, I trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of\\r\\nmatrimony at present.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to\\r\\ninvite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and\\r\\nmutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few\\r\\nminutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a\\r\\nfoot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have been\\r\\ndesperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room\\r\\nfor the little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the\\r\\ncarriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found\\r\\nthemselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out\\r\\nbefore another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to\\r\\nwish him a good night. The compliment was just returned, coldly and\\r\\nproudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits, she was then\\r\\nconveyed to Hartfield.</p>\\r\\n<p>There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who\\r\\nhad been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage\\r\\nLane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of-- and in\\r\\nstrange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it seemed as\\r\\nif her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.\\r\\nJohn Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and\\r\\nattention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her\\r\\nfather, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin of\\r\\ngruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the\\r\\nday was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\\r\\nexcept herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and\\r\\nit needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till\\r\\nthe usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.</p>'", "id": 109, "section_id": 131},{"content": " '<b>Chapter IV: Why the Kingdom of Darius, Conquered by Alexander, Did Not, on Alexander&rsquo;s Death, Rebel Against His Successors</b><br /><br />Alexander the Great having achieved the conquest of Asia in a few years, and dying before he had well entered on possession, it might have been expected, having regard to the difficulty of preserving newly acquired States, that on his death the whole country would rise in revolt. Nevertheless, his successors were able to keep their hold, and found in doing so no other difficulty than arose from their own ambition and mutual jealousies.<br /><br />If any one think this strange and ask the cause, I answer, that all the Princedoms of which we have record have been governed in one or other of two ways, either by a sole Prince, all others being his servants permitted by his grace and favour to assist in governing the kingdom as his ministers; or else, by a Prince with his Barons who hold their rank, not by the favour of a superior Lord, but by antiquity of blood, and who have States and subjects of their own who recognize them as their rulers and entertain for them a natural affection. States governed by a sole Prince and by his servants vest in him a more complete authority; because throughout the land none but he is recognized as sovereign, and if obedience be yielded to any others, it is yielded as to his ministers and officers for whom personally no special love is felt.<br /><br />Of these two forms of government we have examples in our own days in the Turk and the King of France. The whole Turkish empire is governed by a sole Prince, all others being his slaves. Dividing his kingdom into sandjaks, he sends thither different governors whom he shifts and changes at his pleasure. The King of France, on the other hand, is surrounded by a multitude of nobles of ancient descent, each acknowledged and loved by subjects of his own, and each asserting a precedence in rank of which the King can deprive him only at his peril.<br /><br />He, therefore, who considers the different character of these two States, will perceive that it would be difficult to gain possession of that of the Turk, but that once won it might be easily held. The obstacles to its conquest are that the invader cannot be called in by a native nobility, nor expect his enterprise to be aided by the defection of those whom the sovereign has around him. And this for the various reasons already given, namely, that all being slaves and under obligations they are not easily corrupted, or if corrupted can render little assistance, being unable, as I have already explained, to carry the people with them. Whoever, therefore, attacks the Turk must reckon on finding a united people, and must trust rather to his own strength than to divisions on the other side. But were his adversary once overcome and defeated in the field, so that he could not repair his armies, no cause for anxiety would remain, except in the family of the Prince; which being extirpated, there would be none else to fear; for since all beside are without credit with the people, the invader, as before his victory he had nothing to hope from them, so after it has nothing to dread.<br /><br />But the contrary is the case in kingdoms governed like that of France, into which, because men who are discontented and desirous of change are always to be found, you may readily procure an entrance by gaining over some Baron of the Realm. Such persons, for the reasons already given, are able to open the way to you for the invasion of their country and to render its conquest easy. But afterwards the effort to hold your ground involves you in endless difficulties, as well in respect of those who have helped you, as of those whom you have overthrown. Nor will it be enough to have destroyed the family of the Prince, since all those other Lords remain to put themselves at the head of new movements; whom being unable either to content or to destroy, you lose the State whenever occasion serves them.<br /><br />Now, if you examine the nature of the government of Darius, you will find that it resembled that of the Turk, and, consequently, that it was necessary for Alexander, first of all, to defeat him utterly and strip him of his dominions; after which defeat, Darius having died, the country, for the causes above explained, was permanently secured to Alexander. And had his successors continued united they might have enjoyed it undisturbed, since there arose no disorders in that kingdom save those of their own creating.<br /><br />But kingdoms ordered like that of France cannot be retained with the same ease. Hence the repeated risings of Spain, Gaul, and Greece against the Romans, resulting from the number of small Princedoms of which these Provinces were made up. For while the memory of these lasted, the Romans could never think their tenure safe. But when that memory was worn out by the authority and long continuance of their rule, they gained a secure hold, and were able afterwards in their contests among themselves, each to carry with him some portion of these Provinces, according as each had acquired influence there; for these, on the extinction of the line of their old Princes, came to recognize no other Lords than the Romans.<br /><br />Bearing all this in mind, no one need wonder at the ease wherewith Alexander was able to lay a firm hold on Asia, nor that Pyrrhus and many others found difficulty in preserving other acquisitions; since this arose, not from the less or greater merit of the conquerors, but from the different character of the States with which they had to deal.<br /><br />'", "id": 101, "section_id": 123},{"content": " '<b>Chapter V: How Cities or Provinces Which Before Their Acquisition Have Lived Under Their Own Laws Are To Be Governed</b><br /><br />When a newly acquired State has been accustomed, as I have said, to live under its own laws and in freedom, there are three methods whereby it may be held. The first is to destroy it; the second, to go and reside there in person; the third, to suffer it to live on under its own laws, subjecting it to a tribute, and entrusting its government to a few of the inhabitants who will keep the rest your friends. Such a Government, since it is the creature of the new Prince, will see that it cannot stand without his protection and support, and must therefore do all it can to maintain him; and a city accustomed to live in freedom, if it is to be preserved at all, is more easily controlled through its own citizens than in any other way.<br /><br />We have examples of all these methods in the histories of the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held Athens and Thebes by creating oligarchies in these cities, yet lost them in the end. The Romans, to retain Capua, Carthage, and Numantia, destroyed them and never lost them. On the other hand, when they thought to hold Greece as the Spartans had held it, leaving it its freedom and allowing it to be governed by its own laws, they failed, and had to destroy many cities of that Province before they could secure it. For, in truth, there is no sure way of holding other than by destroying, and whoever becomes master of a City accustomed to live in freedom and does not destroy it, may reckon on being destroyed by it. For if it should rebel, it can always screen itself under the name of liberty and its ancient laws, which no length of time, nor any benefits conferred will ever cause it to forget; and do what you will, and take what care you may, unless the inhabitants be scattered and dispersed, this name, and the old order of things, will never cease to be remembered, but will at once be turned against you whenever misfortune overtakes you, as when Pisa rose against the Florentines after a hundred years of servitude.<br /><br />If, however, the newly acquired City or Province has been accustomed to live under a Prince, and his line is extinguished, it will be impossible for the citizens, used, on the one hand, to obey, and deprived, on the other, of their old ruler, to agree to choose a leader from among themselves; and as they know not how to live as freemen, and are therefore slow to take up arms, a stranger may readily gain them over and attach them to his cause. But in Republics there is a stronger vitality, a fiercer hatred, a keener thirst for revenge. The memory of their former freedom will not let them rest; so that the safest course is either to destroy them, or to go and live in them.<br /><br />'", "id": 102, "section_id": 124},{"content": " '<b>Chapter VI: Of New Princedoms Which a Prince Acquires With His Own Arms and by Merit</b><br /><br />Let no man marvel if in what I am about to say concerning Princedoms wholly new, both as regards the Prince and the form of Government, I cite the highest examples. For since men for the most part follow in the footsteps and imitate the actions of others, and yet are unable to adhere exactly to those paths which others have taken, or attain to the virtues of those whom they would resemble, the wise man should always follow the roads that have been trodden by the great, and imitate those who have most excelled, so that if he cannot reach their perfection, he may at least acquire something of its savour. Acting in this like the skilful archer, who seeing that the object he would hit is distant, and knowing the range of his bow, takes aim much above the destined mark; not designing that his arrow should strike so high, but that flying high it may alight at the point intended.<br /><br />I say, then, that in entirely new Princedoms where the Prince himself is new, the difficulty of maintaining possession varies with the greater or less ability of him who acquires possession. And, because the mere fact of a private person rising to be a Prince presupposes either merit or good fortune, it will be seen that the presence of one or other of these two conditions lessens, to some extent, many difficulties. And yet, he who is less beholden to Fortune has often in the end the better success; and it may be for the advantage of a Prince that, from his having no other territories, he is obliged to reside in person in the State which he has acquired.<br /><br />Looking first to those who have become Princes by their merit and not by their good fortune, I say that the most excellent among them are Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and the like. And though perhaps I ought not to name Moses, he being merely an instrument for carrying out the Divine commands, he is still to be admired for those qualities which made him worthy to converse with God. But if we consider Cyrus and the others who have acquired or founded kingdoms, they will all be seen to be admirable. And if their actions and the particular institutions of which they were the authors be studied, they will be found not to differ from those of Moses, instructed though he was by so great a teacher. Moreover, on examining their lives and actions, we shall see that they were debtors to Fortune for nothing beyond the opportunity which enabled them to shape things as they pleased, without which the force of their spirit would have been spent in vain; as on the other hand, opportunity would have offered itself in vain, had the capacity for turning it to account been wanting. It was necessary, therefore, that Moses should find the children of Israel in bondage in Egypt, and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that they might be disposed to follow him, and so escape from their servitude. It was fortunate for Romulus that he found no home in Alba, but was exposed at the time of his birth, to the end that he might become king and founder of the City of Rome. It was necessary that Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the rule of the Medes, and the Medes enervated and effeminate from a prolonged peace. Nor could Theseus have displayed his great qualities had he not found the Athenians disunited and dispersed. But while it was their opportunities that made these men fortunate, it was their own merit that enabled them to recognize these opportunities and turn them to account, to the glory and prosperity of their country.<br /><br />They who come to the Princedom, as these did, by virtuous paths, acquire with difficulty, but keep with ease. The difficulties which they have in acquiring arise mainly from the new laws and institutions which they are forced to introduce in founding and securing their government. And let it be noted that there is no more delicate matter to take in hand, nor more dangerous to conduct, nor more doubtful in its success, than to set up as a leader in the introduction of changes. For he who innovates will have for his enemies all those who are well off under the existing order of things, and only lukewarm supporters in those who might be better off under the new. This lukewarm temper arises partly from the fear of adversaries who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of mankind, who will never admit the merit of anything new, until they have seen it proved by the event. The result, however, is that whenever the enemies of change make an attack, they do so with all the zeal of partisans, while the others defend themselves so feebly as to endanger both themselves and their cause.<br /><br />But to get a clearer understanding of this part of our subject, we must look whether these innovators can stand alone, or whether they depend for aid upon others; in other words, whether to carry out their ends they must resort to entreaty, or can prevail by force. In the former case they always fare badly and bring nothing to a successful issue; but when they depend upon their own resources and can employ force, they seldom fail. Hence it comes that all armed Prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed Prophets have been destroyed.<br /><br />For, besides what has been said, it should be borne in mind that the temper of the multitude is fickle, and that while it is easy to persuade them of a thing, it is hard to fix them in that persuasion. Wherefore, matters should be so ordered that when men no longer believe of their own accord, they may be compelled to believe by force. Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus could never have made their ordinances be observed for any length of time had they been unarmed, as was the case, in our own days, with the Friar Girolamo Savonarola, whose new institutions came to nothing so soon as the multitude began to waver in their faith; since he had not the means to keep those who had been believers steadfast in their belief, or to make unbelievers believe.<br /><br />Such persons, therefore, have great difficulty in carrying out their designs; but all their difficulties are on the road, and may be overcome by courage. Having conquered these, and coming to be held in reverence, and having destroyed all who were jealous of their influence, they remain powerful, safe, honoured, and prosperous.<br /><br />To the great examples cited above, I would add one other, of less note indeed, but assuredly bearing some proportion to them, and which may stand for all others of a like character. I mean the example of Hiero the Syracusan. He from a private station rose to be Prince of Syracuse, and he too was indebted to Fortune only for his opportunity. For the Syracusans being oppressed, chose him to be their Captain, which office he so discharged as deservedly to be made their King. For even while a private citizen his merit was so remarkable, that one who writes of him says, he lacked nothing that a King should have save the Kingdom. Doing away with the old army, he organized a new, abandoned existing alliances and assumed new allies, and with an army and allies of his own, was able on that foundation to build what superstructure he pleased; having trouble enough in acquiring, but none in preserving what he had acquired.<br /><br />'", "id": 103, "section_id": 125},{"content": " '<b>Chapter VII: Of New Princedoms Acquired By the Aid of Others and By Good Fortune<br /></b><br />They who from a private station become Princes by mere good fortune, do so with little trouble, but have much trouble to maintain themselves. They meet with no hindrance on their way, being carried as it were on wings to their destination, but all their difficulties overtake them when they alight. Of this class are those on whom States are conferred either in return for money, or through the favour of him who confers them; as it happened to many in the Greek cities of Ionia and the Hellespont to be made Princes by Darius, that they might hold these cities for his security and glory; and as happened in the case of those Emperors who, from privacy, attained the Imperial dignity by corrupting the army. Such Princes are wholly dependent on the favour and fortunes of those who have made them great, than which supports none could be less stable or secure; and they lack both the knowledge and the power that would enable them to maintain their position. They lack the knowledge, because unless they have great parts and force of character, it is not to be expected that having always lived in a private station they should have learned how to command. They lack the power, since they cannot look for support from attached and faithful troops. Moreover, States suddenly acquired, like all else that is produced and that grows up rapidly, can never have such root or hold as that the first storm which strikes them shall not overthrow them; unless, indeed, as I have said already, they who thus suddenly become Princes have a capacity for learning quickly how to defend what Fortune has placed in their lap, and can lay those foundations after they rise which by others are laid before.<br /><br />Of each of these methods of becoming a Prince, namely, by merit and by good fortune, I shall select an instance from times within my own recollection, and shall take the cases of Francesco Sforza and Cesare Borgia. By suitable measures and singular ability, Francesco Sforza rose from privacy to be Duke of Milan, preserving with little trouble what it cost him infinite efforts to gain. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, vulgarly spoken of as Duke Valentino, obtained his Princedom through the favourable fortunes of his father, and with these lost it, although, so far as in him lay, he used every effort and practised every expedient that a prudent and able man should, who desires to strike root in a State given him by the arms and fortune of another. For, as I have already said, he who does not lay his foundations at first, may, if he be of great parts, succeed in laying them afterwards, though with inconvenience to the builder and risk to the building. And if we consider the various measures taken by Duke Valentino, we shall perceive how broad were the foundations he had laid whereon to rest his future power.<br /><br />These I think it not superfluous to examine, since I know not what lessons I could teach a new Prince, more useful than the example of his actions. And if the measures taken by him did not profit him in the end, it was through no fault of his, but from the extraordinary and extreme malignity of Fortune.<br /><br />In his efforts to aggrandize the Duke his son, Alexander VI had to face many difficulties, both immediate and remote. In the first place, he saw no way to make him Lord of any State which was not a State of the Church, while, if he sought to take for him a State belonging to the Church, he knew that the Duke of Milan and the Venetians would withhold their consent; Faenza and Rimini being already under the protection of the latter. Further, he saw that the arms of Italy, and those more especially of which he might have availed himself, were in the hands of men who had reason to fear his aggrandizement, that is, of the Orsini, the Colonnesi, and their followers. These therefore he could not trust. It was consequently necessary that the existing order of things should be changed, and the States of Italy thrown into confusion, in order that he might safely make himself master of some part of them; and this became easy for him when he found that the Venetians, moved by other causes, were plotting to bring the French once more into Italy. This design he accordingly did not oppose, but furthered by annulling the first marriage of the French King.<br /><br />King Louis therefore came into Italy at the instance of the Venetians, and with the consent of Pope Alexander, and no sooner was he in Milan than the Pope got troops from him to aid him in his enterprise against Romagna, which Province, moved by the reputation of the French arms, at once submitted. After thus obtaining possession of Romagna, and after quelling the Colonnesi, Duke Valentino was desirous to follow up and extend his conquests. Two causes, however, held him back, namely, the doubtful fidelity of his own forces, and the waywardness of France. For he feared that the Orsini, of whose arms he had made use, might fail him, and not merely prove a hindrance to further acquisitions, but take from him what he had gained, and that the King might serve him the same turn. How little he could count on the Orsini was made plain when, after the capture of Faenza, he turned his arms against Bologna, and saw how reluctantly they took part in that enterprise. The King&rsquo;s mind he understood, when, after seizing on the Dukedom of Urbino, he was about to attack Tuscany; from which design Louis compelled him to desist. Whereupon the Duke resolved to depend no longer on the arms or fortune of others. His first step, therefore, was to weaken the factions of the Orsini and Colonnesi in Rome. Those of their following who were of good birth, he gained over by making them his own gentlemen, assigning them a liberal provision, and conferring upon them commands and appointments suited to their rank; so that in a few months their old partisan attachments died out, and the hopes of all rested on the Duke alone.<br /><br />He then awaited an occasion to crush the chiefs of the Orsini, for those of the house of Colonna he had already scattered, and a good opportunity presenting itself, he turned it to the best account. For when the Orsini came at last to see that the greatness of the Duke and the Church involved their ruin, they assembled a council at Magione in the Perugian territory, whence resulted the revolt of Urbino, commotions in Romagna, and an infinity of dangers to the Duke, all of which he overcame with the help of France. His credit thus restored, the Duke trusting no longer either to the French or to any other foreign aid, that he might not have to confront them openly, resorted to stratagem, and was so well able to dissemble his designs, that the Orsini, through the mediation of Signor Paolo (whom he failed not to secure by every friendly attention, furnishing him with clothes, money, and horses), were so won over as to be drawn in their simplicity into his hands at Sinigaglia. When the leaders were thus disposed of, and their followers made his friends, the Duke had laid sufficiently good foundations for his future power, since he held all Romagna together with the Dukedom of Urbino, and had ingratiated himself with the entire population of these States, who now began to see that they were well off.<br /><br />And since this part of his conduct merits both attention and imitation, I shall not pass it over in silence. After the Duke had taken Romagna, finding that it had been ruled by feeble Lords, who thought more of plundering than correcting their subjects, and gave them more cause for division than for union, so that the country was overrun with robbery, tumult, and every kind of outrage, he judged it necessary, with a view to render it peaceful and obedient to his authority, to provide it with a good government. Accordingly he set over it Messer Remiro d&rsquo;Orco, a stern and prompt ruler, who being entrusted with the fullest powers, in a very short time, and with much credit to himself, restored it to tranquillity and order. But afterwards apprehending that such unlimited authority might become odious, the Duke decided that it was no longer needed, and established in the centre of the Province a civil Tribunal, with an excellent President, in which every town was represented by its advocate. And knowing that past severities had generated ill-feeling against himself, in order to purge the minds of the people and gain their good-will, he sought to show them that any cruelty which had been done had not originated, with him, but in the harsh disposition of his minister. Availing himself of the pretext which this afforded, he one morning caused Remiro to be beheaded, and exposed in the market place of Cesena with a block and bloody axe by his side. The barbarity of which spectacle at once astounded and satisfied the populace.<br /><br />But, returning to the point whence we diverged, I say that the Duke, finding himself fairly strong and in a measure secured against present dangers, being furnished with arms of his own choosing and having to a great extent got rid of those which, if left near him, might have caused him trouble, had to consider, if he desired to follow up his conquests, how he was to deal with France, since he saw he could expect no further support from King Louis, whose eyes were at last opened to his mistake. He therefore began to look about for new alliances, and to waver in his adherence to the French, then occupied with their expedition into the kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards, at that time laying siege to Gaeta; his object being to secure himself against France; and in this he would soon have succeeded had Alexander lived.<br /><br />Such was the line he took to meet present exigencies. As regards the future, he had to apprehend that a new Head of the Church might not be his friend, and might even seek to deprive him of what Alexander had given. This he thought to provide against in four ways. First, by exterminating all who were of kin to those Lords whom he had despoiled of their possessions, that they might not become instruments in the hands of a new Pope. Second, by gaining over all the Roman nobles, so as to be able with their help to put a bridle, as the saying is, in the Pope&rsquo;s mouth. Third, by bringing the college of Cardinals, so far as he could, under his control. And fourth, by establishing his authority so firmly before his father&rsquo;s death, as to be able by himself to withstand the shock of a first onset.<br /><br />Of these measures, at the time when Alexander died, he had already effected three, and had almost carried out the forth. For of the Lords whose possessions he had usurped, he had put to death all whom he could reach, and very few had escaped. He had gained over the Roman nobility, and had the majority in the College of Cardinals on his side.<br /><br />As to further acquisitions, his design was to make himself master of Tuscany. He was already in possession of Perugia and Piombino, and had assumed the protectorship of Pisa, on which city he was about to spring; taking no heed of France, as indeed he no longer had occasion, since the French had been deprived of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards under circumstances which made it necessary for both nations to buy his friendship. Pisa taken, Lucca and Siena would soon have yielded, partly through jealousy of Florence, partly through fear, and the position of the Florentines must then have been desperate.<br /><br />Had he therefore succeeded in these designs, as he was succeeding in that very year in which Alexander died, he would have won such power and reputation that he might afterwards have stood alone, relying on his own strength and resources, without being beholden to the power and fortune of others. But Alexander died five years from the time he first unsheathed the sword, leaving his son with the State of Romagna alone consolidated, with all the rest unsettled, between two powerful hostile armies, and sick almost to death. And yet such were the fire and courage of the Duke, he knew so well how men must either be conciliated or crushed, and so solid were the foundations he had laid in that brief period, that had these armies not been upon his back, or had he been in sound health, he must have surmounted every difficulty.<br /><br />How strong his foundations were may be seen from this, that Romagna waited for him for more than a month; and that although half dead, he remained in safety in Rome, where though the Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini came to attack him, they met with no success. Moreover, since he was able if not to make whom he liked Pope, at least to prevent the election of any whom he disliked, had he been in health at the time when Alexander died, all would have been easy for him. But he told me himself on the day on which Julius II was created, that he had foreseen and provided for everything else that could happen on his father&rsquo;s death, but had never anticipated that when his father died he too should be at death&rsquo;s-door.<br /><br />Taking all these actions of the Duke together, I can find no fault with him; nay, it seems to me reasonable to put him forward, as I have done, as a pattern for all such as rise to power by good fortune and the help of others. For with his great spirit and high aims he could not act otherwise than he did, and nothing but the shortness of his father&rsquo;s life and his own illness prevented the success of his designs. Whoever, therefore, on entering a new Princedom, judges it necessary to rid himself of enemies, to conciliate friends, to prevail by force or fraud, to make himself feared yet not hated by his subjects, respected and obeyed by his soldiers, to crush those who can or ought to injure him, to introduce changes in the old order of things, to be at once severe and affable, magnanimous and liberal, to do away with a mutinous army and create a new one, to maintain relations with Kings and Princes on such a footing that they must see it for their interest to aid him, and dangerous to offend, can find no brighter example than in the actions of this Prince.<br /><br />The one thing for which he may be blamed was the creation of Pope Julius II, in respect of whom he chose badly. Because, as I have said already, though he could not secure the election he desired, he could have prevented any other; and he ought never to have consented to the creation of any one of those Cardinals whom he had injured, or who on becoming Pope would have reason to fear him; for fear is as dangerous an enemy as resentment. Those whom he had offended were, among others, San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna, San Giorgio, and Ascanio; all the rest, excepting d&rsquo;Amboise and the Spanish Cardinals (the latter from their connexion and obligations, the former from the power he derived through his relations with the French Court), would on assuming the Pontificate have had reason to fear him. The duke, therefore, ought, in the first place, to have laboured for the creation of a Spanish Pope; failing in which, he should have agreed to the election of d&rsquo;Amboise, but never to that of San Pietro ad Vincula. And he deceives himself who believes that with the great, recent benefits cause old wrongs to be forgotten.<br /><br />The Duke, therefore, erred in the part he took in this election; and his error was the cause of his ultimate downfall.<br /><b><br /></b>'", "id": 104, "section_id": 126},{"content": " '<p><b>Chapter VIII: Of Those Who By Their Crimes Come to Be Princes</b><br /></p>\\r\\n<p><br /></p>\\r\\n<p>But since from privacy a man may also rise to be a Prince in one orother of two ways, neither of which can be referred wholly either tomerit or to fortune, it is fit that I notice them here, though one ofthem may fall to be discussed more fully in treating of Republics.</p>\\r\\n<p>The ways I speak of are, first, when the ascent to power is made bypaths of wickedness and crime; and second, when a private personbecomes ruler of his country by the favour of his fellow-citizens.

Son of apotter, through all the stages of his fortunes he led a foul life. Hisvices, however, were conjoined with so great vigour both of mind andbody, that becoming a soldier, he rose through the various grades ofthe service to be Praetor of Syracuse. Once established in that post,he resolved to make himself Prince, and to hold by violence and withoutobligation to others the authority which had been spontaneouslyentrusted to him. Accordingly, after imparting his design to Hamilcar,who with the Carthaginian armies was at that time waging war in Sicily,he one morning assembled the people and senate of Syracuse as though toconsult with them on matters of public moment, and on a preconcertedsignal caused his soldiers to put to death all the senators, and thewealthiest of the commons. These being thus got rid of, he assumed andretained possession of the sovereignty without opposition on the partof the people; and although twice defeated by the Carthaginians, andafterwards besieged, he was able not only to defend his city, butleaving a part of his forces for its protection, to invade Africa withthe remainder, and so in a short time to raise the siege of Syracuse,reducing the Carthaginians to the utmost extremities, and compellingthem to make terms whereby they abandoned Sicily to him and confinedthemselves to Africa.</p>\\r\\n<p>Whoever examines this man&rsquo;s actions and achievements will discoverlittle or nothing in them which can be ascribed to Fortune, seeing, ashas already been said, that it was not through the favour of any, butby the regular steps of the military service, gained at the cost of athousand hardships and hazards, he reached the princedom which heafterwards maintained by so many daring and dangerous enterprises.Still, to slaughter fellow-citizens, to betray friends, to be devoid ofhonour, pity, and religion, cannot be counted as merits, for these aremeans which may lead to power, but which confer no glory. Wherefore, ifin respect of the valour with which he encountered and extricatedhimself from difficulties, and the constancy of his spirit insupporting and conquering adverse fortune, there seems no reason tojudge him inferior to the greatest captains that have ever lived, hisunbridled cruelty and inhumanity, together with his countless crimes,forbid us to number him with the greatest men; but, at any rate, wecannot attribute to Fortune or to merit what he accomplished withouteither.</p>\\r\\n<p>In our own times, during the papacy of Alexander VI, Oliverotto ofFermo,. who some years before had been left an orphan, and had beenbrought up by his maternal uncle Giovanni Fogliani, was sent whilestill a lad to serve under Paolo Vitelli, in the expectation that athorough training under that commander might qualify him for high rankas a soldier. After the death of Paolo, he served under his brotherVitellozzo, and in a very short time, being of a quick wit, hardy andresolute, he became one of the first soldiers of his company. Butthinking it beneath him to serve under others, with the countenance ofthe Vitelleschi and the connivance of certain citizens of Fermo whopreferred the slavery to the freedom of their country, he formed thedesign to seize on that town.</p>\\r\\n<p>He accordingly wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that after many years ofabsence from home, he desired to see him and his native city once more,and to look a little into the condition of his patrimony; and as hisone endeavour had been to make himself a name, in order that hisfellow-citizens might see his time had not been mis-spent, he proposedto return honourably attended by a hundred horsemen from among his ownfriends and followers; and he begged Giovanni graciously to arrange forhis reception by the citizens of Fermo with corresponding marks ofdistinction, as this would be creditable not only to himself, but alsoto the uncle who had brought him up.</p>\\r\\n<p>Giovanni accordingly, did not fail in any proper attention to hisnephew, but caused him to be splendidly received by hisfellow-citizens, and lodged him in his house; where Oliverotto havingpassed some days, and made the necessary arrangements for carrying outhis wickedness, gave a formal banquet, to which he invited his uncleand all the first men of Fermo. When the repast and the otherentertainments proper to such an occasion had come to an end,Oliverotto artfully turned the conversation to matters of graveinterest, by speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and Cesare hisson, and of their enterprises; and when Giovanni and the others werereplying to what he said, he suddenly rose up, observing that thesewere matters to be discussed in a more private place, and so withdrewto another chamber; whither his uncle and all the other citizensfollowed him, and where they had no sooner seated themselves, thansoldiers rushing out from places of concealment put Giovanni and allthe rest to death.</p>\\r\\n<p>After this butchery, Oliverotto mounted his horse, rode through thestreets, and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace, so that allwere constrained by fear to yield obedience and accept a government ofwhich he made himself the head. And all who from being disaffected werelikely to stand in his way, he put to death, while he strengthenedhimself with new ordinances, civil and military, to such purpose, thatfor the space of a year during which he retained the Princedom, he notmerely kept a firm hold of the city, but grew formidable to all hisneighbours. And it would have been as impossible to unseat him as itwas to unseat Agathocles, had he not let himself be overreached byCesare Borgia on the occasion when, as has already been told, theOrsini and Vitelli were entrapped at Sinigaglia; where he too beingtaken, one year after the commission of his parricidal crime, wasstrangled along with Vitellozzo, whom he had assumed for his master invillany as in valour.</p>\\r\\n<p>It may be asked how Agathocles and some like him, after numberlessacts of treachery and cruelty, have been able to live long in their owncountry in safety, and to defend themselves from foreign enemies,without being plotted against by their fellow-citizens, whereas, manyothers, by reason of their cruelty, have failed to maintain theirposition even in peaceful times, not to speak of the perilous times ofwar. I believe that this results from cruelty being well orill-employed. Those cruelties we may say are well employed, if it bepermitted to speak well of things evil, which are done once for allunder the necessity of self-preservation, and are not afterwardspersisted in, but so far as possible modified to the advantage of thegoverned. Ill-employed cruelties, on the other hand, are those whichfrom small beginnings increase rather than diminish with time. They whofollow the first of these methods, may, by the grace of God and man,find, as did Agathocles, that their condition is not desperate; but byno possibility can the others maintain themselves.</p>\\r\\n<p>Hence we may learn the lesson that on seizing a state, the usurpershould make haste to inflict what injuries he must, at a stroke, thathe may not have to renew them daily, but be enabled by theirdiscontinuance to reassure men&rsquo;s minds, and afterwards win them over bybenefits. Whosoever, either through timidity or from following badcounsels, adopts a contrary course, must keep the sword always drawn,and can put no trust in his subjects, who suffering from continued andconstantly renewed severities, will never yield him their confidence.Injuries, therefore, should be inflicted all at once, that their illsavour being less lasting may the less offend; whereas, benefits shouldbe conferred little by little, that so they may be more fully relished.</p>\\r\\n<p>But, before all things, a Prince should so live with his subjectsthat no vicissitude of good or evil fortune shall oblige him to alterhis behaviour; because, if a need to change come through adversity, itis then too late to resort to severity; while any leniency you may usewill be thrown away, for it will be seen to be compulsory and gain youno thanks.</p>\\r\\n<p><a></a></p>\\r\\n<h2><span class=\"&quot;&quot;editsection&quot;&quot;\">[<a title=\"&quot;&quot;Edit&quot;\" chapter=\"&quot;chapter&quot;\" of=\"&quot;of&quot;\" the=\"&quot;the&quot;\" civil=\"&quot;civil&quot;\">edit</a>]</span> <span class=\"&quot;&quot;mw-headline&quot;&quot;\"></span></h2>'", "id": 105, "section_id": 127},{"content": " '<b>Chapter IX: Of the Civil Princedom<br /></b><br />I come now to the second case, namely, of the leading citizen who, not by crimes or violence, but by the favour of his fellow-citizens is made Prince of his country. This may be called a Civil Princedom, and its attainment depends not wholly on merit, nor wholly on good fortune, but rather on what may be termed a fortunate astuteness. I say then that the road to this Princedom lies either through the favour of the people or of the nobles. For in every city are to be found these two opposed humours having their origin in this, that the people desire not to be domineered over or oppressed by the nobles, while the nobles desire to oppress and domineer over the people. And from these two contrary appetites there arises in cities one of three results, a Princedom, or Liberty, or Licence. A Princedom is created either by the people or by the nobles, according as one or other of these factions has occasion for it. For when the nobles perceive that they cannot withstand the people, they set to work to magnify the reputation of one of their number, and make him their Prince, to the end that under his shadow they may be enabled to indulge their desires. The people, on the other hand, when they see that they cannot make head against the nobles, invest a single citizen with all their influence and make him Prince, that they may have the shelter of his authority.<br /><br />He who is made Prince by the favour of the nobles, has greater difficulty to maintain himself than he who comes to the Princedom by aid of the people, since he finds many about him who think themselves as good as he, and whom, on that account, he cannot guide or govern as he would. But he who reaches the Princedom by the popular support, finds himself alone, with none, or but a very few about him who are not ready to obey. Moreover, the demands of the nobles cannot be satisfied with credit to the Prince, nor without injury to others, while those of the people well may, the aim of the people being more honourable than that of the nobles, the latter seeking to oppress, the former not to be oppressed. Add to this, that a Prince can never secure himself against a disaffected people, their number being too great, while he may against a disaffected nobility, since their number is small. The worst that a Prince need fear from a disaffected people is, that they may desert him, whereas when the nobles are his enemies he has to fear not only that they may desert him, but also that they may turn against him; because, as they have greater craft and foresight, they always choose their time to suit their safety, and seek favour with the side they think will win. Again, a Prince must always live with the same people, but need not always live with the same nobles, being able to make and unmake these from day to day, and give and take away their authority at his pleasure.<br /><br />But to make this part of the matter clearer, I say that as regards the nobles there is this first distinction to be made. They either so govern their conduct as to bind themselves wholly to your fortunes, or they do not. Those who so bind themselves, and who are not grasping, should be loved and honoured. As to those who do not so bind themselves, there is this further distinction. For the most part they are held back by pusillanimity and a natural defect of courage, in which case you should make use of them, and of those among them more especially who are prudent, for they will do you honour in prosperity, and in adversity give you no cause for fear. But where they abstain from attaching themselves to you of set purpose and for ambitious ends, it is a sign that they are thinking more of themselves than of you, and against such men a Prince should be on his guard, and treat them as though they were declared enemies, for in his adversity they will always help to ruin him.<br /><br />He who becomes a Prince through the favour of the people should always keep on good terms with them; which it is easy for him to do, since all they ask is not to be oppressed. But he who against the will of the people is made a Prince by the favour of the nobles, must, above all things, seek to conciliate the people, which he readily may by taking them under his protection. For since men who are well treated by one whom they expected to treat them ill, feel the more beholden to their benefactor, the people will at once become better disposed to such a Prince when he protects them, than if he owed his Princedom to them.<br /><br />There are many ways in which a Prince may gain the good-will of the people, but, because these vary with circumstances, no certain rule can be laid down respecting them, and I shall, therefore, say no more about them. But this is the sum of the matter, that it is essential for a Prince to be on a friendly footing with his people, since otherwise, he will have no resource in adversity. Nabis, Prince of Sparta, was attacked by the whole hosts of Greece, and by a Roman army flushed with victory, and defended his country and crown against them; and when danger approached, there were but few of his subjects against whom he needed to guard himself, whereas had the people been hostile, this would not have been enough.<br /><br />And what I affirm let no one controvert by citing the old saw that &rsquo;he who builds on the people builds on mire,&rsquo; for that may be true of a private citizen who presumes on his favour with the people, and counts on being rescued by them when overpowered by his enemies or by the magistrates. In such cases a man may often find himself deceived, as happened to the Gracchi in Rome, and in Florence to Messer Giorgio Scali. But when he who builds on the people is a Prince capable of command, of a spirit not to be cast down by ill-fortune, who, while he animates the whole community by his courage and bearing, neglects no prudent precaution, he will not find himself betrayed by the people, but will be seen to have laid his foundations well.<br /><br />The most critical juncture for Princedoms of this kind, is at the moment when they are about to pass from the popular to the absolute form of government: and as these Princes exercise their authority either directly or through the agency of the magistrates, in the latter case their position is weaker and more hazardous, since they are wholly in the power of those citizens to whom the magistracies are entrusted, who can, and especially in difficult times, with the greatest ease deprive them of their authority, either by opposing, or by not obeying them. And in times of peril it is too late for a Prince to assume to himself an absolute authority, for the citizens and subjects who are accustomed to take their orders from the magistrates, will not when dangers threaten take them from the Prince, so that at such seasons there will always be very few in whom he can trust. Such Princes, therefore, must not build on what they see in tranquil times when the citizens feel the need of the State. For then every one is ready to run, to promise, and, danger of death being remote, even to die for the State. But in troubled times, when the State has need of its citizens, few of them are to be found. And the risk of the experiment is the greater in that it can only be made once. Wherefore, a wise Prince should devise means whereby his subjects may at all times, whether favourable or adverse, feel the need of the State and of him, and then they will always be faithful to him.<br /><b><br /></b>'", "id": 106, "section_id": 128},{"content": " '<b>Chapter X: How the Strength of All Princedoms Should Be Measured</b><br /><br />In examining the character of these Princedoms, another circumstance has to be considered, namely, whether the Prince is strong enough, if occasion demands, to stand alone, or whether he needs continual help from others. To make the matter clearer, I pronounce those to be able to stand alone who, with the men and money at their disposal, can get together an army fit to take the field against any assailant; and, conversely, I judge those to be in constant need of help who cannot take the field against their enemies, but are obliged to retire behind their walls, and to defend themselves there. Of the former I have already spoken, and shall speak again as occasion may require. As to the latter there is nothing to be said, except to exhort such Princes to strengthen and fortify the towns in which they dwell, and take no heed of the country outside. For whoever has thoroughly fortified his town, and put himself on such a footing with his subjects as I have already indicated and shall hereafter speak of, will always be attacked with much circumspection; for men are always averse to enterprises that are attended with difficulty, and it is impossible not to foresee difficulties in attacking a Prince whose town is strongly fortified and who is not hated by his subjects.<br /><br />The towns of Germany enjoy great freedom. Having little territory, they render obedience to the Emperor only when so disposed, fearing neither him nor any other neighbouring power. For they are so fortified that it is plain to every one that it would be a tedious and difficult task to reduce them, since all of them are protected by moats and suitable ramparts, are well supplied with artillery, and keep their public magazines constantly stored with victual, drink and fuel, enough to last them for a year. Besides which, in order to support the poorer class of citizens without public loss, they lay in a common stock of materials for these to work on for a year, in the handicrafts which are the life and sinews of such cities, and by which the common people live. Moreover, they esteem military exercises and have many regulations for their maintenance.<br /><br />A Prince, therefore, who has a strong city, and who does not make himself hated, can not be attacked, or should he be so, his assailant will come badly off; since human affairs are so variable that it is almost impossible for any one to keep an army posted in leaguer for a whole year without interruption of some sort. Should it be objected that if the citizens have possessions outside the town, and see them burned, they will lose patience, and that self-interest, together with the hardships of a protracted siege, will cause them to forget their loyalty; I answer that a capable and courageous Prince will always overcome these difficulties, now, by holding out hopes to his subjects that the evil will not be of long continuance; now, by exciting their fears of the enemy&rsquo;s cruelty; and, again, by dexterously silencing those who seem to him too forward in their complaints. Moreover, it is to be expected that the enemy will burn and lay waste the country immediately on their arrival, at a time when men&rsquo;s minds are still heated and resolute for defence. And for this very reason the Prince ought the less to fear, because after a few days, when the first ardour has abated, the injury is already done and suffered, and cannot be undone; and the people will now, all the more readily, make common cause with their Prince from his seeming to be under obligations to them, their houses having been burned and their lands wasted in his defence. For it is the nature of men to incur obligation as much by the benefits they render as by those they receive.<br /><br />Wherefore, if the whole matter be well considered, it ought not to be difficult for a prudent Prince, both at the outset and afterwards, to maintain the spirits of his subjects during a siege; provided always that victuals and other means of defence do not run short.<br /><br />'", "id": 107, "section_id": 129},{"content": " '<b>Chapter XI: Of Ecclesiastical Princedoms</b><br /><br />It now only remains for me to treat of Ecclesiastical Princedoms, all the difficulties in respect of which precede their acquisition. For they are acquired by merit or good fortune, but are maintained without either; being upheld by the venerable ordinances of Religion, which are all of such a nature and efficacy that they secure the authority of their Princes in whatever way they may act or live. These Princes alone have territories which they do not defend, and subjects whom they do not govern; yet their territories are not taken from them through not being defended, nor are their subjects concerned at not being governed, or led to think of throwing off their allegiance; nor is it in their power to do so. Accordingly these Princedoms alone are secure and happy. But inasmuch as they are sustained by agencies of a higher nature than the mind of man can reach, I forbear to speak of them: for since they are set up and supported by God himself, he would be a rash and presumptuous man who should venture to discuss them.<br /><br />Nevertheless, should any one ask me how it comes about that the temporal power of the Church, which before the time of Alexander was looked on with contempt by all the Potentates of Italy, and not only by those so styling themselves, but by every Baron and Lordling however insignificant, has now reached such a pitch of greatness that the King of France trembles before it, and that it has been able to drive him out of Italy and to crush the Venetians; though the causes be known, it seems to me not superfluous to call them in some measure to recollection.<br /><br />Before Charles of France passed into Italy, that country was under the control of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. Two chief objects had to be kept in view by all these powers: first, that no armed foreigner should be allowed to invade Italy; second, that no one of their own number should be suffered to extend his territory. Those whom it was especially needed to guard against, were the Pope and the Venetians. To hold back the Venetians it was necessary that all the other States should combine, as was done for the defence of Ferrara; while to restrain the Pope, use was made of the Roman Barons, who being divided into two factions, the Orsini and Colonnesi, had constant cause for feud with one another, and standing with arms in their hands under the very eyes of the Pontiff, kept the Popedom feeble and insecure.<br /><br />And although there arose from time to time a courageous Pope like Sixtus, neither his prudence nor his good fortune could free him from these embarrassments. The cause whereof was the shortness of the lives of the Popes. For in the ten years, which was the average duration of a Pope&rsquo;s life, he could barely succeed in humbling one of these factions; so that if, for instance, one Pope had almost exterminated the Colonnesi, he was followed by another, who being the enemy of the Orsini had no time to rid himself of them, but so far from completing the destruction of the Colonnesi, restored them to life. This led to the temporal authority of the Popes being little esteemed in Italy.<br /><br />Then came Alexander VI, who more than any of his predecessors showed what a Pope could effect with money and arms, achieving by the instrumentality of Duke Valentino, and by taking advantage of the coming of the French into Italy, all those successes which I have already noticed in speaking of the actions of the Duke. And although his object was to aggrandize, not the Church but the Duke, what he did turned to the advantage of the Church, which after his death, and after the Duke had been put out of the way, became the heir of his labours.<br /><br />After him came Pope Julius, who found the Church strengthened by the possession of the whole of Romagna, and the Roman Barons exhausted and their factions shattered under the blows of Pope Alexander. He found also a way opened for the accumulation of wealth, which before the time of Alexander no one had followed. These advantages Julius not only used but added to. He undertook the conquest of Bologna, the overthrow of the Venetians, and the expulsion of the French from Italy; in all which enterprises he succeeded, and with the greater glory to himself in that whatever he did, was done to strengthen the Church and not to aggrandize any private person. He succeeded, moreover, in keeping the factions of the Orsini and Colonnesi within the same limits as he found them; and, though some seeds of insubordination may still have been left among them, two causes operated to hold them in check; first, the great power of the Church, which overawed them, and second, their being without Cardinals, who had been the cause of all their disorders. For these factions while they have Cardinals among them can never be at rest, since it is they who foment dissension both in Rome and out of it, in which the Barons are forced to take part, the ambition of the Prelates thus giving rise to tumult and discord among the Barons.<br /><br />His Holiness, Pope Leo, has consequently found the Papacy most powerful; and from him we may hope, that as his predecessors made it great with arms, he will render it still greater and more venerable by his benignity and other countless virtues.<br /><br />'", "id": 108, "section_id": 130},{"content": " '<b>Chapter XII: How Many Different Kinds of Soldiers There Are, and of Mercenaries</b><br /><br />Having spoken particularly of all the various kinds of Princedom whereof at the outset I proposed to treat, considered in some measure what are the causes of their strength and weakness, and pointed out the methods by which men commonly seek to acquire them, it now remains that I should discourse generally concerning the means for attack and defence of which each of these different kinds of Princedom may make use.<br /><br />I have already said that a Prince must lay solid foundations, since otherwise he will inevitably be destroyed. Now the main foundations of all States, whether new, old, or mixed, are good laws and good arms. But since you cannot have the former without the latter, and where you have the latter, are likely to have the former, I shall here omit all discussion on the subject of laws, and speak only of arms.<br /><br />I say then that the arms wherewith a Prince defends his State are either his own subjects, or they are mercenaries, or they are auxiliaries, or they are partly one and partly another. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are at once useless and dangerous, and he who holds his State by means of mercenary troops can never be solidly or securely seated. For such troops are disunited, ambitious, insubordinate, treacherous, insolent among friends, cowardly before foes, and without fear of God or faith with man. Whenever they are attacked defeat follows; so that in peace you are plundered by them, in war by your enemies. And this because they have no tie or motive to keep them in the field beyond their paltry pay, in return for which it would be too much to expect them to give their lives. They are ready enough, therefore, to be your soldiers while you are at peace, but when war is declared they make off and disappear. I ought to have little difficulty in getting this believed, for the present ruin of Italy is due to no other cause than her having for many years trusted to mercenaries, who though heretofore they may have helped the fortunes of some one man, and made a show of strength when matched with one another, have always revealed themselves in their true colours so soon as foreign enemies appeared. Hence it was that Charles of France was suffered to conquer Italy with chalk; and he who said our sins were the cause, said truly, though it was not the sins he meant, but those which I have noticed. And as these were the sins of Princes, they it is who have paid the penalty.<br /><br />But I desire to demonstrate still more clearly the untoward character of these forces. Captains of mercenaries are either able men or they are not. If they are, you cannot trust them, since they will always seek their own aggrandizement, either by overthrowing you who are their master, or by the overthrow of others contrary to your desire. On the other hand, if your captain be not an able man the chances are you will be ruined. And if it be said that whoever has arms in his hands will act in the same way whether he be a mercenary or no, I answer that when arms have to be employed by a Prince or a Republic, the Prince ought to go in person to take command as captain, the Republic should send one of her citizens, and if he prove incapable should change him, but if he prove capable should by the force of the laws confine him within proper bounds. And we see from experience that both Princes and Republics when they depend on their own arms have the greatest success, whereas from employing mercenaries nothing but loss results. Moreover, a Republic trusting to her own forces, is with greater difficulty than one which relies on foreign arms brought to yield obedience to a single citizen. Rome and Sparta remained for ages armed and free. The Swiss are at once the best armed and the freest people in the world.<br /><br />Of mercenary arms in ancient times we have an example in the Carthaginians, who at the close of their first war with Rome, were well-nigh ruined by their hired troops, although these were commanded by Carthaginian citizens. So too, when, on the death of Epaminondas, the Thebans made Philip of Macedon captain of their army, after gaining a victory for them, he deprived them of their liberty. The Milanese, in like manner, when Duke Filippo died, took Francesco Sforza into their pay to conduct the war against the Venetians. But he, after defeating the enemy at Caravaggio, combined with them to overthrow the Milanese, his masters. His father too while in the pay of Giovanna, Queen of Naples, suddenly left her without troops, obliging her, in order to save her kingdom, to throw herself into the arms of the King of Aragon.<br /><br />And if it be said that in times past the Venetians and the Florentines have extended their dominions by means of these arms, and that their captains have served them faithfully, without seeking to make themselves their masters, I answer that in this respect the Florentines have been fortunate, because among those valiant captains who might have given them cause for fear, some have not been victorious, some have had rivals, and some have turned their ambition in other directions.<br /><br />Among those not victorious, was Giovanni Acuto, whose fidelity, since he was unsuccessful, was not put to the proof: but any one may see, that had he been victorious the Florentines must have been entirely in his hands. The Sforzas, again, had constant rivals in the Bracceschi, so that the one following was a check upon the other; moreover, the ambition of Francesco was directed against Milan, while that of Braccio was directed against the Church and the kingdom of Naples. Let us turn, however, to what took place lately. The Florentines chose for their captain Paolo Vitelli, a most prudent commander, who had raised himself from privacy to the highest renown in arms. Had he been successful in reducing Pisa, none can deny that the Florentines would have been completely in his power, for they would have been ruined had he gone over to their enemies, while if they retained him they must have submitted to his will.<br /><br />Again, as to the Venetians, if we consider the growth of their power, it will be seen that they conducted their affairs with glory and safety so long as their subjects of all ranks, gentle and simple alike, valiantly bore arms in their wars; as they did before they directed their enterprises landwards. But when they took to making war by land, they forsook those methods in which they excelled and were content to follow the customs of Italy.<br /><br />At first, indeed, in extending their possessions on the mainland, having as yet but little territory and being held in high repute, they had not much to fear from their captains; but when their territories increased, which they did under Carmagnola, they were taught their mistake. For as they had found him a most valiant and skillful leader when, under his command, they defeated the Duke of Milan, and, on the other hand, saw him slack in carrying on the war, they made up their minds that no further victories were to be had under him; and because, through fear of losing what they had gained, they could not discharge him, to secure themselves against him they were forced to put him to death. After him they have had for captains, Bartolommeo of Bergamo, Roberto of San Severino, the Count of Pitigliano, and the like, under whom their danger has not been from victories, but from defeats; as, for instance, at Vaila, where they lost in a single day what it had taken the efforts of eight hundred years to acquire. For the gains resulting from mercenary arms are slow, and late, and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and astounding.<br /><br />And since these examples have led me back to Italy, which for many years past has been defended by mercenary arms, I desire to go somewhat deeper into the matter, in order that the causes which led to the adoption of these arms being seen, they may the more readily be corrected. You are to understand, then, that when in these later times the Imperial control began to be rejected by Italy, and the temporal power of the Pope to be more thought of, Italy suddenly split up into a number of separate States. For many of the larger cities took up arms against their nobles, who, with the favour of the Emperor, had before kept them in subjection, and were supported by the Church with a view to add to her temporal authority: while in many others of these cities, private citizens became rulers. Hence Italy, having passed almost entirely into the hands of the Church and of certain Republics, the former made up of priests, the latter of citizens unfamiliar with arms, began to take foreigners into her pay.<br /><br />The first who gave reputation to this service was Alberigo of Conio in Romagna, from whose school of warlike training descended, among others, Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy; after whom came all those others who down to the present hour have held similar commands, and to whose merits we owe it that our country has been overrun by Charles, plundered by Louis, wasted by Ferdinand, and insulted by the Swiss.<br /><br />The first object of these mercenaries was to bring foot soldiers into disrepute, in order to enhance the merit of their own followers; and this they did, because lacking territory of their own and depending on their profession for their support, a few foot soldiers gave them no importance, while for a large number they were unable to provide. For these reasons they had recourse to horsemen, a less retinue of whom was thought to confer distinction, and could be more easily maintained. And the matter went to such a length, that in an army of twenty thousand men, not to thousand foot soldiers were to be found. Moreover, they spared no endeavour to relieve themselves and their men from fatigue and danger, not killing one another in battle, but making prisoners who were afterwards released without ransom. They would attack no town by night; those in towns would make no sortie by night against a besieging army. Their camps were without rampart or trench. They had no winter campaigns. All which arrangements were sanctioned by their military rules, contrived by them, as I have said already, to escape fatigue and danger; but the result of which has been to bring Italy into servitude and contempt.<br /><br />'", "id": 111, "section_id": 133},{"content": " '<b>Chapter XIV: Of the Duty of a Prince In Respect of Military Affairs</b><br /><br />A Prince, therefore, should have no care or thought but for war, and for the regulations and training it requires, and should apply himself exclusively to this as his peculiar province; for war is the sole art looked for in one who rules, and is of such efficacy that it not merely maintains those who are born Princes, but often enables men to rise to that eminence from a private station; while, on the other hand, we often see that when Princes devote themselves rather to pleasure than to arms, they lose their dominions. And as neglect of this art is the prime cause of such calamities, so to be a proficient in it is the surest way to acquire power. Francesco Sforza, from his renown in arms, rose from privacy to be Duke of Milan, while his descendants, seeking to avoid the hardships and fatigues of military life, from being Princes fell back into privacy. For among other causes of misfortune which your not being armed brings upon you, it makes you despised, and this is one of those reproaches against which, as shall presently be explained, a Prince ought most carefully to guard.<br /><br />Between an armed and an unarmed man no proportion holds, and it is contrary to reason to expect that the armed man should voluntarily submit to him who is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should stand secure among armed retainers. For with contempt on one side, and distrust on the other, it is impossible that men should work well together. Wherefore, as has already been said, a Prince who is ignorant of military affairs, besides other disadvantages, can neither be respected by his soldiers, nor can he trust them. A Prince, therefore, ought never to allow his attention to be diverted from warlike pursuits, and should occupy himself with them even more in peace than in war. This he can do in two ways, by practice or by study.<br /><br />As to the practice, he ought, besides keeping his soldiers well trained and disciplined, to be constantly engaged in the chase, that he may inure his body to hardships and fatigue, and gain at the same time a knowledge of places, by observing how the mountains slope, the valleys open, and the plains spread; acquainting himself with the characters of rivers and marshes, and giving the greatest attention to this subject. Such knowledge is useful to him in two ways; for first, he learns thereby to know his own country, and to understand better how it may be defended; and next, from his familiar acquaintance with its localities, he readily comprehends the character of other districts when obliged to observe them for the first time. For the hills, valleys, plains, rivers, and marshes of Tuscany, for example, have a certain resemblance to those elsewhere; so that from a knowledge of the natural features of that province, similar knowledge in respect of other provinces may readily be gained. The Prince who is wanting in this kind of knowledge, is wanting in the first qualification of a good captain for by it he is taught how to surprise an enemy, how to choose an encampment, how to lead his army on a march, how to array it for battle, and how to post it to the best advantage for a siege.<br /><br />Among the commendations which Philopoemon, Prince of the Achaians, has received from historians is this&mdash;that in times of peace he was always thinking of methods of warfare, so that when walking in the country with his friends he would often stop and talk with them on the subject. &lsquo;If the enemy,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;were posted on that hill, and we found ourselves here with our army, which of us would have the better position? How could we most safely and in the best order advance to meet them? If we had to retreat, what direction should we take? If they retired, how should we pursue?&rsquo; In this way he put to his friends, as he went along, all the contingencies that can befall an army. He listened to their opinions, stated his own, and supported them with reasons; and from his being constantly occupied with such meditations, it resulted, that when in actual command no complication could ever present itself with which he was not prepared to deal.<br /><br />As to the mental training of which we have spoken, a Prince should read histories, and in these should note the actions of great men, observe how they conducted themselves in their wars, and examine the causes of their victories and defeats, so as to avoid the latter and imitate them in the former. And above all, he should, as many great men of past ages have done, assume for his models those persons who before his time have been renowned and celebrated, whose deeds and achievements he should constantly keep in mind, as it is related that Alexander the Great sought to resemble Achilles, C&aelig;sar Alexander, and Scipio Cyrus. And any one who reads the life of this last-named hero, written by Xenophon, recognizes afterwards in the life of Scipio, how much this imitation was the source of his glory, and how nearly in his chastity, affability, kindliness, and generosity, he conformed to the character of Cyrus as Xenophon describes it.<br /><br />A wise Prince, therefore, should pursue such methods as these, never resting idle in times of peace, but strenuously seeking to turn them to account, so that he may derive strength from them in the hour of danger, and find himself ready should Fortune turn against him, to resist her blows.<br /><br />'", "id": 113, "section_id": 135},{"content": " '<b>Chapter XV: Of the Qualities In Respect of Which Men, and Most of all Princes, Are Praised or Blamed</b><br /><br />It now remains for us to consider what ought to be the conduct and bearing of a Prince in relation to his subjects and friends. And since I know that many have written on this subject, I fear it may be thought presumptuous in me to write of it also; the more so, because in my treatment of it, I depart from the views that others have taken.<br /><br />But since it is my object to write what shall be useful to whosoever understands it, it seems to me better to follow the real truth of things than an imaginary view of them. For many Republics and Princedoms have been imagined that were never seen or known to exist in reality. And the manner in which we live, and that in which we ought to live, are things so wide asunder, that he who quits the one to betake himself to the other is more likely to destroy than to save himself; since any one who would act up to a perfect standard of goodness in everything, must be ruined among so many who are not good. It is essential, therefore, for a Prince who desires to maintain his position, to have learned how to be other than good, and to use or not to use his goodness as necessity requires.<br /><br />Laying aside, therefore, all fanciful notions concerning a Prince, and considering those only that are true, I say that all men when they are spoken of, and Princes more than others from their being set so high, are characterized by some one of those qualities which attach either praise or blame. Thus one is accounted liberal, another miserly (which word I use, rather than avaricious, to denote the man who is too sparing of what is his own, avarice being the disposition to take wrongfully what is another&rsquo;s", "id": 114, "section_id": 136},{"content": " '<b>Chapter XVI: Of Liberality and Miserliness</b><br /><br />Beginning, then, with the first of the qualities above noticed, I say that it may be a good thing to be reputed liberal, but, nevertheless, that liberality without the reputation of it is hurtful; because, though it be worthily and rightly used, still if it be not known, you escape not the reproach of its opposite vice. Hence, to have credit for liberality with the world at large, you must neglect no circumstance of sumptuous display; the result being, that a Prince of a liberal disposition will consume his whole substance in things of this sort, and, after all, be obliged, if he would maintain his reputation for liberality, to burden his subjects with extraordinary taxes, and to resort to confiscations and all the other shifts whereby money is raised. But in this way he becomes hateful to his subjects, and growing impoverished is held in little esteem by any. So that in the end, having by his liberality offended many and obliged few, he is worse off than when he began, and is exposed to all his original dangers. Recognizing this, and endeavouring to retrace his steps, he at once incurs the infamy of miserliness.<br /><br />A Prince, therefore, since he cannot without injury to himself practise the virtue of liberality so that it may be known, will not, if he be wise, greatly concern himself though he be called miserly. Because in time he will come to be regarded as more and more liberal, when it is seen that through his parsimony his revenues are sufficient; that he is able to defend himself against any who make war on him; that he can engage in enterprises against others without burdening his subjects; and thus exercise liberality towards all from whom he does not take, whose number is infinite, while he is miserly in respect of those only to whom he does not give, whose number is few.<br /><br />In our own days we have seen no Princes accomplish great results save those who have been accounted miserly. All others have been ruined. Pope Julius II, after availing himself of his reputation for liberality to arrive at the Papacy, made no effort to preserve that reputation when making war on the King of France, but carried on all his numerous campaigns without levying from his subjects a single extraordinary tax, providing for the increased expenditure out of his long-continued savings. Had the present King of Spain been accounted liberal, he never could have engaged or succeeded in so many enterprises.<br /><br />A Prince, therefore, if he is enabled thereby to forbear from plundering his subjects, to defend himself, to escape poverty and contempt, and the necessity of becoming rapacious, ought to care little though he incur the reproach of miserliness, for this is one of those vices which enable him to reign.<br /><br />And should any object that C&aelig;sar by his liberality rose to power, and that many others have been advanced to the highest dignities from their having been liberal and so reputed, I reply, &lsquo;Either you are already a Prince or you seek to become one; in the former case liberality is hurtful, in the latter it is very necessary that you be thought liberal; C&aelig;sar was one of those who sought the sovereignty of Rome; but if after obtaining it he had lived on without retrenching his expenditure, he must have ruined the Empire.&rsquo; And if it be further urged that many Princes reputed to have been most liberal have achieved great things with their armies, I answer that a Prince spends either what belongs to himself and his subjects, or what belongs to others; and that in the former case he ought to be sparing, but in the latter ought not to refrain from any kind of liberality. Because for a Prince who leads his armies in person and maintains them by plunder, pillage, and forced contributions, dealing as he does with the property of others this liberality is necessary, since otherwise he would not be followed by his soldiers. Of what does not belong to you or to your subjects you should, therefore, be a lavish giver, as were Cyrus, C&aelig;sar, and Alexander; for to be liberal with the property of others does not take from your reputation, but adds to it. What injures you is to give away what is your own. And there is no quality so self-destructive as liberality; for while you practise it you lose the means whereby it can be practised, and become poor and despised, or else, to avoid poverty, you become rapacious and hated. For liberality leads to one or other of these two results, against which, beyond all others, a Prince should guard.<br /><br />Wherefore it is wiser to put up with the name of being miserly, which breeds ignominy, but without hate, than to be obliged, from the desire to be reckoned liberal, to incur the reproach of rapacity, which breeds hate as well as ignominy.<br /><br />'", "id": 115, "section_id": 137},{"content": " '<b>Chapter XVII: Of Cruelty and Clemency, and Whether It Is Better To Be Loved or Feared</b><br /><br />Passing to the other qualities above referred to, I say that every Prince should desire to be accounted merciful and not cruel. Nevertheless, he should be on his guard against the abuse of this quality of mercy. Cesare Borgia was reputed cruel, yet his cruelty restored Romagna, united it, and brought it to order and obedience; so that if we look at things in their true light, it will be seen that he was in reality far more merciful than the people of Florence, who, to avoid the imputation of cruelty, suffered Pistoja to be torn to pieces by factions.<br /><br />A Prince should therefore disregard the reproach of being thought cruel where it enables him to keep his subjects united and obedient. For he who quells disorder by a very few signal examples will in the end be more merciful than he who from too great leniency permits things to take their course and so to result in rapine and bloodshed; for these hurt the whole State, whereas the severities of the Prince injure individuals only.<br /><br />And for a new Prince, of all others, it is impossible to escape a name for cruelty, since new States are full of dangers. Wherefore Virgil, by the mouth of Dido, excuses the harshness of her reign on the plea that it was new, saying:&mdash;<br /><br />`A fate unkind, and newness in my reign<br />Compel me thus to guard a wide domain.&rsquo;<br /><br />Nevertheless, the new Prince should not be too ready of belief, nor too easily set in motion; nor should he himself be the first to raise alarms; but should so temper prudence with kindliness that too great confidence in others shall not throw him off his guard, nor groundless distrust render him insupportable.<br /><br />And here comes in the question whether it is better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved. It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both; but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved. For of men it may generally be affirmed, that they are thankless, fickle, false studious to avoid danger, greedy of gain, devoted to you while you are able to confer benefits upon them, and ready, as I said before, while danger is distant, to shed their blood, and sacrifice their property, their lives, and their children for you; but in the hour of need they turn against you. The Prince, therefore, who without otherwise securing himself builds wholly on their professions is undone. For the friendships which we buy with a price, and do not gain by greatness and nobility of character, though they be fairly earned are not made good, but fail us when we have occasion to use them.<br /><br />Moreover, men are less careful how they offend him who makes himself loved than him who makes himself feared. For love is held by the tie of obligation, which, because men are a sorry breed, is broken on every whisper of private interest; but fear is bound by the apprehension of punishment which never relaxes its grasp.<br /><br />Nevertheless a Prince should inspire fear in such a fashion that if he do not win love he may escape hate. For a man may very well be feared and yet not hated, and this will be the case so long as he does not meddle with the property or with the women of his citizens and subjects. And if constrained to put any to death, he should do so only when there is manifest cause or reasonable justification. But, above all, he must abstain from the property of others. For men will sooner forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony. Moreover, pretexts for confiscation are never to seek, and he who has once begun to live by rapine always finds reasons for taking what is not his; whereas reasons for shedding blood are fewer, and sooner exhausted.<br /><br />But when a Prince is with his army, and has many soldiers under his command, he must needs disregard the reproach of cruelty, for without such a reputation in its Captain, no army can be held together or kept under any kind of control. Among other things remarkable in Hannibal this has been noted, that having a very great army, made up of men of many different nations and brought to fight in a foreign country, no dissension ever arose among the soldiers themselves, nor any mutiny against their leader, either in his good or in his evil fortunes. This we can only ascribe to the transcendent cruelty, which, joined with numberless great qualities, rendered him at once venerable and terrible in the eyes of his soldiers; for without this reputation for cruelty these other virtues would not have produced the like results.<br /><br />Unreflecting writers, indeed, while they praise his achievements, have condemned the chief cause of them; but that his other merits would not by themselves have been so efficacious we may see from the case of Scipio, one of the greatest Captains, not of his own time only but of all times of which we have record, whose armies rose against him in Spain from no other cause than his too great leniency in allowing them a freedom inconsistent with military strictness. With which weakness Fabius Maximus taxed him in the Senate House, calling him the corrupter of the Roman soldiery. Again, when the Locrians were shamefully outraged by one of his lieutenants, he neither avenged them, nor punished the insolence of his officer; and this from the natural easiness of his disposition. So that it was said in the Senate by one who sought to excuse him, that there were many who knew better how to refrain from doing wrong themselves than how to correct the wrong-doing of others. This temper, however, must in time have marred the name and fame even of Scipio, had he continued in it, and retained his command. But living as he did under the control of the Senate, this hurtful quality was not merely disguised, but came to be regarded as a glory.<br /><br />Returning to the question of being loved or feared, I sum up by saying, that since his being loved depends upon his subjects, while his being feared depends upon himself, a wise Prince should build on what is his own, and not on what rests with others. Only, as I have said, he must do his utmost to escape hatred.<br /><br />'", "id": 116, "section_id": 138},{"content": " '<br /><br />Midway upon the journey of our life<br />&nbsp; I found myself within a forest dark,<br />&nbsp;

Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\\r\\nslumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near\\r\\nher, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\\r\\nstanding with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.</p>\\r\\n<p>Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"This is a pleasure,\" said he, in rather a low voice, \"coming at\\r\\nleast ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to\\r\\nbe useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What!\" said Mrs. Weston, \"have not you finished it yet? you would\\r\\nnot earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have not been working uninterruptedly,\" he replied, \"I have been\\r\\nassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\\r\\nit was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\\r\\nwe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to\\r\\nbe persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\\r\\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to\\r\\nmake her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite\\r\\nready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately\\r\\nready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had\\r\\nnot yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without\\r\\nemotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and\\r\\nEmma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could\\r\\nnot but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.</p>\\r\\n<p>At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\\r\\npowers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.\\r\\nWeston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined\\r\\nher in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper\\r\\ndiscrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,\" said Frank Churchill, with\\r\\na smile at Emma, \"the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\\r\\nColonel Campbell''s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper\\r\\nnotes I am sure is exactly what he and <i>all</i> <i>that</i> <i>party</i>\\r\\nwould particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave\\r\\nhis friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do\\r\\nnot you think so?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is not fair,\" said Emma, in a whisper; \"mine was a random guess. Do not distress her.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on\\r\\nthis occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and\\r\\nwonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument''s\\r\\ncoming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to\\r\\nbe going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the\\r\\nconsequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have\\r\\nsent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to\\r\\ndepend upon contingencies and conveniences?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,\" said she, in a voice\\r\\nof forced calmness, \"I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must\\r\\nbe all conjecture.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\\r\\nconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this\\r\\nrivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at\\r\\nwork, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold their\\r\\ntongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word--Miss\\r\\nFairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have\\r\\nthe pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles,\\r\\nhealed for the present.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a\\r\\nlittle from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss\\r\\nFairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"If you are very kind,\" said he, \"it will be one of the waltzes we\\r\\ndanced last night;--let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them\\r\\nas I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we\\r\\ndanced no longer; but I would have given worlds-- all the worlds one\\r\\never has to give--for another half-hour.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She played.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which <i>has</i> made one happy!-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played\\r\\nsomething else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,\\r\\nand turning to Emma, said,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.-- And\\r\\nhere are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one\\r\\nmight expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of\\r\\nColonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music\\r\\nhere. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to\\r\\nhave been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\\r\\nincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being\\r\\namused; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught\\r\\nthe remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of\\r\\nconsciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less\\r\\nscruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to\\r\\nher.--This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently\\r\\ncherishing very reprehensible feelings.</p>\\r\\n<p>He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.-- Emma took the opportunity of whispering,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You speak too plain. She must understand you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have\\r\\nnow a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she\\r\\ndoes wrong, she ought to feel it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She is not entirely without it, I think.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I do not see much sign of it. She is playing <i>Robin</i> <i>Adair</i> at this moment--<i>his</i> favourite.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible, just to\\r\\nthank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;\\r\\nbut I can go into my mother''s room you know. I dare say he will come in\\r\\nwhen he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet\\r\\nso!--Our little room so honoured!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening\\r\\nthe casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley''s attention, and\\r\\nevery syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the\\r\\nothers, as if it had passed within the same apartment.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How d'' ye do?--how d''ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged to\\r\\nyou for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just\\r\\nready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends\\r\\nhere.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard\\r\\nin his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all,\\r\\nbut particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no\\r\\ncold last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would\\r\\nhear her in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston\\r\\ngave Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head\\r\\nin steady scepticism.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,\" resumed Miss Bates.</p>\\r\\n<p>He cut her short with,</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for <i>you</i>?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?-- Miss\\r\\nWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new\\r\\npianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well,\" said he, in a deliberating manner, \"for five minutes, perhaps.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful; so many friends!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the pianoforte.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party\\r\\nlast night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--\\r\\nWas not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never\\r\\nsaw any thing equal to it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose\\r\\nMiss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that\\r\\npasses. And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss\\r\\nFairfax should not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very\\r\\nwell; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player, without\\r\\nexception, in England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they\\r\\nwill say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot\\r\\nstay to hear it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence-- so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What is the matter now?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had\\r\\na great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!\\r\\nMrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You\\r\\nshould not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never\\r\\ncan bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it\\r\\nwould have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . Well, (returning to\\r\\nthe room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop.\\r\\nHe is going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing. . . .\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Jane, \"we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door\\r\\nwas open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You\\r\\nmust have heard every thing to be sure. `Can I do any thing for you at\\r\\nKingston?'' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must\\r\\nyou be going?--You seem but just come--so very obliging of you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already\\r\\nlasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was\\r\\nperceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave\\r\\nalso, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to\\r\\nHartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.</p>'", "id": 176, "section_id": 203},{"content": " '<br /><br />At the return of consciousness, that closed<br />&nbsp;

Nevertheless, we see from what has taken place in our own days that Princes who have set little store by their word, but have known how to overreach men by their cunning, have accomplished great things, and in the end got the better of those who trusted to honest dealing.<br /><br />Be it known, then, that there are two ways of contending, one in accordance with the laws, the other by force; the first of which is proper to men, the second to beasts. But since the first method is often ineffectual, it becomes necessary to resort to the second. A Prince should, therefore, understand how to use well both the man and the beast. And this lesson has been covertly taught by the ancient writers, who relate how Achilles and many others of these old Princes were given over to be brought up and trained by Chiron the Centaur; since the only meaning of their having for instructor one who was half man and half beast is, that it is necessary for a Prince to know how to use both natures, and that the one without the other has no stability.<br /><br />But since a Prince should know how to use the beast&rsquo;s nature wisely, he ought of beasts to choose both the lion and the fox; for the lion cannot guard himself from the toils, nor the fox from wolves. He must therefore be a fox to discern toils, and a lion to drive off wolves.<br /><br />To rely wholly on the lion is unwise; and for this reason a prudent Prince neither can nor ought to keep his word when to keep it is hurtful to him and the causes which led him to pledge it are removed. If all men were good, this would not be good advice, but since they are dishonest and do not keep faith with you, you in return, need not keep faith with them; and no prince was ever at a loss for plausible reasons to cloak a breach of faith. Of this numberless recent instances could be given, and it might be shown how many solemn treaties and engagements have been rendered inoperative and idle through want of faith in Princes, and that he who was best known to play the fox has had the best success.<br /><br />It is necessary, indeed, to put a good colour on this nature, and to be skilful in simulating and dissembling. But men are so simple, and governed so absolutely by their present needs, that he who wishes to deceive will never fail in finding willing dupes. One recent example I will not omit. Pope Alexander VI had no care or thought but how to deceive, and always found material to work on. No man ever had a more effective manner of asseverating, or made promises with more solemn protestations, or observed them less. And yet, because he understood this side of human nature, his frauds always succeeded.<br /><br />It is not essential, then, that a Prince should have all the good qualities which I have enumerated above, but it is most essential that he should seem to have them; I will even venture to affirm that if he has and invariably practises them all, they are hurtful, whereas the appearance of having them is useful. Thus, it is well to seem merciful, faithful, humane, religious, and upright, and also to be so; but the mind should remain so balanced that were it needful not to be so, you should be able and know how to change to the contrary.<br /><br />And you are to understand that a Prince, and most of all a new Prince, cannot observe all those rules of conduct in respect whereof men are accounted good, being often forced, in order to preserve his Princedom, to act in opposition to good faith, charity, humanity, and religion. He must therefore keep his mind ready to shift as the winds and tides of Fortune turn, and, as I have already said, he ought not to quit good courses if he can help it, but should know how to follow evil courses if he must.<br /><br />A Prince should therefore be very careful that nothing ever escapes his lips which is not replete with the five qualities above named, so that to see and hear him, one would think him the embodiment of mercy, good faith, integrity, humanity, and religion. And there is no virtue which it is more necessary for him to seem to possess than this last; because men in general judge rather by the eye than by the hand, for every one can see but few can touch. Every one sees what you seem, but few know what you are, and these few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many who have the majesty of the State to back them up.<br /><br />Moreover, in the actions of all men, and most of all of Princes, where there is no tribunal to which we can appeal, we look to results. Wherefore if a Prince succeeds in establishing and maintaining his authority, the means will always be judged honourable and be approved by every one. For the vulgar are always taken by appearances and by results, and the world is made up of the vulgar, the few only finding room when the many have no longer ground to stand on.<br /><br />A certain Prince of our own days, whose name it is as well not to mention, is always preaching peace and good faith, although the mortal enemy of both; and both, had he practised them as he preaches them, would, oftener than once, have lost him his kingdom and authority.<br /><br />'", "id": 126, "section_id": 149},{"content": " '<br /><br />That hue which cowardice brought out on me,<br />&nbsp;

and that whenever he succeeds in keeping clear of these, he has performed his part, and runs no risk though he incur other infamies.<br /><br />A Prince, as I have said before, sooner becomes hated by being rapacious and by interfering with the property and with the women of his subjects, than in any other way. From these, therefore, he should abstain. For so long as neither their property nor their honour is touched, the mass of mankind live contentedly, and the Prince has only to cope with the ambition of a few, which can in many ways and easily be kept within bounds.<br /><br />A Prince is despised when he is seen to be fickle, frivolous, effeminate, pusillanimous, or irresolute, against which defects he ought therefore most carefully to guard, striving so to bear himself that greatness, courage, wisdom, and strength may appear in all his actions. In his private dealings with his subjects his decisions should be irrevocable, and his reputation such that no one would dream of overreaching or cajoling him.<br /><br />The Prince who inspires such an opinion of himself is greatly esteemed, and against one who is greatly esteemed conspiracy is difficult; nor, when he is known to be an excellent Prince and held in reverence by his subjects, will it be easy to attack him. For a Prince is exposed to two dangers, from within in respect of his subjects, from without in respect of foreign powers. Against the latter he will defend himself with good arms and good allies, and if he have good arms he will always have good allies; and when things are settled abroad, they will always be settled at home, unless disturbed by conspiracies; and even should there be hostility from without, if he has taken those measures, and has lived in the way I have recommended, and if he never abandons hope, he will withstand every attack; as I have said was done by Nabis the Spartan.<br /><br />As regards his own subjects, when affairs are quiet abroad, he has to fear they may engage in secret plots; against which a Prince best secures himself when he escapes being hated or despised, and keeps on good terms with his people; and this, as I have already shown at length, it is essential he should do. Not to be hated or despised by the body of his subjects, is one of the surest safeguards that a Prince can have against conspiracy. For he who conspires always reckons on pleasing the people by putting the Prince to death; but when he sees that instead of pleasing he will offend them, he cannot summon courage to carry out his design. For the difficulties that attend conspirators are infinite, and we know from experience that while there have been many conspiracies, few of them have succeeded.<br /><br />He who conspires cannot do so alone, nor can he assume as his companions any save those whom he believes to be discontented; but so soon as you impart your design to a discontented man, you supply him with the means of removing his discontent, since by betraying you he can procure for himself every advantage; so that seeing on the one hand certain gain, and on the other a doubtful and dangerous risk, he must either be a rare friend to you, or the mortal enemy of his Prince, if he keep your secret.<br /><br />To put the matter shortly, I say that on the side of the conspirator there are distrust, jealousy, and dread of punishment to deter him, while on the side of the Prince there are the laws, the majesty of the throne, the protection of friends and of the government to defend him; to which if the general good-will of the people be added, it is hardly possible that any should be rash enough to conspire. For while in ordinary cases, the conspirator has ground for fear only before the execution of his villainy, in this case he has also cause to fear after the crime has been perpetrated, since he has the people for his enemy, and is thus cut off from every hope of shelter.<br /><br />Of this, endless instances might be given, but I shall content myself with one that happened within the recollection of our fathers. Messer Annibale Bentivoglio, Lord of Bologna and grandfather of the present Messer Annibale, was conspired against and murdered by the Canneschi, leaving behind none belonging to him save Messer Giovanni, then an infant in arms. Immediately upon the murder, the people rose and put all the Canneschi to death. This resulted from the general goodwill with which the House of the Bentivogli was then regarded in Bologna; which feeling was so strong, that when upon the death of Messer Annibale no one was left who could govern the State, there being reason to believe that a descendant of the family (who up to that time had been thought to be the son of a smith), was living in Florence, the citizens of Bologna came there for him, and entrusted him with the government of their city; which he retained until Messer Giovanni was old enough to govern.<br /><br />To be brief, a Prince has little to fear from conspiracies when his subjects are well disposed towards him; but when they are hostile and hold him in detestation, he has then reason to fear everything and every one. And well ordered States and wise Princes have provided with extreme care that the nobility shall not be driven to desperation, and that the commons shall be kept satisfied and contented; for this is one of the most important matters that a Prince has to look to.<br /><br />Among the well ordered and governed Kingdoms of our day is that of France, wherein we find an infinite number of wise institutions, upon which depend the freedom and the security of the King, and of which the most important are the Parliament and its authority. For he who gave its constitution to this Realm, knowing the ambition and arrogance of the nobles, and judging it necessary to bridle and restrain them, and on the other hand knowing the hatred, originating in fear, entertained against them by the commons, and desiring that they should be safe, was unwilling that the responsibility for this should rest on the King; and to relieve him of the ill-will which he might incur with the nobles by favouring the commons, or with the commons by favouring the nobles, appointed a third party to be arbitrator, who without committing the King, might depress the nobles and uphold the commons. Nor could there be any better, wiser, or surer safeguard for the King and the Kingdom. And hence we may draw another notable lesson, namely, that Princes should devolve on others those matters that entail responsibility, and reserve to themselves those that relate to grace and favour. And again I say that a Prince should esteem the great, but must not make himself odious to the people.<br /><br />To some it may perhaps appear, that if the lives and deaths of many of the Roman Emperors be considered, they offer examples opposed to the views expressed by me; since we find that some among them who had always lived good lives, and shown themselves possessed of great qualities, were nevertheless deposed and even put to death by their subjects who had conspired against them.<br /><br />In answer to such objections, I shall examine the characters of several Emperors, and show that the causes of their downfall were in no way different from those which I have indicated. In doing this I shall submit for consideration such matters only as must strike every one who reads the history of these times; and it will be enough for my purpose to take those Emperors who reigned from the time of Marcus the Philosopher to the time of Maximinus, who were, inclusively, Marcus, Commodus his son, Pertinax, Julianus, Severus, Caracalla his son, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.<br /><br />In the first place, then, we have to note that while in other Princedoms the Prince has only to contend with the ambition of the nobles and the insubordination of the people, the Roman Emperors had a further difficulty to encounter in the cruelty and rapacity of their soldiers, which were so distracting as to cause the ruin of many of these Princes. For it was hardly possible for them to satisfy both the soldiers and the people; the latter loving peace and therefore preferring sober Princes, while the former preferred a Prince of a warlike spirit, however harsh, haughty, or rapacious; being willing that he should exercise these qualities against the people, as the means of procuring for themselves double pay, and indulging their greed and cruelty.<br /><br />Whence it followed that those Emperors who had not inherited or won for themselves such authority as enabled them to keep both people and soldiers in check, were always ruined. The most of them, and those especially who came to the Empire new and without experience, seeing the difficulty of dealing with these conflicting humours, set themselves to satisfy the soldiers, and made little account of offending the people. And for them this was a necessary course to take; for as Princes cannot escape being hated by some, they should, in the first place, endeavour not to be hated by a class; failing in which, they must do all they can to escape the hatred of that class which is the stronger. Wherefore those Emperors who, by reason of their newness, stood in need of extraordinary support, sided with the soldiery rather than with the people; a course which turned out advantageous or otherwise, according as the Prince knew, or did not know, how to maintain his authority over them.<br /><br />From the causes indicated it resulted that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being Princes of a temperate disposition, lovers of justice, enemies of cruelty, gentle, and kindly, had all, save Marcus, an unhappy end. Marcus alone lived and died honoured in the highest degree; and this because he had succeeded to the Empire by right of inheritance, and not through the favour either of the soldiery or of the people; and also because, being endowed with many virtues which made him revered, he kept, while he lived, both factions within bounds, and was never either hated or despised.<br /><br />But Pertinax was chosen Emperor against the will of the soldiery, who being accustomed to a licentious life under Commodus, could not tolerate the stricter discipline to which his successor sought to bring them back. And having thus made himself hated, and being at the same time despised by reason of his advanced age, he was ruined at the very outset of his reign.<br /><br />And here it is to be noted that hatred is incurred as well on account of good actions as of bad; or which reason, as I have already said, a Prince who would maintain his authority is often compelled to be other than good. For when the class, be it the people, the soldiers, or the nobles, on whom you judge it necessary to rely for your support, is corrupt, you must needs adapt yourself to its humours, and satisfy these, in which case virtuous conduct will only prejudice you.<br /><br />Let us now come to Alexander, who was so just a ruler that among the praises ascribed to him it is recorded, that, during the fourteen years he held the Empire, no man was ever put to death by him without trial. Nevertheless, being accounted effeminate, and thought to be governed by his mother, he fell into contempt, and the army conspiring against him, slew him.<br /><br />When we turn to consider the characters of Commodus, Severus, and Caracalla, we find them all to have been most cruel and rapacious Princes, who to satisfy the soldiery, scrupled not to inflict every kind of wrong upon the people. And all of them, except Severus, came to a bad end. But in Severus there was such strength of character, that, keeping the soldiers his friends, he was able, although he oppressed the people, to reign on prosperously to the last; because his great qualities made him so admirable in the eyes both of the people and the soldiers, that the former remained in a manner amazed and awestruck, while the latter were respectful and contented.<br /><br />And because his actions, for one who was a new Prince, were thus remarkable, I will point out shortly how well he understood to play the part both of the lion and of the fox, each of which natures, as I have observed before, a Prince should know how to assume.<br /><br />Knowing the indolent disposition of the Emperor Julianus, Severus persuaded the army which he commanded in Illyria that it was their duty to go to Rome to avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been slain by the Pretorian guards. Under this pretext, and without disclosing his design on the Empire, he put his army in march, and reached Italy before it was known that he had set out. On his arrival in Rome, the Senate, through fear, elected him Emperor and put Julianus to death. After taking this first step, two obstacles still remained to his becoming sole master of the Empire; one in Asia, where Niger who commanded the armies of the East had caused himself to be proclaimed Emperor; the other in the West, where Albinus, who also aspired to the Empire, was in command. And as Severus judged it dangerous to declare open war against both, he resolved to proceed against Niger by arms, and against Albinus by artifice. To the latter, accordingly, he wrote, that having been chosen Emperor by the Senate, he desired to share the dignity with him; that he therefore sent him the title of Caesar, and in accordance with a resolution of the Senate assumed him as his colleague. All which statements Albinus accepted as true. But so soon as Severus had defeated and slain Niger, and restored tranquillity in the East, returning to Rome he complained in the Senate that Albinus, all unmindful of the favours he had received from him, had treacherously sought to destroy him; for which cause he was compelled to go and punish his ingratitude. Whereupon he set forth to seek Albinus in Gaul, where he at once deprived him of his dignities and his life.<br /><br />Whoever, therefore, examines carefully the actions of this Emperor, will find in him all the fierceness of the lion and all the craft of the fox, and will note how he was feared and respected by the people, yet not hated by the army, and will not be surprised that though a new man, he was able to maintain his hold of so great an Empire. For the splendour of his reputation always shielded him from the odium which the people might otherwise have conceived against him by reason of his cruelty and rapacity.<br /><br />Caracalla, his son, was likewise a man of great parts, endowed with qualities that made him admirable in the sight of the people, and endeared him to the army, being of a warlike spirit, most patient of fatigue, and contemning all luxury in food and every other effeminacy. Nevertheless, his ferocity and cruelty were so extravagant and unheard of (he having put to death a vast number of the inhabitants of Rome at different times, and the whole of those of Alexandria at a stroke), that he came to be detested by all the world, and so feared even by those whom he had about him, that at the last he was slain by a centurion in the midst of his army.<br /><br />And here let it be noted that deaths like this which are the result of a deliberate and fixed resolve, cannot be escaped by Princes, since any one who disregards his own life can effect them. A Prince, however, needs the less to fear them as they are seldom attempted. The only precaution he can take is to avoid doing grave wrong to any of those who serve him, or whom he has near him as officers of his Court, a precaution which Caracalla neglected in putting to a shameful death the brother of this centurion, and in using daily threats against the man himself, whom he nevertheless retained as one of his bodyguard. This, as the event showed, was a rash and fatal course.<br /><br />We come next to Commodus, who, as he took the Empire by hereditary right, ought to have held it with much ease. For being the son of Marcus, he had only to follow in his father&rsquo;s footsteps to content both the people and the soldiery. But being of a cruel and brutal nature, to sate his rapacity at the expense of the people, he sought support from the army, and indulged it in every kind of excess. On the other hand, by an utter disregard of his dignity, in frequently descending into the arena to fight with gladiators, and by other base acts wholly unworthy of the Imperial station, he became contemptible in the eyes of the soldiery; and being on the one hand hated, on the other despised, was at last conspired against and murdered.<br /><br />The character of Maximinus remains to be touched upon. He was of a very warlike disposition, and on the death of Alexander, of whom we have already spoken, was chosen Emperor by the army who had been displeased with the effeminacy of that Prince. But this dignity he did not long enjoy, since two causes concurred to render him at once odious and contemptible; the one the baseness of his origin, he having at one time herded sheep in Thrace, a fact well known to all, and which led all to look on him with disdain; the other that on being proclaimed Emperor, delaying to repair to Rome and enter on possession of the Imperial throne, he incurred the reputation of excessive cruelty by reason of the many atrocities perpetrated by his prefects in Rome and other parts of the Empire. The result was that the whole world, stirred at once with scorn of his mean birth and with the hatred which the dread of his ferocity inspired, combined against him, Africa leading the way, the Senate and people of Rome and the whole of Italy following. In which conspiracy his own army joined. For they, being engaged in the siege of Aquileja and finding difficulty in reducing it, disgusted with his cruelty, and less afraid of him when they saw so many against him, put him to death.<br /><br />I need say nothing of Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julianus, all of whom being utterly despicable, came to a speedy downfall, but shall conclude these remarks by observing, that the Princes of our own days are less troubled with the difficulty of having to make constant efforts to keep their soldier in good humour. For though they must treat them with some indulgence, the need for doing so is soon over, since none of these Princes possesses a standing army which, like the armies of the Roman Empire, has strengthened with the growth of his government and the administration of his State. And if it was then necessary to satisfy the soldiers rather than the people, because the soldiers were more powerful than the people, now it is more necessary for all Princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the people rather than the soldiery, since the former are more powerful than the latter.<br /><br />I except the Turk because he has always about him some twelve thousand foot soldiers and fifteen thousand horse, on whom depend the security and strength of his kingdom, and with whom he must needs keep on good terms, all regard for the people being subordinate. The government of the Soldan is similar, so that he too being wholly in the hands of his soldiers, must keep well with them without regard to the people.<br /><br />And here you are to note that the State of the Soldan, while it is unlike all other Princedoms, resembles the Christian Pontificate in this, that it can neither be classed as new, nor as hereditary. For the sons of a Soldan who dies do not succeed to the kingdom as his heirs, but he who is elected to the post by those who have authority to make such elections. And this being the ancient and established order of things, the Princedoms cannot be accounted new, since none of the difficulties that attend new Princedoms are found in it. For although the Prince be new, the institutions of the State are old, and are so contrived that the elected Prince is accepted as though he were an hereditary Sovereign.<br /><br />But returning to the matter in hand, I say that whoever reflects on the above reasoning will see that either hatred or contempt was the ruin of the Emperors whom I have named; and will also understand how it happened that some taking one way and some the opposite, one only by each of these roads came to a happy, and all the rest to an unhappy end. Because for Pertinax and Alexander, they being new Princes, it was useless and hurtful to try to imitate Marcus, who was an hereditary Prince; and similarly for Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus it was a fatal error to imitate Severus, since they lacked the qualities that would have enabled them to tread in his footsteps.<br /><br />In short, a Prince new to the Princedom cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor is it necessary that he should imitate all those of Severus; but he should borrow from Severus those parts of his conduct which are needed to serve as a foundation for his government, and from Marcus those suited to maintain it, and render it glorious when once established.<br /><br />'", "id": 129, "section_id": 152},{"content": " '<br /><br />Upon the margin of a lofty bank<br />&nbsp;

some have fostered hostility against themselves, others have sought to gain over those who at the beginning of their reign were looked on with suspicion; some have built fortresses, others have dismantled and destroyed them; and though no definite judgment can be pronounced respecting any of these methods, without regard to the special circumstances of the State to which it is proposed to apply them, I shall nevertheless speak of them in as comprehensive a way as the nature of the subject will admit.<br /><br />It has never chanced that any new Prince has disarmed his subjects. On the contrary, when he has found them unarmed he has always armed them. For the arms thus provided become yours, those whom you suspected grow faithful, while those who were faithful at the first, continue so, and from your subjects become your partisans. And though all your subjects cannot be armed, yet if those of them whom you arm be treated with marked favour, you can deal more securely with the rest. For the difference which those whom you supply with arms perceive in their treatment, will bind them to you, while the others will excuse you, recognizing that those who incur greater risk and responsibility merit greater rewards. But by disarming, you at once give offence, since you show your subjects that you distrust them, either as doubting their courage, or as doubting their fidelity, each of which imputations begets hatred against you. Moreover, as you cannot maintain yourself without arms you must have recourse to mercenary troops. What these are I have already shown, but even if they were good, they could never avail to defend you, at once against powerful enemies abroad and against subjects whom you distrust. Wherefore, as I have said already, new Princes in new Princedoms have always provided for their being armed; and of instances of this History is full.<br /><br />But when a Prince acquires a new State, which thus becomes joined on like a limb to his old possessions, he must disarm its inhabitants, except such of them as have taken part with him while he was acquiring it; and even these, as time and occasion serve, he should seek to render soft and effeminate; and he must so manage matters that all the arms of the new State shall be in the hands of his own soldiers who have served under him in his ancient dominions.<br /><br />Our forefathers, even such among them as were esteemed wise, were wont to say that &rsquo;Pistoja was to be held by feuds, and Pisa by fortresses,&rsquo; and on this principle used to promote dissensions in various subject towns with a view to retain them with less effort. At a time when Italy was in some measure in equilibrium, this may have been a prudent course to follow; but at the present day it seems impossible to recommend it as a general rule of policy. For I do not believe that divisions purposely caused can ever lead to good; on the contrary, when an enemy approaches, divided cities are lost at once, for the weaker faction will always side with the invader, and the other will not be able to stand alone.<br /><br />The Venetians, influenced as I believe by the reasons above mentioned, fostered the factions of Guelf and Ghibelline in the cities subject to them; and though they did not suffer blood to be shed, fomented their feuds, in order that the citizens having their minds occupied with these disputes might not conspire against them. But this, as we know, did not turn out to their advantage, for after their defeat at Vaila, one of the two factions, suddenly taking courage, deprived them of the whole of their territory.<br /><br />Moreover methods like these argue weakness in a Prince, for under a strong government such divisions would never be permitted, since they are profitable only in time of peace as an expedient whereby subjects may be more easily managed; but when war breaks out their insufficiency is demonstrated.<br /><br />Doubtless, Princes become great by vanquishing difficulties and opposition, and Fortune, on that account, when she desires to aggrandize a new Prince, who has more need than an hereditary Prince to win reputation, causes enemies to spring up, and urges them on to attack him, to the end that he may have opportunities to overcome them, and make his ascent by the very ladder which they have planted. For which reason, many are of the opinion that a wise Prince, when he has the occasion, ought dexterously to promote hostility to himself in certain quarters, in order that his greatness may be enhanced by crushing it.<br /><br />Princes, and new Princes especially, have found greater fidelity and helpfulness in those whom, at the beginning of their reign, they have held in suspicion, than in those who at the outset have enjoyed their confidence; and Pandolfo Petrucci, Lord of Siena, governed his State by the instrumentality of those whom he had at one time distrusted, in preference to all others. But on this point it is impossible to lay down any general rule, since the course to be followed varies with the circumstances. This only I will say, that those men who at the beginning of a reign have been hostile, if of a sort requiring support to maintain them, may always be won over by the Prince with much ease, and are the more bound to serve him faithfully because they know that they have to efface by their conduct the unfavourable impression he had formed of them; and in this way a Prince always obtains better help from them, than from those who serving him in too complete security neglect his affairs.<br /><br />And since the subject suggests it, I must not fail to remind the Prince who acquires a new State through the favour of its inhabitants, to weigh well what were the causes which led those who favoured him to do so; and if it be seen that they have acted not from any natural affection for him, but merely out of discontent with the former government, that he will find the greatest difficulty in keeping them his friends, since it will be impossible for him to content them. Carefully considering the cause of this, with the aid of examples taken from times ancient and modern, he will perceive that it is far easier to secure the friendship of those who being satisfied with things as they stood, were for that very reason his enemies, than of those who sided with him and aided him in his usurpation only because they were discontented.<br /><br />It has been customary for Princes, with a view to hold their dominions more securely, to build fortresses which might serve as a curb and restraint on such as have designs against them, and as a safe refuge against a first onset. I approve this custom, because it has been followed from the earliest times. Nevertheless, in our own days, Messer Niccolo Vitelli thought it prudent to dismantle two fortresses in Citt&agrave; di Castello in order to secure that town: and Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to his dominions, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to their foundations the fortresses throughout the Dukedom, judging that if these were removed, it would not again be so easily lost. A like course was followed by the Bentivogli on their return to Bologna.<br /><br />Fortresses, therefore, are useful or no, according to circumstances, and if in one way they benefit, in another they injure you. We may state the case thus: the Prince who is more afraid of his subjects than of strangers ought to build fortresses, while he who is more afraid of strangers than of his subjects, should leave them alone. The citadel built by Francesco Sforza in Milan, has been, and will hereafter prove to be, more dangerous to the House of Sforza than any other disorder of that State. So that, on the whole, the best fortress you can have, is in not being hated by your subjects. If they hate you no fortress will save you; for when once the people take up arms, foreigners are never wanting to assist them.<br /><br />Within our own time it does not appear that fortresses have been of service to any Prince, unless to the Countess of Forli after her husband Count Girolamo was murdered; for by this means she was able to escape the first onset of the insurgents, and awaiting succour from Milan, to recover her State; the circumstances of the times not allowing any foreigner to lend assistance to the people. But afterwards, when she was attacked by Cesare Borgia, and the people, out of hostility to her, took part with the invader, her fortresses were of little avail. So that, both on this and on the former occasion, it would have been safer for her to have had no fortresses, than to have had her subjects for enemies.<br /><br />All which considerations taken into account, I shall applaud him who builds fortresses, and him who does not; but I shall blame him who, trusting in them, reckons it a light thing to be held in hatred by his people.<br /><br />'", "id": 131, "section_id": 156},{"content": " '<br /><br />The place where to descend the bank we came<br />&nbsp;

And if you consider his achievements you will find them all great and some extraordinary.<br /><br />In the beginning of his reign he made war on Granada, which enterprise was the foundation of his power. At first he carried on the war leisurely, without fear of interruption, and kept the attention and thoughts of the Barons of Castile so completely occupied with it, that they had no time to think of changes at home. Meanwhile he insensibly acquired reputation among them and authority over them. With the money of the Church and of his subjects he was able to maintain his armies, and during the prolonged contest to lay the foundations of that military discipline which afterwards made him so famous. Moreover, to enable him to engage in still greater undertakings, always covering himself with the cloak of religion, he had recourse to what may be called pious cruelty, in driving out and clearing his Kingdom of the Moors; than which exploit none could be more wonderful or uncommon. Using the same pretext he made war on Africa, invaded Italy, and finally attacked France; and being thus constantly busied in planning and executing vast designs, he kept the minds of his subjects in suspense and admiration, and occupied with the results of his actions, which arose one out of another in such close succession as left neither time nor opportunity to oppose them.<br /><br />Again, it greatly profits a Prince in conducting the internal government of his State, to follow striking methods, such as are recorded of Messer Bernabo of Milan, whenever the remarkable actions of any one in civil life, whether for good or for evil, afford him occasion; and to choose such ways of rewarding and punishing as cannot fail to be much spoken of. But above all, he should strive by all his actions to inspire a sense of his greatness and goodness.<br /><br />A Prince is likewise esteemed who is a stanch friend and a thorough foe, that is to say, who without reserve openly declares for one against another, this being always a more advantageous course than to stand neutral. For supposing two of your powerful neighbours come to blows, it must either be that you have, or have not, reason to fear the one who comes off victorious. In either case it will always be well for you to declare yourself, and join in frankly with one side or other. For should you fail to do so you are certain, in the former of the cases put, to become the prey of the victor to the satisfaction and delight of the vanquished, and no reason or circumstance that you may plead will avail to shield or shelter you; for the victor dislikes doubtful friends, and such as will not help him at a pinch; and the vanquished will have nothing to say to you, since you would not share his fortunes sword in hand.<br /><br />When Antiochus, at the instance of the Aetolians, passed into Greece in order to drive out the Romans, he sent envoys to the Achaians, who were friendly to the Romans, exhorting them to stand neutral. The Romans, on the other hand, urged them to take up arms on their behalf. The matter coming to be discussed in the Council of the Achaians, the legate of Antiochus again urged neutrality, whereupon the Roman envoy answered&mdash;&rsquo;Nothing can be less to your advantage than the course which has been recommended as the best and most useful for your State, namely, to refrain from taking any part in our war, for by standing aloof you will gain neither favour nor fame, but remain the prize of the victor.&rsquo; And it will always happen that he who is not your friend will invite you to neutrality, while he who is your friend will call on you to declare yourself openly in arms. Irresolute Princes, to escape immediate danger, commonly follow the neutral path, in most instances to their destruction. But when you pronounce valiantly in favour of one side or other, if he to whom you give your adherence conquers, although he be powerful and you are at his mercy, still he is under obligations to you, and has become your friend; and none are so lost to shame as to destroy with manifest ingratitude, one who has helped them. Besides which, victories are never so complete that the victor can afford to disregard all considerations whatsoever, more especially considerations of justice. On the other hand, if he with whom you take part should lose, you will always be favourably regarded by him; while he can he will aid you, and you become his companion in a cause which may recover.<br /><br />In the second case, namely, when both combatants are of such limited strength that whichever wins you have no cause to fear, it is all the more prudent for you to take a side, for you will then be ruining the one with the help of the other, who were he wise would endeavour to save him. If he whom you help conquers, he remains in your power, and with your aid he cannot but conquer.<br /><br />And here let it be noted that a Prince should be careful never to join with one stronger than himself in attacking others, unless, as already said, he be driven to it by necessity. For if he whom you join prevails, you are at his mercy; and Princes, so far as in them lies, should avoid placing themselves at the mercy of others. The Venetians, although they might have declined the alliance, joined with France against the Duke of Milan, which brought about their ruin. But when an alliance cannot be avoided, as was the case with the Florentines when the Pope and Spain together led their armies to attack Lombardy, a Prince, for the reasons given, must take a side. Nor let it be supposed that any State can choose for itself a perfectly safe line of policy. On the contrary, it must reckon on every course which it may take being doubtful; for it happens in all human affairs that we never seek to escape one mischief without falling into another. Prudence therefore consists in knowing how to distinguish degrees of disadvantage, and in accepting a less evil as a good.<br /><br />Again, a Prince should show himself a patron of merit, and should honour those who excel in every art. He ought accordingly to encourage his subjects by enabling them to pursue their callings, whether mercantile, agricultural, or any other, in security, so that this man shall not be deterred from beautifying his possessions from the apprehension that they may be taken from him, or that other refrain from opening a trade through fear of taxes; and he should provide rewards for those who desire so to employ themselves, and for all who are disposed in any way to add to the greatness of his City or State.<br /><br />He ought, moreover, at suitable seasons of the year to entertain the people with festivals and shows. And because all cities are divided into guilds and companies, he should show attention to these societies, and sometimes take part in their meetings; offering an example of courtesy and munificence, but always maintaining the dignity of his station, which must under no circumstances be compromised.<br /><br />'", "id": 133, "section_id": 158},{"content": " '<br /><br />Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,<br />&nbsp;

Whether they shall be good or no depends on his prudence, so that the readiest conjecture we can form of the character and sagacity of a Prince, is from seeing what sort of men he has about him. When they are at once capable and faithful, we may always account him wise, since he has known to recognize their merit and to retain their fidelity. But if they be otherwise, we must pronounce unfavourably of him, since he has committed a first fault in making this selection.<br /><br />There was none who knew Messer Antonio of Venafro, as Minister of Pandolfo Petrucci, Lord of Siena, but thought Pandolfo a most prudent ruler in having him for his servant. And since there are three scales of intelligence, one which understands by itself, a second which understands what is shown it by others, and a third which understands neither by itself nor on the showing of others, the first of which is most excellent, the second good, but the third worthless, we must needs admit that if Pandolfo was not in the first of these degrees, he was in the second; for when one has the judgment to discern the good from the bad in what another says or does, though he be devoid of invention, he can recognize the merits and demerits of his servant, and will commend the former while he corrects the latter. The servant cannot hope to deceive such a master, and will continue good.<br /><br />As to how a Prince is to know his Minister, this unerring rule may be laid down. When you see a Minister thinking more of himself than of you, and in all his actions seeking his own ends, that man can never be a good Minister or one that you can trust. For he who has the charge of the State committed to him, ought not to think of himself, but only of his Prince, and should never bring to the notice of the latter what does not directly concern him. On the other hand, to keep his Minister good, the Prince should be considerate of him, dignifying him, enriching him, binding him to himself by benefits, and sharing with him the honours as well as the burthens of the State, so that the abundant honours and wealth bestowed upon him may divert him from seeking them at other hands; while the great responsibilities wherewith he is charged may lead him to dread change, knowing that he cannot stand alone without his master&rsquo;s support. When Prince and Minister are upon this footing they can mutually trust one another; but when the contrary is the case, it will always fare ill with one or other of them.<br /><br /><br />'", "id": 135, "section_id": 160},{"content": " '<br /><br />Because the charity of my native place<br />&nbsp;

Whence I perceived that there the passage was.<br /><br />\"In all the rest which I have shown to thee<br />&nbsp; Since we have entered in within the gate<br />&nbsp; Whose threshold unto no one is denied,<br /><br />Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes<br />&nbsp; So notable as is the present river,<br />&nbsp; Which all the little flames above it quenches.\"<br /><br />These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him<br />&nbsp; That he would give me largess of the food,<br />&nbsp; For which he had given me largess of desire.<br /><br />\"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,\"<br />&nbsp; Said he thereafterward, \"whose name is Crete,<br />&nbsp; Under whose king the world of old was chaste.<br /><br />There is a mountain there, that once was glad<br />&nbsp; With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;<br />&nbsp; Now ''tis deserted, as a thing worn out.<br /><br />Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle<br />&nbsp; Of her own son; and to conceal him better,<br />&nbsp; Whene''er he cried, she there had clamours made.<br /><br />A grand old man stands in the mount erect,<br />&nbsp; Who holds his shoulders turned tow''rds Damietta,<br />&nbsp; And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.<br /><br />His head is fashioned of refined gold,<br />&nbsp; And of pure silver are the arms and breast;<br />&nbsp; Then he is brass as far down as the fork.<br /><br />From that point downward all is chosen iron,<br />&nbsp; Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,<br />&nbsp; And more he stands on that than on the other.<br /><br />Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure<br />&nbsp; Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,<br />&nbsp; Which gathered together perforate that cavern.<br /><br />From rock to rock they fall into this valley;<br />&nbsp; Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;<br />&nbsp; Then downward go along this narrow sluice<br /><br />Unto that point where is no more descending.<br />&nbsp; They form Cocytus; what that pool may be<br />&nbsp; Thou shalt behold, so here ''tis not narrated.\"<br /><br />And I to him: \"If so the present runnel<br />&nbsp; Doth take its rise in this way from our world,<br />&nbsp; Why only on this verge appears it to us?\"<br /><br />And he to me: \"Thou knowest the place is round,<br />&nbsp; And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,<br />&nbsp; Still to the left descending to the bottom,<br /><br />Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.<br />&nbsp; Therefore if something new appear to us,<br />&nbsp; It should not bring amazement to thy face.\"<br /><br />And I again: \"Master, where shall be found<br />&nbsp; Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou''rt silent,<br />&nbsp; And sayest the other of this rain is made?\"<br /><br />\"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,\"<br />&nbsp; Replied he; \"but the boiling of the red<br />&nbsp; Water might well solve one of them thou makest.<br /><br />Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,<br />&nbsp; There where the souls repair to lave themselves,<br />&nbsp; When sin repented of has been removed.\"<br /><br />Then said he: \"It is time now to abandon<br />&nbsp; The wood; take heed that thou come after me;<br />&nbsp; A way the margins make that are not burning,<br /><br />And over them all vapours are extinguished.\"<br />'", "id": 136, "section_id": 161},
