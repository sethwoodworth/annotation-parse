<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Two</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest daughter.</p><p>The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ______________ regiment ofinfantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure,hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholyremembrance of him dying in action abroad&mdash;of his widow sinking underconsumption and grief soon afterwards&mdash;and this girl.</p><p>By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, onlosing her mother, she became the property, the charge, theconsolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemedevery probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her beingtaught only what very limited means could command, and growing up withno advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on whatnature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, andwarm-hearted, well-meaning relations.</p><p>But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave achange to her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highlyregarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man;and farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during asevere camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claimswhich he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away fromthe death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put anything in his power. When he did return, he sought out the child andtook notice of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, agirl, about Jane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them longvisits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine yearsold, his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being areal friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell ofundertaking the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; andfrom that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, andhad lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from timeto time.</p><p>The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; thevery few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father makingindependence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out ofColonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay andappointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be allhis daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to besupplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.</p><p>Such was Jane Fairfax's history. She had fallen into good hands,known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given anexcellent education. Living constantly with right-minded andwell-informed people, her heart and understanding had received everyadvantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residencebeing in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, bythe attendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilitieswere equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen ornineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for thecare of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself;but she was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father normother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evilday was put off. It was easy to decide that she was still too young;and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all therational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture ofhome and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the soberingsuggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all thismight soon be over.</p><p>The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of MissCampbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from thecircumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty andacquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseenby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt bythe parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, tillthe marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which sooften defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction towhat is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged theaffections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost assoon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled,while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.</p><p>This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing tobe yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on herpath of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgmenthad fixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twentyshould be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, shehad resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retirefrom all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society,peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.</p><p>The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such aresolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, noexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; andfor their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but thiswould be selfishness:&mdash;what must be at last, had better be soon.Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to haveresisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste ofsuch enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still,however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for nothurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well sincethe time of their daughter's marriage; and till she should havecompletely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engagingin duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frameand varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to bedischarged with tolerable comfort.</p><p>With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account toher aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truthsnot told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence toHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty withthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, thatthey depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for therecovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that shewas to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfectnovelty which had been so long promised it&mdash;Mr. Frank Churchill&mdash;mustput up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only thefreshness of a two years' absence.</p><p>Emma was sorry;&mdash;to have to pay civilities to a person she did notlike through three long months!&mdash;to be always doing more than shewished, and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfaxmight be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once toldher it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman,which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation hadbeen eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments ofself-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her.But "she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how itwas, but there was such coldness and reserve&mdash; such apparentindifference whether she pleased or not&mdash;and then, her aunt was such aneternal talker!&mdash;and she was made such a fuss with by every body!&mdash;andit had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate&mdash;becausetheir ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fondof each other." These were her reasons&mdash; she had no better.</p><p>It was a dislike so little just&mdash;every imputed fault was somagnified by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first timeafter any considerable absence, without feeling that she had injuredher; and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a twoyears' interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearanceand manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herselfthe highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such asalmost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemedto point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel allthis; and then, her face&mdash;her features&mdash; there was more beauty in themaltogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was verypleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes andeyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which shehad been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness anddelicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty,of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, inhonour, by all her principles, admire it:&mdash;elegance, which, whether ofperson or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to bevulgar, was distinction, and merit.</p><p>In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfaxwith twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense ofrendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike her nolonger. When she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well asher beauty; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to,what she was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemedimpossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, ifto every well-known particular entitling her to interest, were addedthe highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, whichshe had so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could bemore pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolvedon. Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr.Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which herimagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it might besimple, single, successless love on her side alone. She might have beenunconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of hisconversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving todivide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soonbeginning her career of laborious duty.</p><p>Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitablefeelings, as made her look around in walking home, and lament thatHighbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.</p><p>These were charming feelings&mdash;but not lasting. Before she hadcommitted herself by any public profession of eternal friendship forJane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices anderrors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, "She certainly is handsome; sheis better than handsome!" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield withher grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into itsusual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresomeas ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added toadmiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description ofexactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and howsmall a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions ofnew caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane'soffences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and thethanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her anaffectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew offin higher style her own very superior performance. She was, besides,which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no gettingat her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemeddetermined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciouslyreserved.</p><p>If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was morereserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. Sheseemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, orher own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of thematch. It was all general approbation and smoothness; nothingdelineated or distinguished. It did her no service however. Her cautionwas thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her firstsurmises. There probably <i>was</i> something more to conceal than herown preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing onefriend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sakeof the future twelve thousand pounds.</p><p>The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. FrankChurchill had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that theywere a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information couldEmma procure as to what he truly was. "Was he handsome?"&mdash;"She believedhe was reckoned a very fine young man." "Was he agreeable?"&mdash; "He wasgenerally thought so." "Did he appear a sensible young man; a young manof information?"&mdash;"At a watering-place, or in a common Londonacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners wereall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge thanthey had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found hismanners pleasing." Emma could not forgive her.</p></body>
