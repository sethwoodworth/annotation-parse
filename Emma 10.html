<span id = 102 ></span><span id = 103 ><p>Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable homeand happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings ofexistence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with verylittle to distress or vex her.</p><p>She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother haddied too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembranceof her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent womanas governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.</p><p>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, lessas a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, butparticularly of Emma. Between <i>them</i> it was more the intimacy ofsisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal officeof governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her toimpose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passedaway, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutuallyattached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming MissTaylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.</p><p>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of havingrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little toowell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy toher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present sounperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes withher.</p><p>Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of anydisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor'sloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of thisbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of anycontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her fatherand herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third tocheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep afterdinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what shehad lost.</p><p>The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Westonwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, andpleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering withwhat self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished andpromoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The wantof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled herpast kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how shehad taught and how she had played with her from five years old--how shehad devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health--and hownursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt ofgratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followedIsabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet adearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion suchas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowingall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, andpeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme ofhers--one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and whohad such an affection for her as could never find fault.</p><p>How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend wasgoing only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must bethe difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and aMiss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural anddomestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectualsolitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.</p><p>The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhousehad not married early) was much increased by his constitution andhabits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activityof mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; andthough everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and hisamiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.</p><p>Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond herdaily reach; and many a long October and November evening must bestruggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visitfrom Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill thehouse, and give her pleasant society again.</p><p>Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to atown, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, andshrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. TheWoodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. Shehad many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universallycivil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of MissTaylor for even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma couldnot but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her fatherawoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits requiredsupport. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every bodythat he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change ofevery kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was alwaysdisagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his owndaughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion,though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was nowobliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentleselfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people couldfeel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think MissTaylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would havebeen a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life atHartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keephim from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for himnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner,</p><p>"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"</p><p>"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston issuch a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughlydeserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live withus for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a houseof her own?"</p><p>"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of herown? This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,my dear."</p><p>"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We shall be always meeting! <i>We</i> must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon."</p><p>"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could not walk half so far."</p><p>"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to be sure."</p><p>"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for sucha little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are payingour visit?"</p><p>"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we havesettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston lastnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like goingto Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I onlydoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till youmentioned her--James is so obliged to you!"</p><p>"I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I wouldnot have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and Iam sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her,she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; andwhen you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turnsthe lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure shewill be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poorMiss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see.Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will behearing of us. He will be able to tell her how we all are."</p><p>Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, andhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably throughthe evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. Thebackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwardswalked in and made it unnecessary.</p><p>Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, wasnot only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularlyconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He livedabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from theirmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, aftersome days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all werewell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, whichalways did him good; and his many inquiries after "poor Isabella" andher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.Woodhouse gratefully observed, "It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you musthave had a shocking walk."</p><p>"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire."</p><p>"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch cold."</p><p>"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them."</p><p>"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rainhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were atbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding."</p><p>"By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware ofwhat sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry withmy congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How didyou all behave? Who cried most?"</p><p>"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business."</p><p>"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possiblysay `poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; butwhen it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At anyrate, it must be better to have only one to please than two."</p><p>"Especially when <i>one</i> of those two is such a fanciful,troublesome creature!" said Emma playfully. "That is what you have inyour head, I know--and what you would certainly say if my father werenot by."</p><p>"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed," said Mr. Woodhouse,with a sigh. "I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."</p><p>"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean <i>you</i>, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean <i>you</i>.What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only myself. Mr. Knightley lovesto find fault with me, you know-- in a joke--it is all a joke. Wealways say what we like to one another."</p><p>Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could seefaults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, sheknew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not havehim really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfectby every body.</p><p>"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightley, "but I meantno reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have twopersons to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that shemust be a gainer."</p><p>"Well," said Emma, willing to let it pass--"you want to hear aboutthe wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behavedcharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt thatwe were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meetingevery day."</p><p>"Dear Emma bears every thing so well," said her father. "But, Mr.Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I amsure she <i>will</i> miss her more than she thinks for."</p><p>Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. "It isimpossible that Emma should not miss such a companion," said Mr.Knightley. "We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we couldsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor'sadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor'stime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important toher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allowherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylormust be glad to have her so happily married."</p><p>"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me," said Emma, "and avery considerable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match,you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved inthe right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,may comfort me for any thing."</p><p>Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, "Ah!my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, forwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any morematches."</p><p>"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And aftersuch success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would nevermarry again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long,and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantlyoccupied either in his business in town or among his friends here,always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful-- Mr. Weston neednot spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Ohno! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people eventalked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the sonand the uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talkedon the subject, but I believed none of it.</p><p>"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and Imet with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, hedarted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for usfrom Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned thematch from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in thisinstance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave offmatch-making."</p><p>"I do not understand what you mean by `success,'" said Mr.Knightley. "Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly anddelicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four yearsto bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady'smind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as youcall it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idleday, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr.Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every nowand then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit?What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and <i>that</i> is all that can be said."</p><p>"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a luckyguess?-- I pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it alucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it.And as to my poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not knowthat I am so entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn twopretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something betweenthe do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston'svisits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed manylittle matters, it might not have come to any thing after all. I thinkyou must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that."</p><p>"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage theirown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, thangood to them, by interference."</p><p>"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,"rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. "But, my dear, praydo not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one'sfamily circle grievously."</p><p>"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You likeMr. Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobodyin Highbury who deserves him--and he has been here a whole year, andhas fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame tohave him single any longer--and I thought when he was joining theirhands to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have thesame kind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and thisis the only way I have of doing him a service."</p><p>"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very goodyoung man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shewhim any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be sokind as to meet him."</p><p>"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time," said Mr.Knightley, laughing, "and I agree with you entirely, that it will be amuch better thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the bestof the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care ofhimself."</p></span><span id = 104 ><p>Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectablefamily, which for the last two or three generations had been risinginto gentility and property. He had received a good education, but, onsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposedfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper byentering into the militia of his county, then embodied.</p><p>Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of hismilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a greatYorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody wassurprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, andwho were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.</p><p>Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command ofher fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to thefamily-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it tookplace, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, whothrew her off with due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and didnot produce much happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it,for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him thinkevery thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being inlove with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not thebest. She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of herbrother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at thatbrother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of herformer home. They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothingin comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, butshe wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchillof Enscombe.</p><p>Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by theChurchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have muchthe worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years'marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child tomaintain. From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illnessof his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr.and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any otheryoung creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the wholecharge of the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples andsome reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but asthey were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up tothe care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his owncomfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.</p><p>A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militiaand engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good wayin London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concernwhich brought just employment enough. He had still a small house inHighbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between usefuloccupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twentyyears of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time,realised an easy competence--enough to secure the purchase of a littleestate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for--enough tomarry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live accordingto the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.</p><p>It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence hisschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, ithad not shaken his determination of never settling till he couldpurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they wereaccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtainedhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with everyprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He hadnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightfula well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him thepleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to bechosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.</p><p>He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was hisown; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as hisuncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assumethe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely,therefore, that he should ever want his father's assistance. His fatherhad no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, andgoverned her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature toimagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,and, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year inLondon, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fineyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He waslooked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits andprospects a kind of common concern.</p><p>Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a livelycuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so littlereturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visithis father had been often talked of but never achieved.</p><p>Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, asa most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There wasnot a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry dranktea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned thevisit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; andthe hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to hisnew mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit inHighbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston hadreceived. "I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. FrankChurchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a veryhandsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse sawthe letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in hislife."</p><p>It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasingattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a mostwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulationwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a mostfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunateshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partialseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, andwho could ill bear to part with her.</p><p>She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering anhour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma wasof no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation than mostgirls would have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits thatmight be hoped would bear her well and happily through its littledifficulties and privations. And then there was such comfort in thevery easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for evensolitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's disposition andcircumstances, which would make the approaching season no hindrance totheir spending half the evenings in the week together.</p><p>Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude toMrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--hermore than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and soapparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes takenby surprize at his being still able to pity `poor Miss Taylor,' whenthey left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, orsaw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to acarriage of her own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse'sgiving a gentle sigh, and saying, "Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would bevery glad to stay."</p><p>There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasingto pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased bybeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, whichhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach couldbear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to bedifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded asunfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuadethem from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, asearnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at thepains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr.Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits wereone of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the biasof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree withmany--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such anopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influenceevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.</p><p>There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrysbeing seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands:but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.</p></span><span id = 105 ><p>Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very muchto have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from hisfortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits ofhis own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not muchintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of latehours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintancebut such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him,Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey inthe parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended manysuch. Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of thechosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what hepreferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal tocompany, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma couldnot make up a card-table for him.</p><p>Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, theprivilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitudefor the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and thesmiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.</p><p>After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whomwere Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost alwaysat the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetchedand carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardshipfor either James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, itwould have been a grievance.</p><p>Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very oldlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with hersingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all theregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untowardcircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degreeof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for havingmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority tomake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her intooutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Heryouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life wasdevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make asmall income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, anda woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universalgood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She lovedevery body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted toevery body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, andsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many goodneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. Thesimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and gratefulspirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity toherself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactlysuited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmlessgossip.</p><p>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or anestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences ofrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegantmorality, upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladiesfor enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but areal, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonablequantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and wheregirls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves intoa little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.Goddard's school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highburywas reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house andgarden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run abouta great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains withher own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple nowwalked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled tothe occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much toMr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave herneat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and winor lose a few sixpences by his fireside.</p><p>These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently ableto collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power;though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for theabsence of Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father lookcomfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving thingsso well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel thatevery evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she hadfearfully anticipated.</p><p>As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close ofthe present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, inmost respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; amost welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emmaknew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on accountof her beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the eveningno longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.</p><p>Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody hadplaced her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebodyhad lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that ofparlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, andwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some youngladies who had been at school there with her.</p><p>She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sortwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with afine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look ofgreat sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as muchpleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined tocontinue the acquaintance.</p><p>She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith'sconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--notinconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantlygrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed bythe appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she hadbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all thosenatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society ofHighbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formedwere unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, thoughvery good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family ofthe name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting alarge farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish ofDonwell--very creditably, she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thoughthighly of them--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfitto be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledgeand elegance to be quite perfect. <i>She</i> would notice her; shewould improve her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, andintroduce her into good society; she would form her opinions and hermanners. It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kindundertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure,and powers.</p><p>She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking andlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that theevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, whichalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit andwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards tothe fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the commonimpulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit ofdoing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of amind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours ofthe meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scallopedoysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to theearly hours and civil scruples of their guests.</p><p>Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sadwarfare. He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been thefashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being veryunwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and whilehis hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, hiscare for their health made him grieve that they would eat.</p><p>Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that hecould, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he mightconstrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicerthings, to say:</p><p>"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. Anegg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling anegg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by anybody else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, yousee--one of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma helpyou to a <i>little</i> bit of tart--a <i>very</i> little bit. Ours areall apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here.I do not advise the custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to <i>half</i> a glass of wine? A <i>small</i> half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with you."</p><p>Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a muchmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particularpleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith wasquite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personagein Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as muchpanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off withhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with whichMiss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shakenhands with her at last!</p></span><span id = 107 ><p>Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting,encouraging, and telling her to come very often; and as theiracquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As awalking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she mightfind her. In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Herfather never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of theground sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the yearvaried; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too muchconfined. She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was notpleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon atany time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges. Butin every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her, and wasconfirmed in all her kind designs.</p><p>Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiringto be guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment toherself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, andpower of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that therewas no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not beexpected. Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's beingexactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the something which herhome required. Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question.Two such could never be granted. Two such she did not want. It wasquite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent.Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitudeand esteem. Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.</p><p>Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find outwho were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tellevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emmawas obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe thatin the same situation <i>she</i> should not have discovered the truth.Harriet had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believejust what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.</p><p>Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of theschool in general, formed naturally a great part of theconversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins ofAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupiedher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months withthem, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describethe many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged hertalkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings, andenjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so muchexultation of Mrs. Martin's having "<i>two</i> parlours, two very goodparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard'sdrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had livedfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two ofthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welchcow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, itshould be called <i>her</i> cow; and of their having a very handsomesummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all todrink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozenpeople."</p><p>For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediatecause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelingsarose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother anddaughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when itappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and wasalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doingsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor littlefriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she werenot taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.</p><p>With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number andmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready tospeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merryevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so verygood-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day inorder to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she wasof them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had hisshepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.She was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. Shebelieved he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a veryfine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for hiswool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke wellof him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin hadtold her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it wasimpossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,whenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she <i>wanted</i> him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.</p><p>"Well done, Mrs. Martin!" thought Emma. "You know what you are about."</p><p>"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to sendMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had everseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the threeteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup withher."</p><p>"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business? He does not read?"</p><p>"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has read agood deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He reads theAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of thewindow seats--but he reads all <i>them</i> to himself. But sometimesof an evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloudout of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has readthe Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, norThe Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before Imentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever hecan."</p><p>The next question was--</p><p>"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?"</p><p>"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him very plain atfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every nowand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way toKingston. He has passed you very often."</p><p>"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but withouthaving any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or onfoot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. Theyeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can havenothing to do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance mightinterest me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way orother. But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in onesense, as much above my notice as in every other he is below it."</p><p>"To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight."</p><p>"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imaginehis age to be?"</p><p>"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd."</p><p>"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother isperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable asthey are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she wouldprobably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sortof young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, itmight be very desirable."</p><p>"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!"</p><p>"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who arenot born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortuneentirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatevermoney he might come into when his father died, whatever his share ofthe family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in hisstock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he maybe rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realisedany thing yet."</p><p>"To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have noindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talksof taking a boy another year."</p><p>"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he doesmarry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though hissisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objectedto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for youto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularlycareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being agentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that stationby every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of peoplewho would take pleasure in degrading you."</p><p>"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit atHartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraidof what any body can do."</p><p>"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but Iwould have you so firmly established in good society, as to beindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see youpermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable tohave as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that ifyou should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish youmay not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquaintedwith the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter,without education."</p><p>"To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry anybody but what had had some education--and been very well brought up.However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's--and I amsure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall alwayshave a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, andshould be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as welleducated as me. But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it."</p><p>Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw noalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer,but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be noserious difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendlyarrangement of her own.</p><p>They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on theDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully ather, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma wasnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a fewyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eyesufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was veryneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had noother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, shethought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet'sinclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarilynoticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.</p><p>They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must notbe kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smilingface, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soonto compose.</p><p>"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It wasquite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He didnot think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towardsRandalls most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of theForest yet. He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that hequite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we shouldhappen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected?What do you think of him? Do you think him so very plain?"</p><p>"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that isnothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right toexpect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he couldbe so very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, Iconfess, a degree or two nearer gentility."</p><p>"To be sure," said Harriet, in a mortified voice, "he is not so genteel as real gentlemen."</p><p>"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have beenrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that youmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. AtHartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bredmen. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be incompany with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a veryinferior creature--and rather wondering at yourself for having everthought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkwardlook and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard tobe wholly unmodulated as I stood here."</p><p>"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine airand way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough.But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"</p><p>"Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with <i>him</i>. You might not see one in a hundred with <i>gentleman</i>so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the onlygentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston andMr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of <i>them</i>. Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You must see the difference."</p><p>"Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."</p><p>"Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a persongrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should notbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, orawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in laterage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.Weston's time of life?"</p><p>"There is no saying, indeed," replied Harriet rather solemnly.</p><p>"But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completelygross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinkingof nothing but profit and loss."</p><p>"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad."</p><p>"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from thecircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thingelse--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he todo with books? And I have no doubt that he <i>will</i> thrive, and be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb <i>us</i>."</p><p>"I wonder he did not remember the book"--was all Harriet's answer,and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought mightbe safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time.Her next beginning was,</p><p>"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr.Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might bemore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in <i>him</i>,because there is so much good-humour with it--but that would not do tobe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commandingsort of manner, though it suits <i>him</i> very well; his figure, andlook, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man wereto set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary,I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Eltonas a model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not knowwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners aresofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be toplease you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?"</p><p>She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn fromMr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.</p><p>Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the youngfarmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellentmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for herto have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every bodyelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that anybody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it hadentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming toHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense ofits expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite thegentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not ofany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficientincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was knownto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of himas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without anydeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.</p><p>She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet abeautiful girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings atHartfield, was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's therecould be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him wouldhave all the usual weight and efficacy. And he was really a verypleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious mightlike. He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired ingeneral, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of featurewhich she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratifiedby a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts for hermight very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.</p></span><span id = 108 ><p>"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston," said Mr.Knightley, "of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, butI think it a bad thing."</p><p>"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?"</p><p>"I think they will neither of them do the other any good."</p><p>"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying herwith a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. Ihave been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How verydifferently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good! Thiswill certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.Knightley."</p><p>"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowingWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle."</p><p>"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for hethinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it onlyyesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that thereshould be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr.Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. Youare so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of acompanion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort awoman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used toit all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She isnot the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be. But onthe other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be aninducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. Shemeans it, I know."</p><p>"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve yearsold. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various timesof books that she meant to read regularly through--and very good liststhey were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimesalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew upwhen only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so muchcredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have madeout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course ofsteady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiringindustry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to theunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safelyaffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuadeher to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not."</p><p>"I dare say," replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "that I thought so <i>then</i>;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting to do any thing I wished."</p><p>"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as <i>that</i>,"--saidMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. "But I,"he soon added, "who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, muststill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverestof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being ableto answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She wasalways quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever sinceshe was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. Inher mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inheritsher mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her."</p><p>"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on <i>your</i>recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted anothersituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me toany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held."</p><p>"Yes," said he, smiling. "You are better placed <i>here</i>; veryfit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparingyourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers wouldseem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from <i>her</i>,on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, anddoing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him awife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor."</p><p>"Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston."</p><p>"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, andthat with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonnessof comfort, or his son may plague him."</p><p>"I hope not <i>that</i>.--It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not foretell vexation from that quarter."</p><p>"Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend toEmma's genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart,the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill infortune.--But Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possiblyhave. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing everything. She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emmaimagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presentingsuch a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture tosay that <i>she</i> cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield willonly put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to.She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those amongwhom birth and circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistakenif Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make agirl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation inlife.--They only give a little polish."</p><p>"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am moreanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.How well she looked last night!"</p><p>"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty."</p><p>"Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?"</p><p>"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I haveseldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am apartial old friend."</p><p>"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regularfeatures, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of fullhealth, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and uprightfigure! There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, herhead, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture ofhealth;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the completepicture of grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, isnot she?"</p><p>"I have not a fault to find with her person," he replied. "I thinkher all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add thispraise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how veryhandsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanitylies another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislikeof Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm."</p><p>"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its notdoing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she is anexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kindersister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may betrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make nolasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundredtimes."</p><p>"Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel,and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John andIsabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blindaffection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is notquite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having theiropinions with me."</p><p>"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust orunkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I considermyself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech thatEmma's mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do notthink any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy beingmade a matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; butsupposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from theintimacy, it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody buther father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an endto it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself. It has been somany years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office."</p><p>"Not at all," cried he; "I am much obliged to you for it. It is verygood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has oftenfound; for it shall be attended to."</p><p>"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about her sister."</p><p>"Be satisfied," said he, "I will not raise any outcry. I will keepmy ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma.Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greaterinterest; perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity inwhat one feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!"</p><p>"So do I," said Mrs. Weston gently, "very much."</p><p>"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, meansjust nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen aman she cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very muchin love with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and insome doubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobodyhereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home."</p><p>"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break herresolution at present," said Mrs. Weston, "as can well be; and whileshe is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming anyattachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr.Woodhouse's account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma,though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you."</p><p>Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of herown and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There werewishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirableto have them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightleysoon afterwards made to "What does Weston think of the weather; shallwe have rain?" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmiseabout Hartfield.</p></span><span id = 109 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a properdirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very goodpurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of hisadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident ofcreating as much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be anyoccasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in thefairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had noscruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her sowarmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a littletime would not add. His perception of the striking improvement ofHarriet's manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one ofthe least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.</p><p>"You have given Miss Smith all that she required," said he; "youhave made her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when shecame to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added areinfinitely superior to what she received from nature."</p><p>"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet onlywanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had allthe natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. Ihave done very little."</p><p>"If it were admissible to contradict a lady," said the gallant Mr. Elton--</p><p>"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, havetaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before."</p><p>"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!"</p><p>"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition more truly amiable."</p><p>"I have no doubt of it." And it was spoken with a sort of sighinganimation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleasedanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,to have Harriet's picture.</p><p>"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?" said she: "did you ever sit for your picture?"</p><p>Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say, with a very interesting naivete,</p><p>"Oh! dear, no, never."</p><p>No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,</p><p>"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! Iwould give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likenessmyself. You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I hada great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of myfriends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But fromone cause or another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I couldalmost venture, if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delightto have her picture!"</p><p>"Let me entreat you," cried Mr. Elton; "it would indeed be adelight! Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming atalent in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. Howcould you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens ofyour landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitablefigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?"</p><p>Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do withtaking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be inraptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. "Well, ifyou give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall trywhat I can do. Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes alikeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of theeye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch."</p><p>"Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--Ihave not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will doit, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession."</p><p>"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. Shethinks so little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner ofanswering me? How completely it meant, `why should my picture bedrawn?'"</p><p>"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded."</p><p>Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediatelymade; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes againstthe earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to workdirectly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her variousattempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, thatthey might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her manybeginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She hadalways wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both indrawing and music than many might have done with so little labour asshe would ever submit to. She played and sang;--and drew in almostevery style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing hadshe approached the degree of excellence which she would have been gladto command, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceivedas to her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was notunwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation foraccomplishment often higher than it deserved.</p><p>There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps themost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or hadthere been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her twocompanions would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. Alikeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must becapital.</p><p>"No great variety of faces for you," said Emma. "I had only my ownfamily to study from. There is my father--another of my father--but theidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could onlytake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Westonagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always mykindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegantfigure!--and the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness ofher, if she would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to haveme draw her four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here comeall my attempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henryand John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any oneof them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have themdrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of threeor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to takeany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they arecoarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is mysketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping onthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you wouldwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That'svery like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofais very good. Then here is my last,"--unclosing a pretty sketch of agentleman in small size, whole-length--"my last and my best--mybrother, Mr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished,when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take anotherlikeness. I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, andwhen I had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and Iwere quite agreed in thinking it <i>very</i> like)--only toohandsome--too flattering--but that was a fault on the right side--afterall this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of--"Yes, it was alittle like--but to be sure it did not do him justice." We had had agreat deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all. It was made agreat favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and so Inever would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourablelikeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and, as Isaid, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again. But forHarriet's sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands andwives in the case <i>at</i> <i>present</i>, I will break my resolution now."</p><p>Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, andwas repeating, "No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, asyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives," with so interesting aconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not betterleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, thedeclaration must wait a little longer.</p><p>She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be awhole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and wasdestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourablestation over the mantelpiece.</p><p>The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid ofnot keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweetmixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. Butthere was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her andwatching every touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself wherehe might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged toput an end to it, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It thenoccurred to her to employ him in reading.</p><p>"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindnessindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessenthe irksomeness of Miss Smith's."</p><p>Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew inpeace. She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; anything less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he wasready at the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and seethe progress, and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with suchan encourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almostbefore it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love andhis complaisance were unexceptionable.</p><p>The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enoughpleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no wantof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meantto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little moreheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of itsbeing in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling itsdestined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of thebeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; withas many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promisingattachment was likely to add.</p><p>Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as heought, entreated for the permission of attending and reading to themagain.</p><p>"By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party."</p><p>The same civilities and courtesies, the same success andsatisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the wholeprogress of the picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who sawit was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defendedit through every criticism.</p><p>"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty shewanted,"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting thatshe was addressing a lover.--"The expression of the eye is mostcorrect, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is thefault of her face that she has them not."</p><p>"Do you think so?" replied he. "I cannot agree with you. It appearsto me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such alikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know."</p><p>"You have made her too tall, Emma," said Mr. Knightley.</p><p>Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,</p><p>"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider,she is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which inshort gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must be preserved,you know. Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it gives one exactlythe idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!"</p><p>"It is very pretty," said Mr. Woodhouse. "So prettily done! Just asyour drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws sowell as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that sheseems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over hershoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold."</p><p>"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer. Look at the tree."</p><p>"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear."</p><p>"You, sir, may say any thing," cried Mr. Elton, "but I must confessthat I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith outof doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Anyother situation would have been much less in character. The naivete ofMiss Smith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is most admirable! Icannot keep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness."</p><p>The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were afew difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London;the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whosetaste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of allcommissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr.Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house inthe fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr.Elton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert."Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure shouldhe have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It wasimpossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed onsuch an errand."</p><p>"He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would notgive him such a troublesome office for the world,"--brought on thedesired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very fewminutes settled the business.</p><p>Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, andgive the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensureits safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearfulof not being incommoded enough.</p><p>"What a precious deposit!" said he with a tender sigh, as he received it.</p><p>"This man is almost too gallant to be in love," thought Emma. "Ishould say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different waysof being in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harrietexactly; it will be an `Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he doessigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I couldendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.But it is his gratitude on Harriet's account."</p></span><span id = 110 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a freshoccasion for Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been atHartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gonehome to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had beentalked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing somethingextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half aminute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back toMrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, andfinding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left alittle parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and onopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songswhich she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and thisletter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposalof marriage. "Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she didnot know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very goodletter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved hervery much--but she did not know--and so, she was come as fast as shecould to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.--" Emma washalf-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.</p><p>"Upon my word," she cried, "the young man is determined not to loseany thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can."</p><p>"Will you read the letter?" cried Harriet. "Pray do. I'd rather you would."</p><p>Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. Thestyle of the letter was much above her expectation. There were notmerely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not havedisgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong andunaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit ofthe writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it,while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a "Well,well," and was at last forced to add, "Is it a good letter? or is ittoo short?"</p><p>"Yes, indeed, a very good letter," replied Emma rather slowly--"sogood a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of hissisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom Isaw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, ifleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for awoman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a naturaltalent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when he takes a pen inhand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men.Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentimentsto a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet(returning it,) than I had expected."</p><p>"Well," said the still waiting Harriet;--"well--and--and what shall I do?"</p><p>"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this letter?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and speedily."</p><p>"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me."</p><p>"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You willexpress yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of yournot being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must beunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude andconcern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, willpresent themselves unbidden to <i>your</i> mind, I am persuaded. You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment."</p><p>"You think I ought to refuse him then," said Harriet, looking down.</p><p>"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you inany doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I havebeen under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, ifyou feel in doubt as to the <i>purport</i> of your answer. I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it."</p><p>Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:</p><p>"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."</p><p>"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What wouldyou advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought todo."</p><p>"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to dowith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings."</p><p>"I had no notion that he liked me so very much," said Harriet,contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in hersilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of thatletter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,</p><p>"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman <i>doubts</i>as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought torefuse him. If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought to say `No'directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtfulfeelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, andolder than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that Iwant to influence you."</p><p>"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if youwould just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--Asyou say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not behesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say `No,'perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?'"</p><p>"Not for the world," said Emma, smiling graciously, "would I adviseyou either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. Ifyou prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the mostagreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should youhesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at thismoment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceiveyourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At thismoment whom are you thinking of?"</p><p>The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turnedaway confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though theletter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted aboutwithout regard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not withoutstrong hopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said--</p><p>"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do aswell as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and reallyalmost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?"</p><p>"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing justwhat you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings tomyself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitationin approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would havegrieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been theconsequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallestdegree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would notinfluence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I couldnot have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I amsecure of you for ever."</p><p>Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly.</p><p>"You could not have visited me!" she cried, looking aghast. "No, tobe sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That wouldhave been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I wouldnot give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for anything in the world."</p><p>"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; butit must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all goodsociety. I must have given you up."</p><p>"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!"</p><p>"Dear affectionate creature!--<i>You</i> banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--<i>You</i>confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! Iwonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He musthave a pretty good opinion of himself."</p><p>"I do not think he is conceited either, in general," said Harriet,her conscience opposing such censure; "at least, he is very goodnatured, and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a greatregard for--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know,though he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainlyI must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and ifone comes to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparisonat all, <i>one</i> is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I doreally think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man, and have a greatopinion of him; and his being so much attached to me--and his writingsuch a letter--but as to leaving you, it is what I would not do uponany consideration."</p><p>"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not beparted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, orbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter."</p><p>"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too."</p><p>Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a "verytrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownishmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know thather husband could write a good letter."</p><p>"Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to bealways happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refusehim. But how shall I do? What shall I say?"</p><p>Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, andadvised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope ofher assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against anyassistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of everysentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, hadsuch a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to braceher up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very muchconcerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much ofwhat his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxiousthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if theyoung man had come in her way at that moment, he would have beenaccepted after all.</p><p>This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. Thebusiness was finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all theevening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimesrelieved them by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringingforward the idea of Mr. Elton.</p><p>"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again," was said in rather a sorrowful tone.</p><p>"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared toAbbey-Mill."</p><p>"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but at Hartfield."</p><p>Some time afterwards it was, "I think Mrs. Goddard would be verymuch surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nashwould--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it isonly a linen-draper."</p><p>"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in theteacher of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you suchan opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest wouldappear valuable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, Isuppose she is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain personcan hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancyyou and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners haveexplained themselves."</p><p>Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering thatpeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainlycheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towardsthe rejected Mr. Martin.</p><p>"Now he has got my letter," said she softly. "I wonder what they areall doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy, they will beunhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much."</p><p>"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are morecheerfully employed," cried Emma. "At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Eltonis shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how muchmore beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five orsix times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name."</p><p>"My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street."</p><p>"Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear littlemodest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-streettill just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion allthis evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to hisfamily, it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the partythose pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warmprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busytheir imaginations all are!"</p><p>Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.</p></span><span id = 111 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she hadbeen spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting tohave a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best inevery respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much aspossible just at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for anhour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that sheshould return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.</p><p>While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up hismind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, andwas induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples ofhis own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr.Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by hisshort, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologiesand civil hesitations of the other.</p><p>"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you willnot consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's adviceand go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I hadbetter take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people."</p><p>"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."</p><p>"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happyto entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and takemy three turns--my winter walk."</p><p>"You cannot do better, sir."</p><p>"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but Iam a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and,besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey."</p><p>"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the sooner <i>you</i> go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you."</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of beingimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for morechat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with morevoluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.</p><p>"I cannot rate her beauty as you do," said he; "but she is a prettylittle creature, and I am inclined to think very well of herdisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in goodhands she will turn out a valuable woman."</p><p>"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting."</p><p>"Come," said he, "you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tellyou that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl'sgiggle; she really does you credit."</p><p>"Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I hadbeen of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise wherethey may. <i>You</i> do not often overpower me with it."</p><p>"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?"</p><p>"Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she intended."</p><p>"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps."</p><p>"Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!"</p><p>"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would."</p><p>Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing. He presently added, with a smile,</p><p>"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell youthat I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear ofsomething to her advantage."</p><p>"Indeed! how so? of what sort?"</p><p>"A very serious sort, I assure you;" still smiling.</p><p>"Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love with her? Who makes you their confidant?"</p><p>Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knewMr. Elton looked up to him.</p><p>"I have reason to think," he replied, "that Harriet Smith will soonhave an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionablequarter:--Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, thissummer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love andmeans to marry her."</p><p>"He is very obliging," said Emma; "but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him?"</p><p>"Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He cameto the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. Heknows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, Ibelieve, considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask mewhether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved hischoice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her beingconsidered (especially since <i>your</i> making so much of her) as ina line of society above him. I was very much pleased with all that hesaid. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin. Healways speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very welljudging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and whatthey all proposed doing in the event of his marriage. He is anexcellent young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation inadvising him to marry. He proved to me that he could afford it; andthat being the case, I was convinced he could not do better. I praisedthe fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy. If he hadnever esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of methen; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend andcounsellor man ever had. This happened the night before last. Now, aswe may fairly suppose, he would not allow much time to pass before hespoke to the lady, and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday,it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and shemay be detained by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresomewretch."</p><p>"Pray, Mr. Knightley," said Emma, who had been smiling to herselfthrough a great part of this speech, "how do you know that Mr. Martindid not speak yesterday?"</p><p>"Certainly," replied he, surprized, "I do not absolutely know it; but it may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?"</p><p>"Come," said she, "I will tell you something, in return for what youhave told me. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and wasrefused."</p><p>This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as hestood up, in tall indignation, and said,</p><p>"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the foolish girl about?"</p><p>"Oh! to be sure," cried Emma, "it is always incomprehensible to aman that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man alwaysimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her."</p><p>"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is themeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it isso; but I hope you are mistaken."</p><p>"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer."</p><p>"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your doing. You persuaded her to refuse him."</p><p>"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should notfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprizedindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, hedoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were evergot over."</p><p>"Not Harriet's equal!" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, "No, he isnot her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as insituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What areHarriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to anyconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter ofnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, andcertainly no respectable relations. She is known only asparlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor agirl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is tooyoung and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age shecan have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likelyever to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is goodtempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was onhis account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not doworse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing totrust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort ofdisposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led arightand turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all onher side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that therewould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even <i>your</i>satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that youwould not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of herbeing settled so well. I remember saying to myself, `Even Emma, withall her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'"</p><p>"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to sayany such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and allhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimatefriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a manwhom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder youshould think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure youmine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.You are not just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated verydifferently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richestof the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank insociety.--The sphere in which she moves is much above his.--It would bea degradation."</p><p>"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!"</p><p>"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense shemay be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not topay for the offence of others, by being held below the level of thosewith whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that herfather is a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance isvery liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement orcomfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me;that she associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend,will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin."</p><p>"Whoever might be her parents," said Mr. Knightley, "whoever mayhave had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part oftheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs.Goddard's hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short, in Mrs.Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her friendsevidently thought this good enough for her; and it <i>was</i> goodenough. She desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn herinto a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor anyambition beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins inthe summer. She had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now,you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma.Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he had not feltpersuaded of her not being disinclined to him. I know him well. He hastoo much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfishpassion. And as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man Iknow. Depend upon it he had encouragement."</p><p>It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to thisassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subjectagain.</p><p>"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not socontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but shehas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to haveher understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point,however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty andgood-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for sheis, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-ninepeople out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much morephilosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsomefaces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty ofbeing admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing fromamong many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, isnot so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thoroughsweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and agreat readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very muchmistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and suchtemper, the highest claims a woman could possess."</p><p>"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, isalmost enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, thanmisapply it as you do."</p><p>"To be sure!" cried she playfully. "I know <i>that</i> is thefeeling of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly whatevery man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses and satisfieshis judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, everto marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, justentering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered atbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No--pray lether have time to look about her."</p><p>"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy," said Mr.Knightley presently, "though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but Inow perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. Youwill puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she hasa claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will begood enough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sortof mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise herexpectations too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers ofmarriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men ofsense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men offamily would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl ofsuch obscurity--and most prudent men would be afraid of theinconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mysteryof her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, andshe is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage herto expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothingless than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be aparlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest of her life--or, atleast, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,)till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the oldwriting-master's son."</p><p>"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, thatthere can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making eachother more angry. But as to my <i>letting</i> her marry Robert Martin,it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, asmust prevent any second application. She must abide by the evil ofhaving refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, Iwill not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but Iassure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. Hisappearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if sheever were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, thatbefore she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He wasthe brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; andaltogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his greatassistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find himdisagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what gentlemenare; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chancewith Harriet."</p><p>"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!" cried Mr.Knightley.--"Robert Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, andgood-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentilitythan Harriet Smith could understand."</p><p>Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, butwas really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself abetter judge of such a point of female right and refinement than hecould be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgmentin general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; andto have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was verydisagreeable. Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with onlyone attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made noanswer. He was thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last inthese words.</p><p>"Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I hopeit will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are bestknown to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love ofmatch-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projectsyou have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton isthe man, I think it will be all labour in vain."</p><p>Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,</p><p>"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort ofman, and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely tomake an imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well asany body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. Heis as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be withHarriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a greatfavourite wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking inunreserved moments, when there are only men present, I am convincedthat he does not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speakwith great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sistersare intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece."</p><p>"I am very much obliged to you," said Emma, laughing again. "If Ihad set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have beenvery kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harrietto myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope toequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well."</p><p>"Good morning to you,"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly. Hewas very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, andwas mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanctionhe had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in theaffair, was provoking him exceedingly.</p><p>Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was moreindistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not alwaysfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced thather opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. Hewalked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. Shewas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time andthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet'sstaying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibilityof the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meetingwith Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dreadof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and whenHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any suchreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction whichsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.Knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing whichwoman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.</p><p>He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when sheconsidered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she haddone, neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tellherself, in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill ofsuch an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken ithastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather saidwhat he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew any thingabout. He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with moreunreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not be of animprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he mightnaturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them; but then, Mr.Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strongpassion at war with all interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no suchpassion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw toomuch of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that areasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than areasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did notbelong to Mr. Elton.</p><p>Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash hadbeen telling her something, which she repeated immediately with greatdelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he wascoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, andfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road toLondon, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was thewhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.Perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby itwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very muchto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would notdo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a <i>very</i> <i>particular</i>way indeed, that he was going on business which he would not put offfor any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviablecommission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious. Mr.Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there mustbe a <i>lady</i> in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton onlylooked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits. MissNash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more about Mr.Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her, "that she didnot pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only knewthat any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should think theluckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not hisequal for beauty or agreeableness."</p></span><span id = 112 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" />Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel withherself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usualbefore he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his gravelooks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could notrepent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and morejustified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the nextfew days.</p><p>The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the commonsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his halfsentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet'sfeelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong andsteady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma wassoon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered,than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantageto the latter.</p><p>Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal ofuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a fewfirst chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was mucheasier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imaginationrange and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlargeher comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literarypursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision shewas making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribingall the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thinquarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented withciphers and trophies.</p><p>In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scaleare not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, hadwritten out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken thefirst hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get agreat many more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste;and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be anarrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as thegirls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their puttingin. "So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--hewondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time."And it always ended in "Kitty, a fair but frozen maid."</p><p>His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he haddesired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,something, he thought, might come from that quarter.</p><p>It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects ofHighbury in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was theonly one whose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute anyreally good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect;and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with hisrecollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, mostearnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathea compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to him theirtwo or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which atlast he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-knowncharade,</p><pre>   My first doth affliction denote,<br />     Which my second is destin'd to feel<br />   And my whole is the best antidote<br />     That affliction to soften and heal.--<br /></pre><p>made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already.</p><p>"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?" said she;"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could beeasier to you."</p><p>"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind inhis life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even MissWoodhouse"--he stopt a moment--"or Miss Smith could inspire him."</p><p>The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. Hecalled for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the tablecontaining, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressedto a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from hismanner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.</p><p>"I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection," said he. "Being myfriend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it."</p><p>The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma couldunderstand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found iteasier to meet her eye than her friend's. He was gone the nextmoment:--after another moment's pause,</p><p>"Take it," said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards Harriet--"it is for you. Take your own."</p><p>But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.</p><pre>       To Miss--<br /></pre><pre>         CHARADE.<br /></pre><pre>   My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,<br />     Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.<br />   Another view of man, my second brings,<br />     Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!<br /></pre><pre>   But ah! united, what reverse we have!<br />     Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;<br />   Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,<br />     And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br /></pre><pre>     Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,<br />     May its approval beam in that soft eye!<br /></pre><p>She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read itthrough again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, andthen passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hopeand dulness, "Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worsecharades. <i>Courtship</i>--a very good hint. I give you credit forit. This is feeling your way. This is saying very plainly--`Pray, MissSmith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade andmy intentions in the same glance.'</p><pre>     May its approval beam in that soft eye!<br /></pre><p>Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets, the justest that could be given.</p><pre>     Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.<br /></pre><p>Humph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very muchin love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you hadthe benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in yourlife you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellentcharade indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to acrisis soon now.</p><p>She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by theeagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.</p><p>"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not anidea--I cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do tryto find it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing sohard. Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be theyoung lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?</p><pre>     And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br /></pre><p>Can it be Neptune?</p><pre>     Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!<br /></pre><p>Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only onesyllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?"</p><p>"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are youthinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade madeby a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.</p><p>For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith.</p><pre>   My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,<br />     Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.<br /></pre><p>That is <i>court</i>.</p><pre>   Another view of man, my second brings;<br />     Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!<br /></pre><p>That is <i>ship</i>;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.</p><pre>   But ah! united, (<i>courtship</i>, you know,) what reverse we have!<br />     Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.<br />   Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,<br />     And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.<br /></pre><p>A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application, which Ithink, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty incomprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt ofits being written for you and to you."</p><p>Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She readthe concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could notspeak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.Emma spoke for her.</p><p>"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in thiscompliment," said she, "that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton'sintentions. You are his object--and you will soon receive thecompletest proof of it. I thought it must be so. I thought I could notbe so deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clearand decided, as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knewyou. Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the verycircumstance to happen what has happened. I could never tell whether anattachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or mostnatural. Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalledeach other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, withall my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pridein creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. It willgive you every thing that you want--consideration, independence, aproper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends,close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This,Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us."</p><p>"Dear Miss Woodhouse!"--and "Dear Miss Woodhouse," was all thatHarriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but whenthey did arrive at something more like conversation, it wassufficiently clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, andremembered just as she ought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very ampleacknowledgment.</p><p>"Whatever you say is always right," cried Harriet, "and therefore Isuppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could nothave imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about <i>him</i>.He is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--`To Miss--------.' Dear me, how clever!--Could it really be meant for me?"</p><p>"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It isa certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to theplay, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed bymatter-of-fact prose."</p><p>"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure,a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do takeplace!"</p><p>"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--andreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is soevidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement ofother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to oneanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marryingwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be asomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the rightdirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.</p><pre>     The course of true love never did run smooth--<br /></pre><p>A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage."</p><p>"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of allpeople, who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looksup to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, thatevery body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does notchuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week.And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts hehas ever preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I lookback to the first time I saw him! How little did I think!--The twoAbbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind whenwe heard he was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, andstaid to look through herself; however, she called me back presently,and let me look too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful wethought he looked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole."</p><p>"This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be,must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense;and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they areanxious to see you <i>happily</i> married, here is a man whose amiablecharacter gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have yousettled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to placeyou in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only object is thatyou should, in the common phrase, be <i>well</i> married, here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy them."</p><p>"Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. Youunderstand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as theother. This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could neverhave made any thing like it."</p><p>"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it yesterday."</p><p>"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read."</p><p>"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly."</p><p>"It is as long again as almost all we have had before."</p><p>"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things in general cannot be too short."</p><p>Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind.</p><p>"It is one thing," said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--"tohave very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and ifthere is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say justwhat you must, in a short way; and another, to write verses andcharades like this."</p><p>Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's prose.</p><p>"Such sweet lines!" continued Harriet--"these two last!--But howshall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found itout?--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?"</p><p>"Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, Idare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or otherwill pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyesshall chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me."</p><p>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write thisbeautiful charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half sogood."</p><p>"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book."</p><p>"Oh! but those two lines are"--</p><p>--"The best of all. Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for privateenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does itsmeaning change. But take it away, and all <i>appropriation</i> ceases,and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection.Depend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, muchbetter than his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in bothcapacities, or neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, andthen there can be no possible reflection on you."</p><p>Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down adeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degreeof publicity.</p><p>"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands," said she.</p><p>"Very well," replied Emma; "a most natural feeling; and the longerit lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming:you will not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be givinghim so much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especiallyany thing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit ofgallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him."</p><p>Harriet looked grave.</p><p>"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon thischarade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are tooconscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or evenquite all the meaning which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpoweredby such a little tribute of admiration. If he had been anxious forsecrecy, he would not have left the paper while I was by; but he ratherpushed it towards me than towards you. Do not let us be too solemn onthe business. He has encouragement enough to proceed, without oursighing out our souls over this charade."</p><p>"Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please."</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, bythe recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of "Well, my dears, howdoes your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?"</p><p>"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. Apiece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt, we suppose,by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copiedit in."</p><p>She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowlyand distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of everypart as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and, as she hadforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.</p><p>"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Verytrue. `Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, thatI can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written soprettily, but you, Emma."</p><p>Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very tender sigh, he added,</p><p>"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear motherwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I canremember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have heardme mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there areseveral.</p><pre>   Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,<br />     Kindled a flame I yet deplore,<br />   The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,<br />   Though of his near approach afraid,<br />     So fatal to my suit before.<br /></pre><p>And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very cleverall the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it."</p><p>"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know."</p><p>"Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.</p><pre>   Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.<br /></pre><p>The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very nearbeing christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall haveher here next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall puther--and what room there will be for the children?"</p><p>"Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she alwayshas;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual, youknow. Why should there be any change?"</p><p>"I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--notsince last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley'sbeing a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadlytaken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes, notto see Miss Taylor here!"</p><p>"She will not be surprized, papa, at least."</p><p>"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married."</p><p>"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is here."</p><p>"Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressedtone)--she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for anything."</p><p>"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a caseof necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, andwe ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of thetime they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to betaken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claimthis Christmas--though you know it is longer since they were with him,than with us."</p><p>"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield."</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on hisbrother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He satmusing a little while, and then said,</p><p>"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back sosoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her tostay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well."</p><p>"Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, andI do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind herhusband."</p><p>This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr.Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw hisspirits affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to herhusband, she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as mustraise them.</p><p>"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while mybrother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with thechildren. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonderwhich she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?"</p><p>"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they willbe to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet."</p><p>"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not."</p><p>"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is theeldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, thatthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which Ithought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. Theyare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They willcome and stand by my chair, and say, `Grandpapa, can you give me a bitof string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him kniveswere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough withthem very often."</p><p>"He appears rough to you," said Emma, "because you are so verygentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, youwould not think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy;and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but heis an affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley is anaffectionate father. The children are all fond of him."</p><p>"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way!"</p><p>"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It issuch enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the ruleof their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to theother."</p><p>"Well, I cannot understand it."</p><p>"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other."</p><p>Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separatein preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of thisinimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma couldreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned inhis the consciousness of having made a push--of having thrown a die;and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. Hisostensible reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's partycould be made up in the evening without him, or whether he should be inthe smallest degree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thingelse must give way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying somuch about his dining with him--had made such a point of it, that hehad promised him conditionally to come.</p><p>Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing hisfriend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. Here-urged--she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow,when taking the paper from the table, she returned it--</p><p>"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I haveventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will nottake it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the firsteight lines."</p><p>Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He lookedrather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about"honour,"--glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the bookopen on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. Withthe view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,</p><p>"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charademust not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman'sapprobation while he writes with such gallantry."</p><p>"I have no hesitation in saying," replied Mr. Elton, thoughhesitating a good deal while he spoke; "I have no hesitation insaying--at least if my friend feels at all as <i>I</i> do--I have not the smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as <i>I</i> see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life."</p><p>After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could notthink it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, therewas a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline herto laugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tenderand the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.</p></span><span id = 113 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather toprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on themorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, wholived a little way out of Highbury.</p><p>Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a laneleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main streetof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode ofMr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old andnot very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It hadno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by thepresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibilityof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observingeyes.--Emma's remark was--</p><p>"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these days."-- Harriet's was--</p><p>"Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much."</p><p>"I do not often walk this way <i>now</i>," said Emma, as they proceeded, "but <i>then</i>there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimatelyacquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this partof Highbury."</p><p>Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side theVicarage, and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, consideringexteriors and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof oflove, with Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.</p><p>"I wish we could contrive it," said she; "but I cannot think of anytolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquireabout of his housekeeper--no message from my father."</p><p>She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some minutes, Harriet thus began again--</p><p>"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going to be married! so charming as you are!"--</p><p>Emma laughed, and replied,</p><p>"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me tomarry; I must find other people charming--one other person at least.And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have verylittle intention of ever marrying at all."</p><p>"Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it."</p><p>"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to betempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of thequestion: and I do <i>not</i> wish to see any such person. I wouldrather not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I wereto marry, I must expect to repent it."</p><p>"Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!"--</p><p>"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I tofall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never havebeen in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I evershall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such asituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as muchmistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never,never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so alwaysfirst and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's."</p><p>"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!"</p><p>"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; andif I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--so smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious-- and soapt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marryto-morrow. But between <i>us</i>, I am convinced there never can be any likeness, except in being unmarried."</p><p>"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!"</p><p>"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it ispoverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! Asingle woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a singlewoman, of good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensibleand pleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so muchagainst the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sourthe temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a verysmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal andcross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only toogood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is verymuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Povertycertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she hadonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give awaysixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm."</p><p>"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you grow old?"</p><p>"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with agreat many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should bemore in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me thenas they are now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, Ishall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. Andas for objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is intruth the great point of inferiority, the want of which is really thegreat evil to be avoided in <i>not</i> marrying, I shall be very welloff, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about.There will be enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sortof sensation that declining life can need. There will be enough forevery hope and every fear; and though my attachment to none can equalthat of a parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what iswarmer and blinder. My nephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niecewith me."</p><p>"Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her a hundred times--but are you acquainted?"</p><p>"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury. By the bye, <i>that</i>is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece. Heaven forbid!at least, that I should ever bore people half so much about all theKnightleys together, as she does about Jane Fairfax. One is sick of thevery name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from her is read forty timesover; her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and ifshe does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pairof garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death."</p><p>They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics weresuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poorwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, hercounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romanticexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education haddone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, andalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. Inthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which shecame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could givecomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression ofthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,</p><p>"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling theymake every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think ofnothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, whocan say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?"</p><p>"Very true," said Harriet. "Poor creatures! one can think of nothing else."</p><p>"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over," saidEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which endedthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought theminto the lane again. "I do not think it will," stopping to look oncemore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the stillgreater within.</p><p>"Oh! dear, no," said her companion.</p><p>They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend waspassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emmatime only to say farther,</p><p>"Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability ingood thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that ifcompassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it hasdone all that is truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enoughto do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressingto ourselves."</p><p>Harriet could just answer, "Oh! dear, yes," before the gentlemanjoined them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, werethe first subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. Hisvisit he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley aboutwhat could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back toaccompany them.</p><p>"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this," thoughtEmma; "to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increaseof love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on thedeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else."</p><p>Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soonafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on oneside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she hadnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits ofdependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,they would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediatelystopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacingof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of thefootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she wouldfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the timeshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had thecomfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child fromthe cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, tofetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talkto and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or wouldhave been the most natural, had she been acting just then withoutdesign; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,without any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; andshe was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in aconversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking withanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might drawback a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obligedto join them.</p><p>Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interestingdetail; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that hewas only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's partyat his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stiltoncheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery, the beet-root,and all the dessert.</p><p>"This would soon have led to something better, of course," was herconsoling reflection; "any thing interests between those who love; andany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If Icould but have kept longer away!"</p><p>They now walked on together quietly, till within view of thevicarage pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harrietinto the house, made her again find something very much amiss about herboot, and fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the laceoff short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presentlyobliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to putherself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.</p><p>"Part of my lace is gone," said she, "and I do not know how I am tocontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but Ihope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave tostop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband orstring, or any thing just to keep my boot on."</p><p>Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothingcould exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into hishouse and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. Theroom they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and lookingforwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated;the door between them was open, and Emma passed into it with thehousekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner.She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fullyintended that Mr. Elton should close it. It was not closed, however, itstill remained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessantconversation, she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his ownsubject in the adjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothingbut herself. It could be protracted no longer. She was then obliged tobe finished, and make her appearance.</p><p>The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had amost favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory ofhaving schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come tothe point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had toldHarriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothingserious.</p><p>"Cautious, very cautious," thought Emma; "he advances inch by inch, and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure."</p><p>Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by heringenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had beenthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leadingthem forward to the great event.</p></span><span id = 114 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma'spower to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The comingof her sister's family was so very near at hand, that first inanticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her primeobject of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfieldit was not to be expected--she did not herself expect-- that any thingbeyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her tothe lovers. They might advance rapidly if they would, however; theymust advance somehow or other whether they would or no. She hardlywished to have more leisure for them. There are people, who the moreyou do for them, the less they will do for themselves.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usualabsent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usualinterest. Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage hadbeen divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidaysof this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and itwas therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way bytheir Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could notbe induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; andwho consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy inforestalling this too short visit.</p><p>He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not alittle of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bringsome of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms wereneedless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. andMrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number ofnursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy ofsuch an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, andvariously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusionwhich his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor haveendured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and thefeelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, thatin spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of herlittle ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty andattendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, thechildren were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either inthemselves or in any restless attendance on them.</p><p>Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and sotenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higherties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see afault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding orany quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inheritedalso much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health,over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves,and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could beof Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper,and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.</p><p>Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his privatecharacter; but with reserved manners which prevented his beinggenerally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. Hewas not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as todeserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection;and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible thatany natural defects in it should not be increased. The extremesweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness andquickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act anungracious, or say a severe thing.</p><p>He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothingwrong in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuriesto Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might havepassed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister,but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, withoutpraise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personalcompliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of allin her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectfulforbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patiencethat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities andfidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance orsharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr.John Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, andgenerally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too oftenfor Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain ofapprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. Thebeginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properestfeelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to passaway in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated andcomposed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and asigh, called his daughter's attention to the sad change at Hartfieldsince she had been there last.</p><p>"Ah, my dear," said he, "poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business."</p><p>"Oh yes, sir," cried she with ready sympathy, "how you must missher! And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!-- I havebeen so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly dowithout her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is prettywell, sir."</p><p>"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably."</p><p>Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls.</p><p>"Oh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in mylife-- never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret."</p><p>"Very much to the honour of both," was the handsome reply.</p><p>"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?" asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish."</p><p>"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since theymarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,either at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, mostfrequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Westonis really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholyway, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every bodymust be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body oughtalso to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent ourmissing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--whichis the exact truth."</p><p>"Just as it should be," said Mr. John Knightley, "and just as Ihoped it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention couldnot be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it alleasy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea ofthe change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; andnow you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied."</p><p>"Why, to be sure," said Mr. Woodhouse--"yes, certainly--I cannotdeny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us prettyoften-- but then--she is always obliged to go away again."</p><p>"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.-- You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."</p><p>"I think, indeed," said John Knightley pleasantly, "that Mr. Westonhas some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the partof the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, theclaims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As forIsabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience ofputting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can."</p><p>"Me, my love," cried his wife, hearing and understanding only inpart.-- "Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, orcan be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had notbeen for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never havethought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I thinkthere is nothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the verybest-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and yourbrother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget hisflying Henry's kite for him that very windy day last Easter--and eversince his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writingthat note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me thatthere was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there couldnot be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any bodycan deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor."</p><p>"Where is the young man?" said John Knightley. "Has he been here on this occasion--or has he not?"</p><p>"He has not been here yet," replied Emma. "There was a strongexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended innothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."</p><p>"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear," said her father."He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a veryproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it verywell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, onecannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--"</p><p>"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes."</p><p>"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thoughtit-- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well,time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, it was anexceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a greatdeal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and datedSept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on;and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'-- I remember thatperfectly."</p><p>"How very pleasing and proper of him!" cried the good-hearted Mrs.John Knightley. "I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man.But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from hisparents and natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston couldpart with him. To give up one's child! I really never could think wellof any body who proposed such a thing to any body else."</p><p>"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy," observedMr. John Knightley coolly. "But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to havefelt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston israther an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehowor other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called societyfor his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, andplaying whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon familyaffection, or any thing that home affords."</p><p>Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, andhad half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. Shewould keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourableand valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of hometo himself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down onthe common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it wasimportant.--It had a high claim to forbearance.</p></span><span id = 115 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclinationof Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with himin Isabella's first day. Emma's sense of right however had decided it;and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she hadparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreementbetween Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the properinvitation.</p><p>She hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time to make up. Making-up indeed would not do. <i>She</i> certainly had not been in the wrong, and <i>he</i>would never own that he had. Concession must be out of the question;but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled; andshe hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship, thatwhen he came into the room she had one of the children with her--theyoungest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who was now makingher first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced about in heraunt's arms. It did assist; for though he began with grave looks andshort questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usualway, and to take the child out of her arms with all theunceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again;and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then alittle sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring thebaby,</p><p>"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews andnieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree."</p><p>"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men andwomen, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealingswith them, as you are where these children are concerned, we mightalways think alike."</p><p>"To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong."</p><p>"Yes," said he, smiling--"and reason good. I was sixteen years old when you were born."</p><p>"A material difference then," she replied--"and no doubt you weremuch my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does notthe lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good dealnearer?"</p><p>"Yes--a good deal <i>nearer</i>."</p><p>"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we think differently."</p><p>"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, andby not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dearEmma, let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt,little Emma, that she ought to set you a better example than to berenewing old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she isnow."</p><p>"That's true," she cried--"very true. Little Emma, grow up a betterwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as goodintentions went, we were <i>both</i> right, and I must say that noeffects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only wantto know that Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed."</p><p>"A man cannot be more so," was his short, full answer.</p><p>"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me."</p><p>This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when JohnKnightley made his appearance, and "How d'ye do, George?" and "John,how are you?" succeeded in the true English style, burying under acalmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment whichwould have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for thegood of the other.</p><p>The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declinedcards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella,and the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and hisdaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totallydistinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally joining inone or the other.</p><p>The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, butprincipally of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the mostcommunicative, and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate,he had generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand thehome-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear nextyear, and to give all such local information as could not fail of beinginteresting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longestpart of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of adrain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and thedestination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, wasentered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his coolermanners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him anything to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone ofeagerness.</p><p>While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse wasenjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with hisdaughter.</p><p>"My poor dear Isabella," said he, fondly taking her hand, andinterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of herfive children--"How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You andI will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose weall have a little gruel."</p><p>Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that boththe Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article asherself;--and two basins only were ordered. After a little morediscourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not beingtaken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air ofgrave reflection,</p><p>"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn atSouth End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the seaair."</p><p>"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we shouldnot have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularlyfor the weakness in little Bella's throat,-- both sea air and bathing."</p><p>"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her anygood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, thoughperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of useto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once."</p><p>"Come, come," cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, "Imust beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious andmiserable;-- I who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if youplease. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry aboutMr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you."</p><p>"Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?"</p><p>"Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and hehas not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has not time totake care of himself--which is very sad--but he is always wanted allround the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practiceanywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where."</p><p>"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the childrengrow? I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be callingsoon. He will be so pleased to see my little ones."</p><p>"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two toask him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever hecomes, you had better let him look at little Bella's throat."</p><p>"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardlyany uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatestservice to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellentembrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been applying at timesever since August."</p><p>"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been ofuse to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I wouldhave spoken to--</p><p>"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates," said Emma, "I have not heard one inquiry after them."</p><p>"Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you mentionthem in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.Bates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.--They arealways so pleased to see my children.-- And that excellent MissBates!--such thorough worthy people!-- How are they, sir?"</p><p>"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago."</p><p>"How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have beenthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them moregeneral or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza."</p><p>"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degreeyou mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not soheavy as he has very often known them in November. Perry does not callit altogether a sickly season."</p><p>"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it <i>very</i> sickly except--</p><p>"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always asickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is adreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!-- and theair so bad!"</p><p>"No, indeed--<i>we</i> are not at all in a bad air. Our part ofLondon is very superior to most others!--You must not confound us withLondon in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Squareis very different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! Ishould be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my childrenin: but <i>we</i> are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air."</p><p>"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it--but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of youdifferent creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say,that I think you are any of you looking well at present."</p><p>"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, exceptingthose little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am neverentirely free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if thechildren were rather pale before they went to bed, it was only becausethey were a little more tired than usual, from their journey and thehappiness of coming. I hope you will think better of their looksto-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did notbelieve he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust,at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill," turning hereyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.</p><p>"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well."</p><p>"What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?" cried Mr. John Knightley, hearing his own name.</p><p>"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think youlooking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. Icould have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr.Wingfield before you left home."</p><p>"My dear Isabella,"--exclaimed he hastily--"pray do not concernyourself about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddlingyourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse."</p><p>"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling yourbrother," cried Emma, "about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to havea bailiff from Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will itanswer? Will not the old prejudice be too strong?"</p><p>And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, whenforced to give her attention again to her father and sister, she hadnothing worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax;and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, shewas at that moment very happy to assist in praising.</p><p>"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!" said Mrs. John Knightley.-- "Itis so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a momentaccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good oldgrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I alwaysregret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more atHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.Campbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such adelightful companion for Emma."</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,</p><p>"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such anotherpretty kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not havea better companion than Harriet."</p><p>"I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age."</p><p>This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded ofsimilar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the eveningdid not close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came andsupplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, andpretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never metwith tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which thedaughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore mostprominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman hired forthe time, who never had been able to understand what she meant by abasin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she hadwished for and ordered it, she had never been able to get any thingtolerable. Here was a dangerous opening.</p><p>"Ah!" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes onher with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, "Ah!there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. Itdoes not bear talking of." And for a little while she hoped he wouldnot talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restorehim to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of someminutes, however, he began with,</p><p>"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn, instead of coming here."</p><p>"But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children a great deal of good."</p><p>"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not havebeen to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprizedto hear you had fixed upon South End."</p><p>"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it isquite a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there,never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfieldsays it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I amsure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature ofthe air, and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly."</p><p>"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of allthe sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air.And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite awayfrom the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You shouldhave consulted Perry."</p><p>"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider howgreat it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty."</p><p>"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing elseshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much tochuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into aworse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a veryill-judged measure."</p><p>Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he hadreached such a point as this, she could not wonder at herbrother-in-law's breaking out.</p><p>"Mr. Perry," said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, "woulddo as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he makeit any business of his, to wonder at what I do?-- at my taking myfamily to one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope,the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.-- I want his directions nomore than his drugs." He paused-- and growing cooler in a moment,added, with only sarcastic dryness, "If Mr. Perry can tell me how toconvey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirtymiles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance offorty, I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he couldhimself."</p><p>"True, true," cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--"very true. That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I wastelling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning itmore to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows, Icannot conceive any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were tobe the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you callto mind exactly the present line of the path. . . . The only way ofproving it, however, will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you atthe Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we will look them over,and you shall give me your opinion."</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on hisfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, beenattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but thesoothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the presentevil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and betterrecollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.</p></span><span id = 116 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. JohnKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morningamong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking overwhat she had done every evening with her father and sister. She hadnothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly.It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.</p><p>In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than theirmornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take nodenial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse waspersuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division ofthe party.</p><p>How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty ifhe could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses wereactually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simplequestion on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupyEmma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages findroom for Harriet also.</p><p>Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, werethe only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, aswell as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination beingconsulted in every thing.</p><p>The evening before this great event (for it was a very great eventthat Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had beenspent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposedwith a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emmacalled on her the next day, and found her doom already signed withregard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat:Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of,and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority whichexcluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could notspeak of her loss without many tears.</p><p>Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs.Goddard's unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representinghow much Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; andleft her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of hishaving a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her verymuch. She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, whenshe was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and asthey walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid-- ofwhom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going toinquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield-- theywere overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit toDonwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewedall the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatchof the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for. Theyjoined company and proceeded together. Emma was just describing thenature of her friend's complaint;-- "a throat very much inflamed, witha great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &amp;c. and she wassorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very badsore-throats, and had often alarmed her with them." Mr. Elton lookedall alarm on the occasion, as he exclaimed,</p><p>"A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putridinfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care ofyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.Why does not Perry see her?"</p><p>Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillisedthis excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experienceand care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness whichshe could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed andassist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject,</p><p>"It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much likesnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, Ishould really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father fromventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feelthe cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be sogreat a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to mea little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice andwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more thancommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night."</p><p>Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer tomake; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by thekind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice ofher's, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and viewsto hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very wellsatisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being "very cold,certainly very cold," and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated himfrom Randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire afterHarriet every hour of the evening.</p><p>"You do quite right," said she;--"we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston."</p><p>But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civillyoffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's onlyobjection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much promptsatisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never hadhis broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than whenhe next looked at her.</p><p>"Well," said she to herself, "this is most strange!--After I had gothim off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet illbehind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men,especially single men, such an inclination-- such a passion for diningout--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thinggives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a mostvaluable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much inlove with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he mustdine out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can seeready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her."</p><p>Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do himthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in hismanner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice whileassuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her fairfriend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meetingher again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and hesighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance ofapprobation much in his favour.</p><p>After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began with--</p><p>"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable thanMr. Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies toplease, every feature works."</p><p>"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect," replied Emma; "but wherethere is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlooka great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, hewill have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is suchperfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value."</p><p>"Yes," said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, "he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you."</p><p>"Me!" she replied with a smile of astonishment, "are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton's object?"</p><p>"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it neveroccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now."</p><p>"Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!"</p><p>"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether itis so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think yourmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had betterlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do."</p><p>"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton andI are very good friends, and nothing more;" and she walked on, amusingherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from apartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people ofhigh pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not verywell pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, andin want of counsel. He said no more.</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, thatin spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea ofshrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with hiseldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousnessof the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of hisown going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that itwas cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, wassevere; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakesof snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance ofbeing so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a verywhite world in a very short time.</p><p>Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. Thepreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice ofhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipatednothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and thewhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing hisdiscontent.</p><p>"A man," said he, "must have a very good opinion of himself when heasks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day asthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a mostagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatestabsurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!-- The folly of not allowingpeople to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people's not stayingcomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such anevening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship weshould deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothingthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance ofthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his viewor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelterthat he can;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours inanother man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not saidand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses andfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shiveringcreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have hadat home."</p><p>Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which nodoubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the "Very true, mylove," which must have been usually administered by his travellingcompanion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making anyanswer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded beingquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him totalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without openingher lips.</p><p>They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr.Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emmathought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was allobligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilitiesindeed, that she began to think he must have received a differentaccount of Harriet from what had reached her. She had sent whiledressing, and the answer had been, "Much the same-- not better."</p><p>"<i>My</i> report from Mrs. Goddard's," said she presently, "was not so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better' was <i>my</i> answer."</p><p>His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered.</p><p>"Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling youthat when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very lastthing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was notbetter, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved andconcerned-- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such acordial as I knew had been given her in the morning."</p><p>Emma smiled and answered--"My visit was of use to the nervous partof her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as youprobably heard."</p><p>"Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--"</p><p>"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrowmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it isimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!"</p><p>"Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment."</p><p>This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was reallyestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismaywhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.</p><p>"What an excellent device," said he, "the use of a sheepskin forcarriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel coldwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed haverendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fencedand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its wayunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a verycold afternoon--but in this carriage we know nothing of thematter.--Ha! snows a little I see."</p><p>"Yes," said John Knightley, "and I think we shall have a good deal of it."</p><p>"Christmas weather," observed Mr. Elton. "Quite seasonable; andextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not beginyesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possiblyhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there beenmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quitethe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every bodyinvites their friends about them, and people think little of even theworst weather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week.Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could notget away till that very day se'nnight."</p><p>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly,</p><p>"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls."</p><p>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too muchastonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harrietseemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.</p><p>"We are sure of excellent fires," continued he, "and every thing inthe greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;-- Mrs.Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values,so hospitable, and so fond of society;-- it will be a small party, butwhere small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable ofany. Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than tencomfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me,(turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have yourapprobation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the largeparties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings."</p><p>"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine with any body."</p><p>"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the lawhad been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when youwill be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and greatenjoyment."</p><p>"My first enjoyment," replied John Knightley, as they passed throughthe sweep-gate, "will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again."</p></span><span id = 117 ><p>Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as theywalked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose hisjoyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Eltonmust smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for theplace.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just ashappy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in theworld to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not anyone, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to andunderstood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, thelittle affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her fatherand herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Westonhad not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterruptedcommunication of all those little matters on which the daily happinessof private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.</p><p>This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might notafford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; butthe very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice wasgrateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible ofMr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy allthat was enjoyable to the utmost.</p><p>The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone throughbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough togive the history of it, besides all the history of his own andIsabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed justgot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see hisdaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had beenalmost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn awayand welcome her dear Emma.</p><p>Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rathersorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was closeto her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibilitytowards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, butwas continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, andsolicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgettinghim, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internalsuggestion of "Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it bepossible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections fromHarriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!"-- Yet he would be so anxiousfor her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father,and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring herdrawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terriblylike a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve hergood manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and forHarriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was evenpositively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something wasgoing on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.Elton's nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heardenough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about hisson; she heard the words "my son," and "Frank," and "my son," repeatedseveral times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very muchsuspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; butbefore she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely pastthat any reviving question from her would have been awkward.</p><p>Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of nevermarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. FrankChurchill, which always interested her. She had frequentlythought--especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--thatif she <i>were</i> to marry, he was the very person to suit her inage, character and condition. He seemed by this connexion between thefamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be amatch that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though notmeaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up asituation which she believed more replete with good than any she couldchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decidedintention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certaindegree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled intheir friends' imaginations.</p><p>With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfullyill-timed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, whilefeeling very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit couldnot possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So itproved;-- for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr.Weston, at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the caresof hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, tosay to her,</p><p>"We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like tosee two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and myson--and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you didnot hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we areexpecting Frank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will bewith us within a fortnight."</p><p>Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assentedto his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making theirparty quite complete.</p><p>"He has been wanting to come to us," continued Mr. Weston, "eversince September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannotcommand his own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, andwho (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good manysacrifices. But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the secondweek in January."</p><p>"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is soanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy asyourself."</p><p>"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be anotherput-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but shedoes not know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is--(butthis is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it inthe other room. There are secrets in all families, you know)--The caseis, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe inJanuary; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. Ifthey are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because itis a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, hasa particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invitethem once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comesto the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am asconfident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am ofbeing here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards theupper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been solittle used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on theireffects, as I have been long in the practice of doing."</p><p>"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,"replied Emma; "but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If youthink he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe."</p><p>"Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never beenat the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allowmyself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe her tobe very fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fondof any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (inher way--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting everything to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, tohim, that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would notsay it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to peoplein general; and the devil of a temper."</p><p>Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs.Weston, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing herjoy-- yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be ratheralarming.-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should bevery glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting atthe time talked of: "for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot beso sanguine as Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all endin nothing. Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly howthe matter stands?"</p><p>"Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world."</p><p>"My Emma!" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "what is the certainty ofcaprice?" Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attendingbefore--"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no meansso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his fatherthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; inshort, upon her temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture onthe truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-temperedwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him."</p><p>"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill," repliedIsabella: "and I am sure I never think of that poor young man withoutthe greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-temperedperson, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known anything of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that shenever had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she wouldhave made them!"</p><p>Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should thenhave heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree ofunreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she reallybelieved, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to theChurchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of whichher own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.But at present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse verysoon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long afterdinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine norconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those withwhom he was always comfortable.</p><p>While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of saying,</p><p>"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any meanscertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better."</p><p>"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraidthat some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear toimagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wishon the Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. Theyare jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel nodependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine."</p><p>"He ought to come," said Emma. "If he could stay only a couple ofdays, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's nothaving it in his power to do as much as that. A young <i>woman</i>, ifshe fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance fromthose she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young <i>man'</i>s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he likes it."</p><p>"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,before one decides upon what he can do," replied Mrs. Weston. "Oneought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct ofany one individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe,certainly must not be judged by general rules: <i>she</i> is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her."</p><p>"But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, towhom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant capricetowards <i>him</i>, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all."</p><p>"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, tounderstand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it goits own way. I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerableinfluence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to knowbeforehand <i>when</i> it will be."</p><p>Emma listened, and then coolly said, "I shall not be satisfied, unless he comes."</p><p>"He may have a great deal of influence on some points," continuedMrs. Weston, "and on others, very little: and among those, on which sheis beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this verycircumstance of his coming away from them to visit us."</p></span><span id = 131 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" />Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his teahe was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his threecompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness ofthe hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chattyand convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but atlast the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, invery good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston andEmma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.</p><p>Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind bythe expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his lateimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on hismaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with mostfriendly smiles.</p><p>He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend-- herfair, lovely, amiable friend. "Did she know?--had she heard any thingabout her, since their being at Randalls?-- he felt much anxiety--hemust confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed himconsiderably." And in this style he talked on for some time veryproperly, not much attending to any answer, but altogether sufficientlyawake to the terror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charitywith him.</p><p>But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once asif he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account,than on Harriet's--more anxious that she should escape the infection,than that there should be no infection in the complaint. He began withgreat earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting thesick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat her to <i>promise</i> <i>him</i>not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnthis opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subjectback into its proper course, there was no putting an end to his extremesolicitude about her. She was vexed. It did appear--there was noconcealing it--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her,instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible andabominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turnedto Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance, "Would not she give him hersupport?--would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce MissWoodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that MissSmith's disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without apromise-- would not she give him her influence in procuring it?"</p><p>"So scrupulous for others," he continued, "and yet so careless forherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, andyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sorethroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us. Have notI some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid."</p><p>Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, atan address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself theright of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too muchprovoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing tothe purpose. She could only give him a look; but it was such a look asshe thought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa,removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.</p><p>She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidlydid another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into theroom from examining the weather, and opened on them all with theinformation of the ground being covered with snow, and of its stillsnowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these wordsto Mr. Woodhouse:</p><p>"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their waythrough a storm of snow."</p><p>Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every bodyelse had something to say; every body was either surprized or notsurprized, and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs.Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attentionfrom his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.</p><p>"I admired your resolution very much, sir," said he, "in venturingout in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow verysoon. Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired yourspirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour ortwo's snow can hardly make the road impassable; and we are twocarriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common fieldthere will be the other at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe atHartfield before midnight."</p><p>Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that hehad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest itshould make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for hishurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likelyto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraidthey would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmostgood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from theconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.</p><p>"What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?" was Mr.Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, herrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and oftheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.</p><p>His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror ofbeing blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, wasfull in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passablefor adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she waseager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain atRandalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through allthe possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.</p><p>"You had better order the carriage directly, my love," said she; "Idare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and ifwe do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not atall afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change myshoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thingthat gives me cold."</p><p>"Indeed!" replied he. "Then, my dear Isabella, it is the mostextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thingdoes give you cold. Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home,I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses."</p><p>Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma couldnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who hadleft the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow,came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors toexamine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficultyin their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hourhence. He had gone beyond the sweep-- some way along the Highburyroad--the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep--in many placeshardly enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling atpresent, but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance ofits being soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreedwith him in there being nothing to apprehend.</p><p>To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and theywere scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who wasimmediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervousconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not beappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued atRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger inreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safeto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus--</p><p>"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?"</p><p>"I am ready, if the others are."</p><p>"Shall I ring the bell?"</p><p>"Yes, do."</p><p>And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutesmore, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in hisown house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper andhappiness when this visit of hardship were over.</p><p>The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object onsuch occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley andMr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent somerenewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen,and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for."He was afraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poorIsabella would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in thecarriage behind. He did not know what they had best do. They must keepas much together as they could;" and James was talked to, and given acharge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.</p><p>Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting thathe did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife verynaturally; so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into thesecond carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut onthem, and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It would not havebeen the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked tohim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed butone. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he hadbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that hewould want to be talking nonsense.</p><p>To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she wasimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity ofthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely hadthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than shefound her subject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded, andMr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of theprecious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already wellknown, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him; butflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love andunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. Itreally was so. Without scruple--without apology-- without much apparentdiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself <i>her</i>lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say itall. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve torestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly mustbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only tothe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and theplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, shereplied,</p><p>"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to <i>me</i>! you forgetyourself-- you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shallbe happy to deliver; but no more of this to <i>me</i>, if you please."</p><p>"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possiblymean!"-- And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, suchboastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying withquickness,</p><p>"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I canaccount for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could notspeak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourselfenough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it."</p><p>But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, notat all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning;and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious,and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned atall,--he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgentfor a favourable answer.</p><p>As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of hisinconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,replied,</p><p>"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourselftoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I canexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the lastmonth, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daily habitof observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is anunsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the objectof such professions."</p><p>"Good Heaven!" cried Mr. Elton, "what can be the meaning of this?--Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of myexistence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: nevercared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she hasfancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am verysorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse!who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon myhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only ofyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any oneelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, hasbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannotreally, seriously, doubt it. No!--(in an accent meant to beinsinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me."</p><p>It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was toocompletely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two momentsof silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state ofmind, he tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed--</p><p>"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence. It confesses that you have long understood me."</p><p>"No, sir," cried Emma, "it confesses no such thing. So far fromhaving long understood you, I have been in a most complete error withrespect to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorrythat you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could befarther from my wishes--your attachment to my friend Harriet--yourpursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and Ihave been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed thatshe were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly havethought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I tobelieve that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularlyto Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her?"</p><p>"Never, madam," cried he, affronted in his turn: "never, I assure you. <i>I</i>think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl;and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish herextremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not objectto--Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equalalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No, madam, myvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragementI received--"</p><p>"Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have beenentirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirerof my friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than acommon acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that themistake ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, MissSmith might have been led into a misconception of your views; not beingaware, probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequalitywhich you are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment issingle, and, I trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts ofmatrimony at present."</p><p>He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided toinvite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, andmutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a fewminutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to afoot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have beendesperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no roomfor the little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when thecarriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they foundthemselves, all at once, at the door of his house; and he was outbefore another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable towish him a good night. The compliment was just returned, coldly andproudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits, she was thenconveyed to Hartfield.</p><p>There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, whohad been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from VicarageLane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of-- and instrange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it seemed asif her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness andattention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of herfather, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin ofgruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and theday was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation; andit needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful tillthe usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.</p></span><span id = 176 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down tothink and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such anoverthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a developmentof every thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was theworst of all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of somesort or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light;and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken-- more inerror--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could theeffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.</p><p>"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could haveborne any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me-- but poorHarriet!"</p><p>How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had neverthought seriously of Harriet--never! She looked back as well as shecould; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, shesupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, musthave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been somisled.</p><p>The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!-- and thecharade!--and an hundred other circumstances;-- how clearly they hadseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its "readywit"--but then the "soft eyes"-- in fact it suited neither; it was ajumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through suchthick-headed nonsense?</p><p>Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners toherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mereerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among othersthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all thegentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,till this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to meanany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.</p><p>To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on thesubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denyingthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightleyhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, theconviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marryindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of hischaracter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It wasdreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in manyrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and littleconcerned about the feelings of others.</p><p>Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to payhis addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions andhis proposals did him no service. She thought nothing of hisattachment, and was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, andhaving the arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love;but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointmentthat need be cared for. There had been no real affection either in hislanguage or manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance;but she could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any toneof voice, less allied with real love. She need not trouble herself topity him. He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if MissWoodhouse of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were notquite so easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for MissSomebody else with twenty, or with ten.</p><p>But--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her asaware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), tomarry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion ormind!--look down upon her friend, so well understanding the gradationsof rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancyhimself shewing no presumption in addressing her!-- It was mostprovoking.</p><p>Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he washer inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very wantof such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must knowthat in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He mustknow that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations atHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family--and that theEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly wasinconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, fromother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to DonwellAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouseshad long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhoodwhich Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way ashe could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommendhim to notice but his situation and his civility.-- But he had fanciedher in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; andafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle mannersand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop andadmit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant andobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her realmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation anddelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.If <i>she</i> had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder that <i>he</i>, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers.</p><p>The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, itwas wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two peopletogether. It was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making lightof what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. Shewas quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.</p><p>"Here have I," said she, "actually talked poor Harriet into beingvery much attached to this man. She might never have thought of him butfor me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if Ihad not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humbleas I used to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuadingher not to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was welldone of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to timeand chance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her theopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to haveattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.I have been but half a friend to her; and if she were <i>not</i> tofeel this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea ofany body else who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe--Oh!no, I could not endure William Coxe-- a pert young lawyer."</p><p>She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed amore serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and mightbe, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make toHarriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with theawkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing ordiscontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealingresentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in mostunmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at lastwith nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered mostdreadfully.</p><p>To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though undertemporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bringreturn of spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happyanalogy, and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignantenough to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open tosensations of softened pain and brighter hope.</p><p>Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she hadgone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, andto depend on getting tolerably out of it.</p><p>It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really inlove with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking todisappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that superiorsort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive-- and thatthere could be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passedexcept the three principals, and especially for her father's beinggiven a moment's uneasiness about it.</p><p>These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal ofsnow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcomethat might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.</p><p>The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, shecould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had hisdaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either excitingor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground coveredwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost andthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, everymorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in tofreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. Nointercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her onSunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses forMr. Elton's absenting himself.</p><p>It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; andthough she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in somesociety or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so wellsatisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stirout; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keepentirely from them,--</p><p>"Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?"</p><p>These days of confinement would have been, but for her privateperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suitedher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to hiscompanions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off hisill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him duringthe rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable andobliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopesof cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was stillsuch an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet,as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.</p></span><span id = 179 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. Theweather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to staybehind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party setoff, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poorIsabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doatedon, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocentlybusy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.</p><p>The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note fromMr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say,with Mr. Elton's best compliments, "that he was proposing to leaveHighbury the following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliancewith the pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend afew weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, fromvarious circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personalleave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should everretain a grateful sense-- and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should behappy to attend to them."</p><p>Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just at thistime was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contrivingit, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which itwas announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken thanin a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.She had not even a share in his opening compliments.--Her name was notmentioned;-- and there was so striking a change in all this, and suchan ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his gracefulacknowledgments, as she thought, at first, could not escape herfather's suspicion.</p><p>It did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize ofso sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never getsafely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language.It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter forthought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr.Woodhouse talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuadethem away with all her usual promptitude.</p><p>She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She hadreason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it wasdesirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting thebetter of her other complaint before the gentleman's return. She wentto Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo thenecessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.-- She hadto destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriouslyfeeding--to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred--and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all herideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions, allher prophecies for the last six weeks.</p><p>The confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight ofHarriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity withherself again.</p><p>Harriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody-- and inevery thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowlyopinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at thatmoment to her friend.</p><p>Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to theutmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching,seemed on Harriet's side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herselfas having any thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr.Elton would have been too great a distinction.-- She never could havedeserved him--and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as MissWoodhouse would have thought it possible.</p><p>Her tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless, thatno dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes-- and shelistened to her and tried to console her with all her heart andunderstanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was thesuperior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would be morefor her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligencecould do.</p><p>It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-mindedand ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmedof being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the restof her life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims,was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her ownaffection in some better method than by match-making. She got her toHartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving tooccupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Eltonfrom her thoughts.</p><p>Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; andshe could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters ingeneral, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr.Elton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet'sage, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress mightbe made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return,as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine ofacquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasingthem.</p><p>Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained thenon-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did,in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen;but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive againstan inclination of that sort <i>unrequited</i>, that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.</p><p>If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evidentand indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she couldnot imagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight orthe recollection of him.</p><p>Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was badfor each, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, orof effecting any material change of society. They must encounter eachother, and make the best of it.</p><p>Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions atMrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers andgreat girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that shecould have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderationor repellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the curebe found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the wayof cure, there could be no true peace for herself.</p></span><span id = 181 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near,Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter ofexcuse. For the present, he could not be spared, to his "very greatmortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope ofcoming to Randalls at no distant period."</p><p>Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, infact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young manhad been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for everexpecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes byany proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized andsorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or threemonths later would be a much better plan; better time of year; betterweather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stayconsiderably longer with them than if he had come sooner.</p><p>These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of amore apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition ofexcuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband wasto suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.</p><p>Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really aboutMr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment atRandalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted,rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it wasdesirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, shetook care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter aswarmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturallybelong to their friendship.</p><p>She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimedquite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhapsrather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away.She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of theadvantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; thepleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire,which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections onthe Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreementwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she wastaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and makinguse of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.</p><p>"The Churchills are very likely in fault," said Mr. Knightley, coolly; "but I dare say he might come if he would."</p><p>"I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him."</p><p>"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made apoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof."</p><p>"How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature?"</p><p>"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspectingthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care verylittle for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those whohave always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more naturalthan one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who areproud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfishtoo. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would havecontrived it between September and January. A man at his age--what ishe?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing asmuch as that. It is impossible."</p><p>"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always beenyour own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley,of the difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to havetempers to manage."</p><p>"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twentyshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot wantmoney--he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has somuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest hauntsin the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place orother. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he canleave the Churchills."</p><p>"Yes, sometimes he can."</p><p>"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."</p><p>"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without anintimate knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in theinterior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individualof that family may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, andwith Mrs. Churchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what hernephew can do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more thanhe can at others."</p><p>"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses,and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigourand resolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention tohis father. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but ifhe wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would sayat once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill-- `Every sacrifice ofmere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to yourconvenience; but I must go and see my father immediately. I know hewould be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on thepresent occasion. I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'-- If he wouldsay so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, therewould be no opposition made to his going."</p><p>"No," said Emma, laughing; "but perhaps there might be some made tohis coming back again. Such language for a young man entirelydependent, to use!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine itpossible. But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situationsdirectly opposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such aspeech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and areto provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose,and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conductpracticable?"</p><p>"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty init. He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made, ofcourse, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner-- would dohim more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with thepeople he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedientscan ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel thatthey could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by hisfather, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, aswell as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to hisfather; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in theirhearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act inthis sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, theirlittle minds would bend to his."</p><p>"I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; butwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think theyhave a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable asgreat ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, wereto be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill'ssituation, you would be able to say and do just what you have beenrecommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. TheChurchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you wouldhave no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once intoperfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude andregard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,as you can have, without being so equal, under particularcircumstances, to act up to it."</p><p>"Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction."</p><p>"Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try tounderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directlyopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all hislife."</p><p>"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be thefirst occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right againstthe will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by thistime, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I canallow for the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he becamerational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that wasunworthy in their authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempton their side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought,there would have been no difficulty now."</p><p>"We shall never agree about him," cried Emma; "but that is nothingextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man'sperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from someadvantages, it will secure him many others."</p><p>"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, andof leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremelyexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fineflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuadehimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world ofpreserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any rightto complain. His letters disgust me."</p><p>"Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else."</p><p>"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfya woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother'splace, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on heraccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doublyfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, hewould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether hedid or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort ofconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this toherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only inFrench, not in English. He may be very `aimable,' have very goodmanners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacytowards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about him."</p><p>"You seem determined to think ill of him."</p><p>"Me!--not at all," replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; "I donot want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge hismerits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merelypersonal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,plausible manners."</p><p>"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be atreasure at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men,well-bred and agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all thevirtues into the bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a <i>sensation</i>his coming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout theparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest-- one object ofcuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speakof nobody else."</p><p>"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find himconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only achattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts."</p><p>"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the tasteof every body, and has the power as well as the wish of beinguniversally agreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, ofdrawing or music; and so on to every body, having that generalinformation on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead,or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak extremelywell on each; that is my idea of him."</p><p>"And mine," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "is, that if he turn out anything like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man-- thepractised politician, who is to read every body's character, and makeevery body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; tobe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear likefools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense couldnot endure such a puppy when it came to the point."</p><p>"I will say no more about him," cried Emma, "you turn every thing toevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have nochance of agreeing till he is really here."</p><p>"Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced."</p><p>"But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My lovefor Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour."</p><p>"He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,"said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emmaimmediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend whyhe should be angry.</p><p>To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be ofa different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberalityof mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with allthe high opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge,she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust tothe merit of another.</p></span><span id = 183 ></span><span id = 186 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, inEmma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. Shecould not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more;and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as theyreturned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter,and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive-- "Mr. Elton is sogood to the poor!" she found something else must be done.</p><p>They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and MissBates. She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and MissBates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by thevery few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rathernegligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought tothe stock of their scanty comforts.</p><p>She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her ownheart, as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract thepersuasion of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresomewomen-- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with thesecond-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them forever, and therefore she seldom went near them. But now she made thesudden resolution of not passing their door without goingin--observing, as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as shecould calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter fromJane Fairfax.</p><p>The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Batesoccupied the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sizedapartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were mostcordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, whowith her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even togive up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talkingdaughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanksfor their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries afterMr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her mother's, andsweet-cake from the beaufet--"Mrs. Cole had just been there, justcalled in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour withthem, and <i>she</i> had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as tosay she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouseand Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too."</p><p>The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr.Elton. There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr.Elton since his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must havethe letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and howmuch he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever hewent, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and shewent through it very well, with all the interest and all thecommendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward toprevent Harriet's being obliged to say a word.</p><p>This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; butmeant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no fartherincommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst allthe Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She hadnot been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he wasactually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at lastabruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.</p><p>"Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing-- Mrs.Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- Mrs. Colewas so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soonas she came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great afavourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know howto shew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it asmuch as any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly,saying, `I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it isnot her time for writing;' and when I immediately said, `But indeed wehave, we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever sawany body more surprized. `Have you, upon your honour?' said she; `well,that is quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.'"</p><p>Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--</p><p>"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I hope she is well?"</p><p>"Thank you. You are so kind!" replied the happily deceived aunt,while eagerly hunting for the letter.--"Oh! here it is. I was sure itcould not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my handso very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I wasreading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading itagain to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her-- a letter fromJane--that she can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could notbe far off, and here it is, only just under my huswife--and since youare so kind as to wish to hear what she says;--but, first of all, Ireally must, in justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short aletter--only two pages you see-- hardly two--and in general she fillsthe whole paper and crosses half. My mother often wonders that I canmake it out so well. She often says, when the letter is first opened,`Well, Hetty, now I think you will be put to it to make out all thatchecker-work'-- don't you, ma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure shewould contrive to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it forher-- every word of it--I am sure she would pore over it till she hadmade out every word. And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are not sogood as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God! withthe help of spectacles. It is such a blessing! My mother's are reallyvery good indeed. Jane often says, when she is here, `I am sure,grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do--and somuch fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last meas well.'"</p><p>All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop forbreath; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of MissFairfax's handwriting.</p><p>"You are extremely kind," replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; "youwho are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am surethere is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as MissWoodhouse's. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know.Ma'am," addressing her, "do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obligingto say about Jane's handwriting?"</p><p>And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly complimentrepeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. Shewas pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seemingvery rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and hadalmost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse,when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.</p><p>"My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all.By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is veryremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama atall deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal atmy mother's time of life--and it really is full two years, you know,since she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before,and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enoughof her now."</p><p>"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?"</p><p>"Oh yes; next week."</p><p>"Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure."</p><p>"Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is sosurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure shewill be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to seeher. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because ColonelCampbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. Sovery good of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, youknow. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about.That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, inthe common course, we should not have heard from her before nextTuesday or Wednesday."</p><p>"Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day."</p><p>"So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had notbeen for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here sosoon. My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with usat least. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to havethe pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that theCampbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father andmother to come over and see her directly. They had not intended to goover till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again--fortill she married, last October, she was never away from them so much asa week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, Iwas going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote avery urgent letter to her mother--or her father, I declare I do notknow which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrotein Mr. Dixon's name as well as her own, to press their coming overdirectly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take themback to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean-- Ido not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it wasvery natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own placewhile he was paying his addresses--and as Jane used to be very oftenwalking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were veryparticular about their daughter's not walking out often with only Mr.Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard everything he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland;and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings ofthe place, views that he had taken himself. He is a most amiable,charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland,from his account of things."</p><p>At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma'sbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the notgoing to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of fartherdiscovery,</p><p>"You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowedto come to you at such a time. Considering the very particularfriendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expectedher to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."</p><p>"Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have alwaysbeen rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at sucha distance from us, for months together--not able to come if any thingwas to happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. Theywant her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel andMrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind orpressing than their <i>joint</i> invitation, Jane says, as you willhear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in anyattention. He is a most charming young man. Ever since the service herendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were out in that party on thewater, and she, by the sudden whirling round of something or otheramong the sails, would have been dashed into the sea at once, andactually was all but gone, if he had not, with the greatest presence ofmind, caught hold of her habit-- (I can never think of it withouttrembling!)--But ever since we had the history of that day, I have beenso fond of Mr. Dixon!"</p><p>"But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish ofseeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs.Bates?"</p><p>"Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Coloneland Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they shouldrecommend; and indeed they particularly <i>wish</i> her to try her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately."</p><p>"I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has noremarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to becompared with Miss Fairfax."</p><p>"Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things--but certainlynot. There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always wasabsolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable."</p><p>"Yes, that of course."</p><p>"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th ofNovember, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been wellsince. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She nevermentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! soconsiderate!--But however, she is so far from well, that her kindfriends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an airthat always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or fourmonths at Highbury will entirely cure her-- and it is certainly a greatdeal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she isunwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do."</p><p>"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world."</p><p>"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and theCampbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following-- asyou will find from Jane's letter. So sudden!--You may guess, dear MissWoodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for thedrawback of her illness--but I am afraid we must expect to see hergrown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unluckything happened to me, as to that. I always make a point of readingJane's letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to mymother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distressher. Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-daywith my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of herbeing unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poorJane is ill!'-- which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly,and was sadly alarmed at. However, when I read on, I found it was notnear so bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now toher, that she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how Icould be so off my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will callin Mr. Perry. The expense shall not be thought of; and though he is soliberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean tocharge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, youknow. He has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be givingaway his time. Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Janewrites about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells herown story a great deal better than I can tell it for her."</p><p>"I am afraid we must be running away," said Emma, glancing atHarriet, and beginning to rise--"My father will be expecting us. I hadno intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than fiveminutes, when I first entered the house. I merely called, because Iwould not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I havebeen so pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs.Bates good morning."</p><p>And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. Sheregained the street--happy in this, that though much had been forced onher against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substanceof Jane Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.</p></span><span id = 189 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest daughter.</p><p>The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ______________ regiment ofinfantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure,hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholyremembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking underconsumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.</p><p>By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, onlosing her mother, she became the property, the charge, theconsolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemedevery probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her beingtaught only what very limited means could command, and growing up withno advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on whatnature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, andwarm-hearted, well-meaning relations.</p><p>But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave achange to her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highlyregarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man;and farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during asevere camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claimswhich he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away fromthe death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put anything in his power. When he did return, he sought out the child andtook notice of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, agirl, about Jane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them longvisits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine yearsold, his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being areal friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell ofundertaking the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; andfrom that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, andhad lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from timeto time.</p><p>The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; thevery few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father makingindependence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out ofColonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay andappointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be allhis daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to besupplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.</p><p>Such was Jane Fairfax's history. She had fallen into good hands,known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given anexcellent education. Living constantly with right-minded andwell-informed people, her heart and understanding had received everyadvantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residencebeing in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, bythe attendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilitieswere equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen ornineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for thecare of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself;but she was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father normother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evilday was put off. It was easy to decide that she was still too young;and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all therational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture ofhome and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the soberingsuggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all thismight soon be over.</p><p>The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of MissCampbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from thecircumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty andacquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseenby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt bythe parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, tillthe marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which sooften defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction towhat is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged theaffections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost assoon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled,while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.</p><p>This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing tobe yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on herpath of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgmenthad fixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twentyshould be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, shehad resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retirefrom all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society,peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.</p><p>The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such aresolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, noexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; andfor their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but thiswould be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon.Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to haveresisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste ofsuch enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still,however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for nothurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well sincethe time of their daughter's marriage; and till she should havecompletely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engagingin duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frameand varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to bedischarged with tolerable comfort.</p><p>With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account toher aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truthsnot told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence toHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty withthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, thatthey depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for therecovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that shewas to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfectnovelty which had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--mustput up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only thefreshness of a two years' absence.</p><p>Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did notlike through three long months!--to be always doing more than shewished, and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfaxmight be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once toldher it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman,which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation hadbeen eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments ofself-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her.But "she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how itwas, but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparentindifference whether she pleased or not--and then, her aunt was such aneternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--andit had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate--becausetheir ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fondof each other." These were her reasons-- she had no better.</p><p>It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was somagnified by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first timeafter any considerable absence, without feeling that she had injuredher; and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a twoyears' interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearanceand manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herselfthe highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such asalmost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemedto point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel allthis; and then, her face--her features-- there was more beauty in themaltogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was verypleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes andeyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which shehad been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness anddelicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty,of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, inhonour, by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether ofperson or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to bevulgar, was distinction, and merit.</p><p>In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfaxwith twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense ofrendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike her nolonger. When she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well asher beauty; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to,what she was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemedimpossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, ifto every well-known particular entitling her to interest, were addedthe highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, whichshe had so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could bemore pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolvedon. Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr.Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which herimagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it might besimple, single, successless love on her side alone. She might have beenunconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of hisconversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving todivide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soonbeginning her career of laborious duty.</p><p>Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitablefeelings, as made her look around in walking home, and lament thatHighbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.</p><p>These were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she hadcommitted herself by any public profession of eternal friendship forJane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices anderrors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, "She certainly is handsome; sheis better than handsome!" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield withher grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into itsusual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresomeas ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added toadmiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description ofexactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and howsmall a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions ofnew caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane'soffences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and thethanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her anaffectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew offin higher style her own very superior performance. She was, besides,which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no gettingat her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemeddetermined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciouslyreserved.</p><p>If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was morereserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. Sheseemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, orher own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of thematch. It was all general approbation and smoothness; nothingdelineated or distinguished. It did her no service however. Her cautionwas thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her firstsurmises. There probably <i>was</i> something more to conceal than herown preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing onefriend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sakeof the future twelve thousand pounds.</p><p>The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. FrankChurchill had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that theywere a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information couldEmma procure as to what he truly was. "Was he handsome?"--"She believedhe was reckoned a very fine young man." "Was he agreeable?"-- "He wasgenerally thought so." "Did he appear a sensible young man; a young manof information?"--"At a watering-place, or in a common Londonacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners wereall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge thanthey had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found hismanners pleasing." Emma could not forgive her.</p></span><span id = 191 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation norresentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party,and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side,he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again onbusiness with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not soopenly as he might have done had her father been out of the room, butspeaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma. He had been usedto think her unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking animprovement.</p><p>"A very pleasant evening," he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse hadbeen talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and thepapers swept away;--"particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gaveus some very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir,than sitting at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by twosuch young women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation.I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. Youleft nothing undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for havingno instrument at her grandmother's, it must have been a realindulgence."</p><p>"I am happy you approved," said Emma, smiling; "but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."</p><p>"No, my dear," said her father instantly; "<i>that</i> I am sure youare not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If anything, you are too attentive. The muffin last night--if it had beenhanded round once, I think it would have been enough."</p><p>"No," said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; "you are notoften deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension.I think you understand me, therefore."</p><p>An arch look expressed--"I understand you well enough;" but she said only, "Miss Fairfax is reserved."</p><p>"I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome allthat part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has itsfoundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured."</p><p>"You think her diffident. I do not see it."</p><p>"My dear Emma," said he, moving from his chair into one close byher, "you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasantevening."</p><p>"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused to think how little information I obtained."</p><p>"I am disappointed," was his only answer.</p><p>"I hope every body had a pleasant evening," said Mr. Woodhouse, inhis quiet way. "I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but thenI moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturbme. Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is,though she speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, andMrs. Bates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss JaneFairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a verywell-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the eveningagreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma."</p><p>"True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax."</p><p>Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for thepresent, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--</p><p>"She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyesfrom. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from myheart."</p><p>Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared toexpress; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whosethoughts were on the Bates's, said--</p><p>"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined!a great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little onecan venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin ora leg; it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is not like anyother pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma, unless one couldbe sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours arefried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomachcan bear roast pork--I think we had better send the leg-- do not youthink so, my dear?"</p><p>"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wishit. There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so verynice, and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like."</p><p>"That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before,but that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, ifit is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just asSerle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip,and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome."</p><p>"Emma," said Mr. Knightley presently, "I have a piece of news foryou. You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that Ithink will interest you."</p><p>"News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?--why do you smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?"</p><p>He had time only to say,</p><p>"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls," when the doorwas thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room.Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to givequickest. Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and thatnot another syllable of communication could rest with him.</p><p>"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse--I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! Youare too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to bemarried."</p><p>Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was socompletely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and alittle blush, at the sound.</p><p>"There is my <a class="&quot;external" title="&quot;news:--I&quot;" rel="&quot;nofollow&quot;">news:--I</a>thought it would interest you," said Mr. Knightley, with a smile whichimplied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them.</p><p>"But where could <i>you</i> hear it?" cried Miss Bates. "Where couldyou possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since Ireceived Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five-- or atleast ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to comeout--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Janewas standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?-- for my mother was soafraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I wouldgo down and see, and Jane said, `Shall I go down instead? for I thinkyou have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--`Oh!my dear,' said I--well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins--that's all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, howcould you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole toldMrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins--"</p><p>"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had justread Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly."</p><p>"Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news moregenerally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. Mymother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousandthanks, and says you really quite oppress her."</p><p>"We consider our Hartfield pork," replied Mr. Woodhouse--"indeed itcertainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and Icannot have a greater pleasure than--"</p><p>"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too goodto us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealththemselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. Wemay well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.' Well, Mr.Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--"</p><p>"It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, ofcourse."-- Here was a sly glance at Emma. "He had been so fortunate asto-- I forget the precise words--one has no business to remember them.The information was, as you state, that he was going to be married to aMiss Hawkins. By his style, I should imagine it just settled."</p><p>"Mr. Elton going to be married!" said Emma, as soon as she could speak. "He will have every body's wishes for his happiness."</p><p>"He is very young to settle," was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. "Hehad better not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was.We were always glad to see him at Hartfield."</p><p>"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!" said Miss Bates,joyfully; "my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot bear to havethe poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed.Jane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such acuriosity to see him."</p><p>Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her.</p><p>"No--I have never seen Mr. Elton," she replied, starting on this appeal; "is he--is he a tall man?"</p><p>"Who shall answer that question?" cried Emma. "My father would say`yes,' Mr. Knightley `no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just thehappy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection inHighbury, both in person and mind."</p><p>"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best youngman--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he wasprecisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,--I dare say, anexcellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother-- wanting herto sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for mymother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she does nothear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. Hefancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath-- but she says itdid him no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite ourangel. And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy ofhim. It is such a happiness when good people get together--and theyalways do. Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there arethe Coles, such very good people; and the Perrys--I suppose there neverwas a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,"turning to Mr. Woodhouse, "I think there are few places with suchsociety as Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in ourneighbours.--My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves betterthan another, it is pork-- a roast loin of pork--"</p><p>"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has beenacquainted with her," said Emma, "nothing I suppose can be known. Onefeels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone onlyfour weeks."</p><p>Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings, Emma said,</p><p>"You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take aninterest in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much oflate on these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business onMiss Campbell's account--we shall not excuse your being indifferentabout Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins."</p><p>"When I have seen Mr. Elton," replied Jane, "I dare say I shall be interested--but I believe it requires <i>that</i> with me. And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn off."</p><p>"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, MissWoodhouse," said Miss Bates, "four weeks yesterday.--A MissHawkins!--Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young ladyhereabouts; not that I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but Iimmediately said, `No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man--but'--Inshort, I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort ofdiscoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At thesame time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired--MissWoodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would notoffend for the world. How does Miss Smith do? She seems quite recoverednow. Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately? Oh! those dearlittle children. Jane, do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr.John Knightley. I mean in person--tall, and with that sort of look--andnot very talkative."</p><p>"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all."</p><p>"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any bodybeforehand. One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon,you say, is not, strictly speaking, handsome?"</p><p>"Handsome! Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain. I told you he was plain."</p><p>"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain, and that you yourself--"</p><p>"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard,I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed thegeneral opinion, when I called him plain."</p><p>"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weatherdoes not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging,my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been amost agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs.Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had bettergo home directly--I would not have you out in a shower!--We think sheis the better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shallnot attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think shecares for any thing but <i>boiled</i> pork: when we dress the leg itwill be another thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr.Knightley is coming too. Well, that is so very!--I am sure if Jane istired, you will be so kind as to give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, andMiss Hawkins!--Good morning to you."</p><p>Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by himwhile he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--and to marry strangers too--and the other half she could give to herown view of the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a verywelcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not havesuffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it--andall that she could hope was, by giving the first information herself,to save her from hearing it abruptly from others. It was now about thetime that she was likely to call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in herway!--and upon its beginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect thatthe weather would be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that theintelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.</p><p>The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over fiveminutes, when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated lookwhich hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!" which instantlyburst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As theblow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindnessthan in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what shehad to tell. "She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago--shehad been afraid it would rain--she had been afraid it would pour downevery moment--but she thought she might get to Hartfield first--she hadhurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by thehouse where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought shewould just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seemto stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as shecould, and took shelter at Ford's."--Ford's was the principalwoollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shopfirst in size and fashion in the place.--"And so, there she had set,without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes,perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in-- to be sure it wasso very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's-- who should come in, butElizabeth Martin and her brother!-- Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. Ithought I should have fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sittingnear the door--Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busywith the umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly,and took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of theshop; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!I am sure I must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away youknow, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in theworld but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last, I fancy, helooked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, theybegan whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; andI could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak tome--(do you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she cameforward--came quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed readyto shake hands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the same waythat she used; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to<i>try</i> to be very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talkingsome time; but I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--Iremember she said she was sorry we never met now; which I thoughtalmost too kind! Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! Bythat time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined thatnothing should stop me from getting away--and then--only think!-- Ifound he was coming up towards me too--slowly you know, and as if hedid not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke, and Ianswered--and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully, you know, onecan't tell how; and then I took courage, and said it did not rain, andI must go; and so off I set; and I had not got three yards from thedoor, when he came after me, only to say, if I was going to Hartfield,he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's stables, for Ishould find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh! dear, Ithought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was very muchobliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he went back toElizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I believe I did--but Ihardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, Iwould rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly andso kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me andmake me comfortable again."</p><p>Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately inher power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughlycomfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemedthe result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harrietdescribed it, there had been an interesting mixture of woundedaffection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believedthem to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference didthis make in the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbedby it. Of course, he must be sorry to lose her--they must be all sorry.Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might allhave hoped to rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was thevalue of Harriet's description?--So easily pleased--so littlediscerning;-- what signified her praise?</p><p>She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, byconsidering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy ofbeing dwelt on,</p><p>"It might be distressing, for the moment," said she; "but you seemto have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never-- cannever, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need notthink about it."</p><p>Harriet said, "very true," and she "would not think about it;" butstill she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma,at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged tohurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tendercaution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamedor only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such aconclusion of Mr. Elton's importance with her!</p><p>Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did notfeel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before, oran hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their firstconversation was over, she had talked herself into all the sensationsof curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to thisfortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the Martins underproper subordination in her fancy.</p><p>Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting.It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retainingany influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not getat her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either thecourage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of thebrother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; and atwelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, withany necessity, or even any power of speech.</p></span><span id = 193 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are ininteresting situations, that a young person, who either marries ordies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.</p><p>A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentionedin Highbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to haveevery recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant,highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himselfarrived to triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame ofher merits, there was very little more for him to do, than to tell herChristian name, and say whose music she principally played.</p><p>Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected andmortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of whatappeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the rightlady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. Hehad gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged to another--and toanother as superior, of course, to the first, as under suchcircumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came backgay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for MissWoodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.</p><p>The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usualadvantages of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of anindependent fortune, of so many thousands as would always be calledten; a point of some dignity, as well as some convenience: the storytold well; he had not thrown himself away--he had gained a woman of10,000 l. or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightfulrapidity-- the first hour of introduction had been so very soonfollowed by distinguishing notice; the history which he had to giveMrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious--thesteps so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr.Green's, and the party at Mrs. Brown's--smiles and blushes rising inimportance-- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered--thelady had been so easily impressed--so sweetly disposed--had in short,to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him, thatvanity and prudence were equally contented.</p><p>He had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection,and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself andhis own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be laughedat--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the youngladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been morecautiously gallant.</p><p>The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselvesto please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; andwhen he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, whicha certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that whenhe next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.</p><p>During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but justenough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her theimpression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique andpretension, now spread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning verymuch to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and hissight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeablefeelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, asource of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have beenthankful to be assured of never seeing him again. She wished him verywell; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off wouldadminister most satisfaction.</p><p>The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, mustcertainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would beprevented-- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A <i>Mrs.</i> <i>Elton</i>would be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy mightsink without remark. It would be almost beginning their life ofcivility again.</p><p>Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was goodenough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--handsome enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As toconnexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all hisown vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On thatarticle, truth seemed attainable. <i>What</i> she was, must be uncertain; but <i>who</i>she was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it didnot appear that she was at all Harriet's superior. She brought no name,no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the twodaughters of a Bristol-- merchant, of course, he must be called; but,as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so verymoderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of tradehad been very moderate also. Part of every winter she had been used tospend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; forthough the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncleremained-- in the law line--nothing more distinctly honourable washazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him thedaughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney,and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the connexion seemeddependent on the elder sister, who was <i>very</i> <i>well</i> <i>married</i>, to a gentleman in a <i>great</i> <i>way</i>, near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins.</p><p>Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She hadtalked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked outof it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet'smind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; hecertainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martinwould have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cureher. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be alwaysin love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from thisreappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of himsomewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three timesevery day Harriet was sure <i>just</i> to meet with him, or <i>just</i> to miss him, <i>just</i> to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, <i>just</i>to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all thefavouring warmth of surprize and conjecture. She was, moreover,perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting when at Hartfield, shewas always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothingso interesting as the discussion of his concerns; and every report,therefore, every guess--all that had already occurred, all that mightoccur in the arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income,servants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Herregard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and herregrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions ofMiss Hawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much heseemed attached!-- his air as he walked by the house--the very sittingof his hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!</p><p>Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to herfriend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind,Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Eltonpredominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally usefulas a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure ofthe agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by theknowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by ElizabethMartin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet hadnot been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her,written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with agreat deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she hadbeen much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be donein return, and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr.Elton, in person, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, theMartins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off forBath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.</p><p>How that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary-- andwhat might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, wouldbe ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of theacquaintance!--</p><p>After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, thanHarriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they hadunderstanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formalacquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at theAbbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again sosoon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerousrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degreeof intimacy was chosen for the future.</p><p>She could think of nothing better: and though there was something init which her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude,merely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?</p></span><span id = 195 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before herfriend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led her tothe very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to <i>The</i> <i>Rev.</i> <i>Philip</i> <i>Elton</i>, <i>White-Hart</i>, <i>Bath</i>,was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher'scart, which was to convey it to where the coaches past; and every thingin this world, excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequentlya blank.</p><p>She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to beput down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led betweenespalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing whichhad given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning torevive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observedher to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, whichdetermined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter ofan hour. She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an oldservant who was married, and settled in Donwell.</p><p>The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gateagain; and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her withoutdelay, and unattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarilydown the gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, andparting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility.</p><p>Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She wasfeeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough tounderstand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received herdoubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplacehad been talked almost all the time-- till just at last, when Mrs.Martin's saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith wasgrown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner.In that very room she had been measured last September, with her twofriends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscotby the window. <i>He</i> had done it. They all seemed to remember theday, the hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness,the same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding;and they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emmamust suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,)when the carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit,and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteenminutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed sixweeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feelhow justly they might resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It wasa bad business. She would have given a great deal, or endured a greatdeal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life. They were sodeserving, that a <i>little</i> higher should have been enough: but asit was, how could she have done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could notrepent. They must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain inthe process-- so much to herself at this time, that she soon felt thenecessity of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way ofRandalls to procure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and theMartins. The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.</p><p>It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard thatneither "master nor mistress was at home;" they had both been out sometime; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.</p><p>"This is too bad," cried Emma, as they turned away. "And now weshall just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been sodisappointed." And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge hermurmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both-- such beingthe commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently thecarriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, whowere standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sightof them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr.Weston immediately accosted her with,</p><p>"How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--glad to see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter thismorning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty-- he is atOxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would beso. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; Iwas always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to havejust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shallenjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we couldwish."</p><p>There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding theinfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all wasby the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, butnot less to the purpose. To know that <i>she</i> thought his comingcertain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did sherejoice in their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhaustedspirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what wascoming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr.Elton would now be talked of no more.</p><p>Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at hiscommand, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and shelistened, and smiled, and congratulated.</p><p>"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield," said he, at the conclusion.</p><p>Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his wife.</p><p>"We had better move on, Mr. Weston," said she, "we are detaining the girls."</p><p>"Well, well, I am ready;"--and turning again to Emma, "but you must not be expecting such a <i>very</i> fine young man; you have only had <i>my</i>account you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:"--though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a verydifferent conviction.</p><p>Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing.</p><p>"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock," was Mrs.Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant onlyfor her.</p><p>"Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three," was Mr.Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore adifferent air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish asbefore. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at leastmust soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she sawsomething like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.</p><p>"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?"-- was a question, however, which did not augur much.</p><p>But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, andEmma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.</p><p>The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston'sfaithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelveo'clock, that she was to think of her at four.</p><p>"My dear, dear anxious friend,"--said she, in mental soliloquy,while walking downstairs from her own room, "always overcareful forevery body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your littlefidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure that all isright." The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. "'Tistwelve; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and bythis time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking ofthe possibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bringhim soon."</p><p>She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with herfather--Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a fewminutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation ofFrank's being a day before his time, and her father was yet in themidst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared,to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.</p><p>The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, wasactually before her--he was presented to her, and she did not think toomuch had been said in his praise; he was a <i>very</i> good lookingyoung man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and hiscountenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of hisfather's; he looked quick and sensible. She felt immediately that sheshould like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and areadiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to beacquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.</p><p>He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with theeagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travelearlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.</p><p>"I told you yesterday," cried Mr. Weston with exultation, "I toldyou all that he would be here before the time named. I remembered whatI used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot helpgetting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming inupon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great dealmore than any little exertion it needs."</p><p>"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it," said the youngman, "though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;but in coming <i>home</i> I felt I might do any thing."</p><p>The word <i>home</i> made his father look on him with freshcomplacency. Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himselfagreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed. He wasvery much pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arrangedhouse, would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired thesituation, the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more,and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in thecountry which none but one's <i>own</i> country gives, and thegreatest curiosity to visit it. That he should never have been able toindulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously through Emma'sbrain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, andpleasantly handled. His manner had no air of study or exaggeration. Hedid really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment.</p><p>Their subjects in general were such as belong to an openingacquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,--"Was she ahorsewoman?--Pleasant rides?-- Pleasant walks?--Had they a largeneighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There wereseveral very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls--had theyballs?--Was it a musical society?"</p><p>But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintanceproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, whiletheir two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing hismother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, somuch warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she securedto his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was anadditional proof of his knowing how to please-- and of his certainlythinking it worth while to try to please her. He did not advance a wordof praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs.Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. Heunderstood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. "Hisfather's marriage," he said, "had been the wisest measure, every friendmust rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such ablessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highestobligation on him."</p><p>He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things itwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse'scharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as ifresolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to itsobject, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty ofher person.</p><p>"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for," said he; "but Iconfess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than avery tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know thatI was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston."</p><p>"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings," said Emma; "were you to guess her to be <i>eighteen</i>, I should listen with pleasure; but <i>she</i>would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words. Don't let herimagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman."</p><p>"I hope I should know better," he replied; "no, depend upon it,(with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I shouldunderstand whom I might praise without any danger of being thoughtextravagant in my terms."</p><p>Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expectedfrom their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of hermind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to beconsidered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She mustsee more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt theywere agreeable.</p><p>She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. Hisquick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with ahappy expression; and even, when he might have determined not to look,she was confident that he was often listening.</p><p>Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, theentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther fromapproving matrimony than from foreseeing it.-- Though always objectingto every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand fromthe apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill ofany two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry tillit were proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. Hecould now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, withouta glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way toall his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evilsof sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixedanxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold--which,however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself tillafter another night.</p><p>A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--"He must begoing. He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great manyerrands for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any bodyelse." His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,saying,</p><p>"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take theopportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other,and therefore may as well be paid now. I have the honour of beingacquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a ladyresiding in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shallhave no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, Ibelieve, is not the proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates.Do you know any family of that name?"</p><p>"To be sure we do," cried his father; "Mrs. Bates--we passed herhouse-- I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquaintedwith Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girlshe is. Call upon her, by all means."</p><p>"There is no necessity for my calling this morning," said the youngman; "another day would do as well; but there was that degree ofacquaintance at Weymouth which--"</p><p>"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be donecannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;any want of attention to her <i>here</i> should be carefully avoided.You saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every bodyshe mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who hasbarely enough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight."</p><p>The son looked convinced.</p><p>"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance," said Emma; "she is a very elegant young woman."</p><p>He agreed to it, but with so quiet a "Yes," as inclined her almostto doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinctsort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could bethought only ordinarily gifted with it.</p><p>"If you were never particularly struck by her manners before," saidshe, "I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see herand hear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she hasan aunt who never holds her tongue."</p><p>"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?" said Mr.Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; "then giveme leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable younglady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, veryworthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremelyglad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you toshew you the way."</p><p>"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me."</p><p>"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great manyhouses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where youhad best cross the street."</p><p>Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as hecould, and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, "My goodfriend, this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water whenhe sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown ina hop, step, and jump."</p><p>They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one,and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emmaremained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, andcould now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day,with full confidence in their comfort.</p></span><span id = 196 ><p>The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came withMrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially.He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse theirwalk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--"He did not doubt there beingvery pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he shouldalways chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-lookingHighbury, would be his constant attraction."-- Highbury, with Mrs.Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the sameconstruction with him. They walked thither directly.</p><p>Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in forhalf a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knewnothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm inarm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him incompany with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of himwas to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amendsfor it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. Itwas not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paidhis duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his wholemanner to her--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish ofconsidering her as a friend and securing her affection. And there wastime enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visitincluded all the rest of the morning. They were all three walking abouttogether for an hour or two-- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield,and afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admiredHartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their goingfarther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted withthe whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest muchoftener than Emma could have supposed.</p><p>Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. Hebegged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, andwhich had been the home of his father's father; and on recollectingthat an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in questof her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though insome points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, theyshewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which mustbe very like a merit to those he was with.</p><p>Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn,it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarilyabsenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making aparade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly hadnot done him justice.</p><p>Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house,though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair ofpost-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhoodthan from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected tobe detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they gavethe history of the large room visibly added; it had been built manyyears ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in aparticularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used assuch;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now thehighest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whistclub established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.He was immediately interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him;and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the twosuperior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate itscapabilities, and lament that its original purpose should have ceased.He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge none which theysuggested. No, it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. Itwould hold the very number for comfort. They ought to have balls thereat least every fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouserevived the former good old days of the room?--She who could do anything in Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and theconviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs couldbe tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. Hecould not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he sawaround him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; andeven when particulars were given and families described, he was stillunwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would beany thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in everybody's returning into their proper place the next morning. He arguedlike a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rathersurprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedlyagainst the habits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the lifeand spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father,and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed,there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion ofrank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge,however, of the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion oflively spirits.</p><p>At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; andbeing now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emmarecollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he hadpaid it.</p><p>"Yes, oh! yes"--he replied; "I was just going to mention it. A verysuccessful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very muchobliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had takenme quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, Iwas only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minuteswould have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper;and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him--butthere was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, Ifound, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, thatI had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of anhour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before."</p><p>"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?"</p><p>"Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to lookill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally sopale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.-- A mostdeplorable want of complexion."</p><p>Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of MissFairfax's complexion. "It was certainly never brilliant, but she wouldnot allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softnessand delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the characterof her face." He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that hehad heard many people say the same--but yet he must confess, that tohim nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health.Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to themall; and where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need notattempt to describe what the effect was.</p><p>"Well," said Emma, "there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion."</p><p>He shook his head and laughed.--"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion."</p><p>"Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?"</p><p>At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastilyexclaimed, "Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attendsevery day of their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highburyhimself, he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business atFord's. If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I mayprove myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury.I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.-- Idare say they sell gloves."</p><p>"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. Youwill be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came,because you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at Ford's,and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues."</p><p>They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of "Men'sBeavers" and "York Tan" were bringing down and displaying on thecounter, he said--"But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you werespeaking to me, you were saying something at the very moment of thisburst of my <i>amor</i> <i>patriae</i>. Do not let me lose it. Iassure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amendsfor the loss of any happiness in private life."</p><p>"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth."</p><p>"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to bea very unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on thedegree of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given heraccount.-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she maychuse to allow."</p><p>"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. Buther account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so veryreserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about anybody, that I really think you may say what you like of youracquaintance with her."</p><p>"May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits meso well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells alittle in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,warm-hearted woman. I like them all."</p><p>"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she is destined to be?"</p><p>"Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do."</p><p>"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma," said Mrs. Weston smiling;"remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to saywhen you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move alittle farther off."</p><p>"I certainly do forget to think of <i>her</i>," said Emma, "as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend."</p><p>He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.</p><p>When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again,"Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?" saidFrank Churchill.</p><p>"Ever hear her!" repeated Emma. "You forget how much she belongs toHighbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.She plays charmingly."</p><p>"You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who couldreally judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, withconsiderable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.-- I amexcessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right ofjudging of any body's performance.--I have been used to hear her'sadmired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--aman, a very musical man, and in love with another woman--engaged toher--on the point of marriage-- would yet never ask that other woman tosit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit downinstead--never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof."</p><p>"Proof indeed!" said Emma, highly amused.--"Mr. Dixon is verymusical, is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour,from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year."</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof."</p><p>"Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger than, if <i>I</i>had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable to me. I couldnot excuse a man's having more music than love--more ear than eye--amore acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings. How did MissCampbell appear to like it?"</p><p>"It was her very particular friend, you know."</p><p>"Poor comfort!" said Emma, laughing. "One would rather have astranger preferred than one's very particular friend--with a strangerit might not recur again--but the misery of having a very particularfriend always at hand, to do every thing better than one doesoneself!-- Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle inIreland."</p><p>"You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she really did not seem to feel it."</p><p>"So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. Butbe it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship, ordulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have feltit: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerousdistinction."</p><p>"As to that--I do not--"</p><p>"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax'ssensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no humanbeing, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever shewas asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses."</p><p>"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among themall--" he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, "however,it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were-- how itmight all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there wassmoothness outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from achild, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she islikely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be."</p><p>"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been childrenand women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should beintimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visitedher friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; alittle, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone totake disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she alwayswas, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, herreserve--I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved."</p><p>"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed," said he. "Oftentimes veryconvenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person."</p><p>"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then theattraction may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend,or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble ofconquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between MissFairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to thinkill of her--not the least--except that such extreme and perpetualcautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct ideaabout any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being somethingto conceal."</p><p>He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long,and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted withhim, that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the worldin some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, thereforebetter than she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate-- hisfeelings warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner ofconsidering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he wouldgo and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. No,he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was tobe pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved,he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. Theremust be ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be ablockhead who wanted more.</p><p>Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talkingabout. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinkinghow many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, hecould be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a smallone. But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he <i>did</i> knowwhat he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiableinclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasionedby no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he didperfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and thatwhenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth tobe allowed an early establishment.</p></span><span id = 198 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken thefollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely tohave his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him atbreakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending toreturn to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared thanhaving his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his travellingsixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air offoppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did notaccord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or eventhe unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself todiscern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change,restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he becameliable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, andthought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, wasclear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and makingno other comment than that "all young people would have their littlewhims."</p><p>With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visithitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston wasvery ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he madehimself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. Heappeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful andlively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a greatdeal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fondof talking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if hewere left to himself; and though there was no being attached to theaunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to meanalways to speak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and,but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there wasnothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which herimagination had given him; the honour, if not of being really in lovewith her, of being at least very near it, and saved only by her ownindifference-- (for still her resolution held of never marrying)--thehonour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their jointacquaintance.</p><p>Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which musthave some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired herextremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with somuch to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge himharshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, "all young people would have theirlittle whims."</p><p>There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not soleniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishesof Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances weremade for the little excesses of such a handsome young man-- one whosmiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among themnot to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr.Knightley. The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment,he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say tohimself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, "Hum! just the trifling,silly fellow I took him for." She had half a mind to resent; but aninstant's observation convinced her that it was really said only torelieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore shelet it pass.</p><p>Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. andMrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularlyopportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to makeEmma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wantedexactly the advice they gave.</p><p>This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years inHighbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, andunpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, intrade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into thecountry, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keepinglittle company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or twohad brought them a considerable increase of means-- the house in townhad yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.With their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house,their inclination for more company. They added to their house, to theirnumber of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this timewere, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family atHartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room, preparedevery body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chieflyamong the single men, had already taken place. The regular and bestfamilies Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt <i>her</i>to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father's known habitswould be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coleswere very respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that itwas not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior familieswould visit them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receiveonly from herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr.Weston.</p><p>But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so manyweeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it foundher very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received theirinvitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.Weston's accounting for it with "I suppose they will not take theliberty with you; they know you do not dine out," was not quitesufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power ofrefusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembledthere, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her,occurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have beentempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and theBateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury theday before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented herabsence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question ofhis. The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on herspirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing theomission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.</p><p>It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were atHartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though herfirst remark, on reading it, was that "of course it must be declined,"she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.</p><p>She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutelywithout inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves soproperly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it-- somuch consideration for her father. "They would have solicited thehonour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screenfrom London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draughtof air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them thehonour of his company." Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; andit being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done withoutneglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates,might be depended on for bearing him company-- Mr. Woodhouse was to betalked into an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on aday now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. Asfor <i>his</i> going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, thehours would be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon prettywell resigned.</p><p>"I am not fond of dinner-visiting," said he--"I never was. No moreis Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Coleshould have done it. I think it would be much better if they would comein one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take us intheir afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are soreasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of theevening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose anybody to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dinewith them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, totake care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather bewhat it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy." Then turning to Mrs.Weston, with a look of gentle reproach--"Ah! Miss Taylor, if you hadnot married, you would have staid at home with me."</p><p>"Well, sir," cried Mr. Weston, "as I took Miss Taylor away, it isincumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.Goddard in a moment, if you wish it."</p><p>But the idea of any thing to be done in a <i>moment</i>, wasincreasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knewbetter how to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thingdeliberately arranged.</p><p>With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough fortalking as usual. "He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had agreat regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and inviteher. James could take the note. But first of all, there must be ananswer written to Mrs. Cole."</p><p>"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You willsay that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore mustdecline their obliging invitation; beginning with my <i>compliments</i>,of course. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you whatis to be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriagewill be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. Wehave never been there above once since the new approach was made; butstill I have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And whenyou get there, you must tell him at what time you would have him comefor you again; and you had better name an early hour. You will not likestaying late. You will get very tired when tea is over."</p><p>"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?"</p><p>"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise."</p><p>"But, my dear sir," cried Mr. Weston, "if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party."</p><p>"And no great harm if it does," said Mr. Woodhouse. "The sooner every party breaks up, the better."</p><p>"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma'sgoing away directly after tea might be giving offence. They aregood-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but stillthey must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment;and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any otherperson's in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify theColes, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, andwho have been your neighbours these <i>ten</i> years."</p><p>"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged toyou for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them anypain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Colenever touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, buthe is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the meansof giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I amsure, rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you wouldstay a little longer than you might wish. You will not regard beingtired. You will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends."</p><p>"Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should haveno scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. Iam only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your notbeing exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, youknow; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up byyourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time--and the idea ofthat would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to situp."</p><p>He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that,if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; ifhungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid shouldsit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that everything were safe in the house, as usual.</p></span><span id = 200 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's dinnerwaiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxiousfor his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray anyimperfection which could be concealed.</p><p>He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with avery good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what hehad done. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal anyconfusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve hisspirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, afterseeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:--</p><p>"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly thingsdo cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudentway. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not alwaysfolly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr.Knightley, he is <i>not</i> a trifling, silly young man. If he were,he would have done this differently. He would either have gloried inthe achievement, or been ashamed of it. There would have been eitherthe ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak todefend its own vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he is nottrifling or silly."</p><p>With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, andfor a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, andby inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; ofguessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness intoher air; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be,who were now seeing them together for the first time.</p><p>She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more thanhis propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.</p><p>Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she leftthe house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together afterdinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of herdress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helpingthem to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whateverunwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obligedthem to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinnerfor them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eatit.</p><p>She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased tosee that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, andindependence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he could,and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm fromher heart, for he stopped to hand her out.</p><p>"This is coming as you should do," said she; "like a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you."</p><p>He thanked her, observing, "How lucky that we should arrive at thesame moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubtwhether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman thanusual.-- You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look ormanner."</p><p>"Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look ofconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to bebeneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, butwith you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; Ialways observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. <i>Now</i>you have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposedashamed. You are not striving to look taller than any body else. <i>Now</i> I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you."</p><p>"Nonsensical girl!" was his reply, but not at all in anger.</p><p>Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the partyas with Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect whichcould not but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for.When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest ofadmiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approachedher with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,and at dinner she found him seated by her--and, as she firmly believed,not without some dexterity on his side.</p><p>The party was rather large, as it included one other family, aproper unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantageof naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox'sfamily, the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come inthe evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; butalready, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject ofconversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton weretalked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to thepleasantness of her neighbour. The first remote sound to which she feltherself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Coleseemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be veryinteresting. She listened, and found it well worth listening to. Thatvery dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs.Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soonas she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte--avery elegant looking instrument--not a grand, but a large-sized squarepianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end of all the dialoguewhich ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side,and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrivedfrom Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both auntand niece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account,Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who couldpossibly have ordered it-- but now, they were both perfectly satisfiedthat it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be fromColonel Campbell.</p><p>"One can suppose nothing else," added Mrs. Cole, "and I was onlysurprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence asany reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuseto surprize her."</p><p>Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on thesubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there wereenough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and stilllisten to Mrs. Cole.</p><p>"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has givenme more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax,who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemedquite a shame, especially considering how many houses there are wherefine instruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like givingourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was tellingMr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte inthe drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and ourlittle girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make anything of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music,has not any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even thepitifullest old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I wassaying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me;only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not helpindulging himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our goodneighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better usethan we can; and that really is the reason why the instrument wasbought-- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are ingreat hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it thisevening."</p><p>Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding thatnothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's,turned to Frank Churchill.</p><p>"Why do you smile?" said she.</p><p>"Nay, why do you?"</p><p>"Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present."</p><p>"Very."</p><p>"I rather wonder that it was never made before."</p><p>"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before."</p><p>"Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument-- which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body."</p><p>"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates's house."</p><p>"You may <i>say</i> what you chuse--but your countenance testifies that your <i>thoughts</i> on this subject are very much like mine."</p><p>"I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit foracuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probablysuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see whatthere is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who canbe?"</p><p>"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?"</p><p>"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. Shemust know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be;and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like ayoung woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I daresay. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine."</p><p>"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend <i>Mr</i>. Dixon in them."</p><p>"Mr. Dixon.--Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must bethe joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the otherday, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance."</p><p>"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which Ihad entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the goodintentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot helpsuspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend, hehad the misfortune to fall in love with <i>her</i>, or that he becameconscious of a little attachment on her side. One might guess twentythings without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must bea particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of goingwith the Campbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life ofprivation and penance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As tothe pretence of trying her native air, I look upon that as a mereexcuse.--In the summer it might have passed; but what can any body'snative air do for them in the months of January, February, and March?Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in mostcases of delicate health, and I dare say in her's. I do not require youto adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble a profession ofdoing it, but I honestly tell you what they are."</p><p>"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr.Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for beingvery decided."</p><p>"And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?-- A waterparty; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her."</p><p>"He did. I was there--one of the party."</p><p>"Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, for itseems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think I shouldhave made some discoveries."</p><p>"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact,that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixoncaught her.--It was the work of a moment. And though the consequentshock and alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I believeit was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again-- yet thatwas too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to beobservable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have madediscoveries."</p><p>The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to sharein the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, andobliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when thetable was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placedexactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emmasaid,</p><p>"The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted toknow a little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, weshall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon."</p><p>"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells."</p><p>"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows itis not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first.She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may nothave convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself thatMr. Dixon is a principal in the business."</p><p>"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasoningscarry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposedyou satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only aspaternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable thatit should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can seeit in no other light than as an offering of love."</p><p>There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The convictionseemed real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, othersubjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; thedessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admiredamid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a fewdownright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one northe other--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, oldnews, and heavy jokes.</p><p>The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the otherladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entreeof her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in herdignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness andthe artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so manyalleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointedaffection. There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears shehad been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself andseeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and saynothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfaxdid look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been gladto change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased themortification of having loved--yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton invain--by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herselfbeloved by the husband of her friend.</p><p>In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approachher. She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much inthe secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interestfair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others,the subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush ofconsciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush ofguilt which accompanied the name of "my excellent friend ColonelCampbell."</p><p>Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interestedby the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at herperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask andto say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wishof saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in thefair heroine's countenance.</p><p>They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very firstof the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and thehandsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Batesand her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of thecircle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,would not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must bethinking. She was his object, and every body must perceive it. Sheintroduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient momentsafterwards, heard what each thought of the other. "He had never seen solovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete." And she, "Only tobe sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did thinkthere were some looks a little like Mr. Elton." Emma restrained herindignation, and only turned from her in silence.</p><p>Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on firstglancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room-- hatedsitting long--was always the first to move when he could-- that hisfather, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy overparish business--that as long as he had staid, however, it had beenpleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set ofgentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highburyaltogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families-- that Emmabegan to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much.She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire-- the extent of theneighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from hisanswers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very littlegoing on, that their visitings were among a range of great families,none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitationsaccepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in healthand spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no freshperson; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was notwithout difficulty, without considerable address <i>at</i> <i>times</i>, that he could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.</p><p>She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken atits best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirementat home than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. Hedid not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuadedhis aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing andnoticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) hecould <i>with</i> <i>time</i> persuade her to any thing. One of thosepoints on which his influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wantedvery much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed totravel--but she would not hear of it. This had happened the yearbefore. <i>Now</i>, he said, he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.</p><p>The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father.</p><p>"I have made a most wretched discovery," said he, after a shortpause.-- "I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time. I never knewdays fly so fast. A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoymyself. But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!-- I hatethe recollection."</p><p>"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out of so few, in having your hair cut."</p><p>"No," said he, smiling, "that is no subject of regret at all. I haveno pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to beseen."</p><p>The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herselfobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored asbefore, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room atMiss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.</p><p>"What is the matter?" said she.</p><p>He started. "Thank you for rousing me," he replied. "I believe Ihave been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in soodd a way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from her. Inever saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy ofher own. I see nobody else looking like her!-- I must go and ask herwhether it is an Irish fashion. Shall I?-- Yes, I will--I declare Iwill--and you shall see how she takes it;-- whether she colours."</p><p>He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before MissFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, ashe had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly infront of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.</p><p>Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.</p><p>"This is the luxury of a large party," said she:--"one can get nearevery body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk toyou. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just likeyourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know howMiss Bates and her niece came here?"</p><p>"How?--They were invited, were not they?"</p><p>"Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming?"</p><p>"They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?"</p><p>"Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sadit would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, andcold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never sawher appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, andwould therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I couldnot bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You mayguess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, Imade my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriagewould be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it wouldbe making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful aspossible, you may be sure. `Nobody was ever so fortunate asherself!'--but with many, many thanks--`there was no occasion totrouble us, for Mr. Knightley's carriage had brought, and was to takethem home again.' I was quite surprized;--very glad, I am sure; butreally quite surprized. Such a very kind attention--and so thoughtfulan attention!-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And,in short, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to thinkthat it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I dosuspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that itwas only as an excuse for assisting them."</p><p>"Very likely," said Emma--"nothing more likely. I know no man morelikely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thingreally good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not agallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering JaneFairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and foran act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix onmore than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day--for we arrivedtogether; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word thatcould betray."</p><p>"Well," said Mrs. Weston, smiling, "you give him credit for moresimple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for whileMiss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I havenever been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the moreprobable it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr.Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping youcompany!--What do you say to it?"</p><p>"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!" exclaimed Emma. "Dear Mrs. Weston,how could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightleymust not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out fromDonwell?-- Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consentto Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. Iam amazed that you should think of such a thing."</p><p>"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do notwant the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry-- but theidea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley reallywished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's account, aboy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?"</p><p>"Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.-- Mr.Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adoptit now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!"</p><p>"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well know."</p><p>"But the imprudence of such a match!"</p><p>"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability."</p><p>"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundationthan what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you,would be quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regardfor the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax-- and is alwaysglad to shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take tomatch-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of theAbbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I wouldnot have him do so mad a thing."</p><p>"Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality offortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothingunsuitable."</p><p>"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not theleast idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?--He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep,and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fondof his brother's children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fillup his time or his heart."</p><p>"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax--"</p><p>"Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love,I am sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family;but--"</p><p>"Well," said Mrs. Weston, laughing, "perhaps the greatest good he could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home."</p><p>"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself;a very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have MissBates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, and thankinghim all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?-- `So verykind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's oldpetticoat. `Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for stillit would last a great while--and, indeed, she must thankfully say thattheir petticoats were all very strong.'"</p><p>"For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against myconscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would bemuch disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. Shemight talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would onlytalk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is not, whether itwould be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I thinkhe does. I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly ofJane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her-- his anxiety about herhealth--his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I haveheard him express himself so warmly on those points!--Such an admirerof her performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heardhim say that he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almostforgotten one idea that occurred to me--this pianoforte that has beensent here by somebody-- though we have all been so well satisfied toconsider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr.Knightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the personto do it, even without being in love."</p><p>"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I donot think it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley doesnothing mysteriously."</p><p>"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the commoncourse of things, occur to him."</p><p>"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told her so."</p><p>"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a verystrong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularlysilent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner."</p><p>"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you havemany a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment-- Ibelieve nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince methat Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax."</p><p>They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emmarather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston wasthe most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the roomshewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;-- andat the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse woulddo them the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in theeagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeingnothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr.Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, itsuited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance.</p><p>She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt morethan she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spiritin the little things which are generally acceptable, and couldaccompany her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took heragreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by FrankChurchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, andevery thing usual followed. He was accused of having a delightfulvoice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; andthat he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundlyasserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign herplace to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental,she never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitelysuperior to her own.</p><p>With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance fromthe numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sangagain. They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth.But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew awayhalf Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subjectof Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the unitedvoices gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr.Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside. She could seenothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. JohnKnightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children--amost mortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very greatdeduction from her father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, shecould not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. AMrs. Knightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley mustnever marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.</p><p>Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her.They talked at first only of the performance. His admiration wascertainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would nothave struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speakof his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answerwas in the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it toindicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.</p><p>"I often feel concern," said she, "that I dare not make our carriagemore useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish;but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James shouldput-to for such a purpose."</p><p>"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question," hereplied;-- "but you must often wish it, I am sure." And he smiled withsuch seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed anotherstep.</p><p>"This present from the Campbells," said she--"this pianoforte is very kindly given."</p><p>"Yes," he replied, and without the smallest apparentembarrassment.-- "But they would have done better had they given hernotice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is notenhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should haveexpected better judgment in Colonel Campbell."</p><p>From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightleyhad had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he wereentirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actualpreference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end ofJane's second song, her voice grew thick.</p><p>"That will do," said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud-- "you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet."</p><p>Another song, however, was soon begged for. "One more;--they wouldnot fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for onemore." And Frank Churchill was heard to say, "I think you could managethis without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strengthof the song falls on the second."</p><p>Mr. Knightley grew angry.</p><p>"That fellow," said he, indignantly, "thinks of nothing but shewingoff his own voice. This must not be." And touching Miss Bates, who atthat moment passed near--"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niecesing herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have nomercy on her."</p><p>Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even tobe grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farthersinging. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for MissWoodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; butsoon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing-- originating nobodyexactly knew where--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole,that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs.Weston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning anirresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becominggallantry to Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.</p><p>While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on hervoice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If hewere to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augursomething. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking toMrs. Cole-- he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebodyelse, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.</p><p>Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe;and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not morethan five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddennessof it made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in apartner. They were a couple worth looking at.</p><p>Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It wasgrowing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on hermother's account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted tobegin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful,and have done.</p><p>"Perhaps it is as well," said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emmato her carriage. "I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languiddancing would not have agreed with me, after your's."</p></span><span id = 201 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. Thevisit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and allthat she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignifiedseclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. Shemust have delighted the Coles--worthy people, who deserved to be madehappy!--And left a name behind her that would not soon die away.</p><p>Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were twopoints on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had nottransgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions ofJane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but ithad been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and hissubmission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration,which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought tohave held her tongue.</p><p>The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; andthere she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regretthe inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartilygrieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practisedvigorously an hour and a half.</p><p>She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet'spraise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.</p><p>"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!"</p><p>"Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her's, than a lamp is like sunshine."</p><p>"Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you playquite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Everybody last night said how well you played."</p><p>"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to bepraised, but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it."</p><p>"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does,or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr.Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked agreat deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more thanexecution."</p><p>"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet."</p><p>"Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she hadany taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.-- Thereis no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so verywell, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because shewill have to teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether shewould get into any great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?"</p><p>"Just as they always do--very vulgar."</p><p>"They told me something," said Harriet rather hesitatingly;" but it is nothing of any consequence."</p><p>Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its producing Mr. Elton.</p><p>"They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday."</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>"He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay to dinner."</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>"They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do notknow what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and staythere again next summer."</p><p>"She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should be."</p><p>"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat byher at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very gladto marry him."</p><p>"Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar girls in Highbury."</p><p>Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to gowith her. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, andin her present state, would be dangerous.</p><p>Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, wasalways very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging overmuslins and changing her mind, Emma went to the door foramusement.--Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even thebusiest part of Highbury;-- Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. WilliamCox letting himself in at the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horsesreturning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule,were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect; and when hereyes fell only on the butcher with his tray, a tidy old womantravelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two cursquarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children roundthe baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she hadno reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still tostand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeingnothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.</p><p>She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two personsappeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking intoHighbury;--to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in thefirst place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Randallsthan Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught theireye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; andthe agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give freshpleasure to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she wasgoing to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.</p><p>"For my companion tells me," said she, "that I absolutely promisedMiss Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not awareof it myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says Idid, I am going now."</p><p>"And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,"said Frank Churchill, "to join your party and wait for her atHartfield-- if you are going home."</p><p>Mrs. Weston was disappointed.</p><p>"I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased."</p><p>"Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be equally inthe way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My auntalways sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her todeath; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same.What am I to do?"</p><p>"I am here on no business of my own," said Emma; "I am only waitingfor my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall gohome. But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument."</p><p>"Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbellshould have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to havean indifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth wouldbe palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in theworld at a civil falsehood."</p><p>"I do not believe any such thing," replied Emma.--"I am persuadedthat you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary;but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quiteotherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night."</p><p>"Do come with me," said Mrs. Weston, "if it be not very disagreeableto you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards.We will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. Itwill be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it."</p><p>He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in,and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with allthe force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plainmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, beit ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. Atlast it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.</p><p>"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?" asked Mrs. Ford.--"Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield.No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs.Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown homeany day. But I shall want the ribbon directly-- so it had better go toHartfield--at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,Mrs. Ford, could not you?"</p><p>"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels."</p><p>"No more it is."</p><p>"No trouble in the world, ma'am," said the obliging Mrs. Ford.</p><p>"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, ifyou please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's-- I do notknow--No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent toHartfield, and take it home with me at night. What do you advise?"</p><p>"That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford."</p><p>"Aye, that will be much best," said Harriet, quite satisfied, "I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's."</p><p>Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.</p><p>"My dear Miss Woodhouse," said the latter, "I am just run across toentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. Howdo you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs.Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding."</p><p>"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--"</p><p>"Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfullywell; and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I amso glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you werehere.-- Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhousewill allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my motherwill be so very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party, shecannot refuse.--`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, `MissWoodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'-- But,said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go withme.--`Oh,' said he, `wait half a minute, till I have finished myjob;'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in themost obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of mymother's spectacles.--The rivet came out, you know, this morning.-- Sovery obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles-- could notput them on. And, by the bye, every body ought to have two pair ofspectacles; they should indeed. Jane said so. I meant to take them overto John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or other hinderedme all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no sayingwhat, you know. At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchenchimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your badnews to me. Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out. Thenthe baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they areextremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heardsome people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rudeanswer, but we have never known any thing but the greatest attentionfrom them. And it cannot be for the value of our custom now, for whatis our consumption of bread, you know? Only three of us.-- besides dearJane at present--and she really eats nothing--makes such a shockingbreakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it. I dare not letmy mother know how little she eats--so I say one thing and then I sayanother, and it passes off. But about the middle of the day she getshungry, and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples,and they are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the otherday of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet him in the street. Not thatI had any doubt before-- I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommenda baked apple. I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinksthe fruit thoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, veryoften. Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, youhave prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will oblige us."</p><p>Emma would be "very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &amp;c.," and theydid at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Batesthan,</p><p>"How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see youbefore. I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town.Jane came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do verywell--only a little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking themin."</p><p>"What was I talking of?" said she, beginning again when they were all in the street.</p><p>Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.</p><p>"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! mymother's spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! `Oh!'said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kindexcessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very. . . . Indeed Imust say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I hadexpected, he very far exceeds any thing. . . . I do congratulate you,Mrs. Weston, most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parentcould. . . . `Oh!' said he, `I can fasten the rivet. I like a job ofthat sort excessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when Ibrought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friendswould be so very obliging as to take some, `Oh!' said he directly,`there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are thefinest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, youknow, was so very. . . . And I am sure, by his manner, it was nocompliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallisdoes them full justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice,and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times-- butMiss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The applesthemselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; allfrom Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends usa sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping appleanywhere as one of his trees--I believe there is two of them. My mothersays the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I wasreally quite shocked the other day-- for Mr. Knightley called onemorning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them andsaid how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got tothe end of our stock. `I am sure you must be,' said he, `and I willsend you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can everuse. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual thisyear. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.' SoI begged he would not--for really as to ours being gone, I could notabsolutely say that we had a great many left--it was but half a dozenindeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at allbear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had beenalready; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almostquarrelled with me--No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had aquarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned theapples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had agreat many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could.However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a largebasket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I wasvery much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and saidevery thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an oldacquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I foundafterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of <i>that</i>sort his master had; he had brought them all--and now his master hadnot one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it himself,he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William,you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing; but Mrs.Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away. Shecould not bear that her master should not be able to have anotherapple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not mind it,and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges <i>would</i>be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold, it did notsignify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me, and I wasexcessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley know anything about it for the world! He would be so very. . . . I wanted tokeep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned itbefore I was aware."</p><p>Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitorswalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.</p><p>"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Praytake care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase-- ratherdarker and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care.Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. MissSmith, the step at the turning."</p></span><span id = 203 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, wastranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table nearher, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.</p><p>Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again.</p><p>"This is a pleasure," said he, in rather a low voice, "coming atleast ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying tobe useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed."</p><p>"What!" said Mrs. Weston, "have not you finished it yet? you wouldnot earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate."</p><p>"I have not been working uninterruptedly," he replied, "I have beenassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You seewe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you tobe persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home."</p><p>He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficientlyemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying tomake her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quiteready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediatelyready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she hadnot yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it withoutemotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; andEmma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and couldnot but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.</p><p>At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, thepowers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joinedher in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every properdiscrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.</p><p>"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ," said Frank Churchill, witha smile at Emma, "the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal ofColonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the uppernotes I am sure is exactly what he and <i>all</i> <i>that</i> <i>party</i>would particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gavehis friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Donot you think so?"</p><p>Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment.</p><p>"It is not fair," said Emma, in a whisper; "mine was a random guess. Do not distress her."</p><p>He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,</p><p>"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure onthis occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, andwonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument'scoming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business tobe going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be theconsequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may havesent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, todepend upon contingencies and conveniences?"</p><p>He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,</p><p>"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell," said she, in a voiceof forced calmness, "I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It mustbe all conjecture."</p><p>"Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes oneconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make thisrivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard atwork, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold theirtongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word--MissFairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I havethe pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles,healed for the present."</p><p>He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape alittle from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged MissFairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.</p><p>"If you are very kind," said he, "it will be one of the waltzes wedanced last night;--let me live them over again. You did not enjoy themas I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad wedanced no longer; but I would have given worlds-- all the worlds oneever has to give--for another half-hour."</p><p>She played.</p><p>"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which <i>has</i> made one happy!-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth."</p><p>She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and playedsomething else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,and turning to Emma, said,</p><p>"Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.-- Andhere are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, onemight expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful ofColonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no musichere. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it tohave been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothingincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it."</p><p>Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help beingamused; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caughtthe remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush ofconsciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had lessscruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect toher.--This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparentlycherishing very reprehensible feelings.</p><p>He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.-- Emma took the opportunity of whispering,</p><p>"You speak too plain. She must understand you."</p><p>"I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning."</p><p>"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea."</p><p>"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I havenow a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If shedoes wrong, she ought to feel it."</p><p>"She is not entirely without it, I think."</p><p>"I do not see much sign of it. She is playing <i>Robin</i> <i>Adair</i> at this moment--<i>his</i> favourite."</p><p>Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off.</p><p>"Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible, just tothank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;but I can go into my mother's room you know. I dare say he will come inwhen he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meetso!--Our little room so honoured!"</p><p>She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and openingthe casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, andevery syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by theothers, as if it had passed within the same apartment.</p><p>"How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged toyou for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother justready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friendshere."</p><p>So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heardin his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,</p><p>"How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all,but particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught nocold last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is."</p><p>And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he wouldhear her in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Westongave Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her headin steady scepticism.</p><p>"So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage," resumed Miss Bates.</p><p>He cut her short with,</p><p>"I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?"</p><p>"Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston."</p><p>"Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for <i>you</i>?"</p><p>"No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?-- MissWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the newpianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in."</p><p>"Well," said he, in a deliberating manner, "for five minutes, perhaps."</p><p>"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful; so many friends!"</p><p>"No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can."</p><p>"Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you."</p><p>"No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the pianoforte."</p><p>"Well, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful partylast night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I neversaw any thing equal to it."</p><p>"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I supposeMiss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing thatpasses. And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why MissFairfax should not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances verywell; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player, withoutexception, in England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, theywill say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannotstay to hear it."</p><p>"Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence-- so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!"</p><p>"What is the matter now?"</p><p>"To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you hada great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. Youshould not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He nevercan bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and itwould have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . Well, (returning tothe room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop.He is going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing. . . ."</p><p>"Yes," said Jane, "we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing."</p><p>"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the doorwas open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. Youmust have heard every thing to be sure. `Can I do any thing for you atKingston?' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . Oh! Miss Woodhouse, mustyou be going?--You seem but just come--so very obliging of you."</p><p>Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had alreadylasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning wasperceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leavealso, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies toHartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.</p></span><span id = 206 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances havebeen known of young people passing many, many months successively,without being at any ball of any description, and no material injuryaccrue either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made-- when thefelicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt--itmust be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.</p><p>Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to danceagain; and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse waspersuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the twoyoung people in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; andhis the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judgeof the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation andappearance. But still she had inclination enough for shewing peopleagain how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhousedanced--for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herselfwith Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself, without any ofthe wicked aids of vanity--to assist him first in pacing out the roomthey were in to see what it could be made to hold--and then in takingthe dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, inspite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size,that it was a little the largest.</p><p>His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr.Cole's should be finished there--that the same party should becollected, and the same musician engaged, met with the readiestacquiescence. Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment,and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they couldwish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed, ofreckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out theindispensable division of space to every couple.</p><p>"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the twoMiss Coxes five," had been repeated many times over. "And there will bethe two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr.Knightley. Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and MissSmith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five;and for five couple there will be plenty of room."</p><p>But soon it came to be on one side,</p><p>"But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think there will."</p><p>On another,</p><p>"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while tostand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.It will not do to <i>invite</i> five couple. It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment."</p><p>Somebody said that <i>Miss</i> Gilbert was expected at her brother's, and must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed <i>Mrs</i>.Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. Aword was put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston namingone family of cousins who must be included, and another of very oldacquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that thefive couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculationin what possible manner they could be disposed of.</p><p>The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. "Might notthey use both rooms, and dance across the passage?" It seemed the bestscheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted abetter. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distressabout the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the scoreof health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not bepersevered in.</p><p>"Oh! no," said he; "it would be the extreme of imprudence. I couldnot bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadfulcold. So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, youwould be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Praydo not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is verythoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quitethe thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening, andkeeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of thedraught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is notquite the thing!"</p><p>Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance ofit, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was nowclosed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing onlyin the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will onFrank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hourbefore had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was nowendeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.</p><p>"We were too magnificent," said he. "We allowed unnecessary room. Ten couple may stand here very well."</p><p>Emma demurred. "It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in?"</p><p>"Very true," he gravely replied; "it was very bad." But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,</p><p>"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."</p><p>"No, no," said she, "you are quite unreasonable. It would bedreadful to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasurethan to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!"</p><p>"There is no denying it," he replied. "I agree with you exactly. Acrowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of givingpictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however,having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. Itwould be a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do not knowthat--I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here verywell."</p><p>Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a littleself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure ofdancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.Had she intended ever to <i>marry</i> him, it might have been worthwhile to pause and consider, and try to understand the value of hispreference, and the character of his temper; but for all the purposesof their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.</p><p>Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and heentered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified thecontinuance of the scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce animprovement.</p><p>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," he almost immediately began, "yourinclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, bythe terrors of my father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal on thesubject:--a thought of my father's, which waits only your approbationto be acted upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the twofirst dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not atRandalls, but at the Crown Inn?"</p><p>"The Crown!"</p><p>"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust youcannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit himthere. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a lessgrateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston seesno objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we allfeel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of theRandalls rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt howright you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing <i>any</i> <i>thing</i> to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?--You consent-- I hope you consent?"</p><p>"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer formyself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement that couldbe. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?"</p><p>She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fullycomprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations werenecessary to make it acceptable.</p><p>"No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--much worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp anddangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they mustdance, they had better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the roomat the Crown in his life--did not know the people who kept it bysight.--Oh! no--a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at theCrown than anywhere."</p><p>"I was going to observe, sir," said Frank Churchill, "that one ofthe great recommendations of this change would be the very littledanger of any body's catching cold-- so much less danger at the Crownthan at Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration,but nobody else could."</p><p>"Sir," said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, "you are very muchmistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr.Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do notunderstand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than yourfather's house."</p><p>"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall haveno occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; andit is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold airupon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief."</p><p>"Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think ofopening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I neverheard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neitheryour father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would sufferit."</p><p>"Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behinda window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. Ihave often known it done myself."</p><p>"Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me! I never could have supposed it.But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear.However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come totalk it over--but these sort of things require a good deal ofconsideration. One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs.Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk itover, and see what can be done."</p><p>"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--"</p><p>"Oh!" interrupted Emma, "there will be plenty of time for talkingevery thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived tobe at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. Theywill be so near their own stable."</p><p>"So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James evercomplains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I couldbe sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is Mrs. Stokes to betrusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight."</p><p>"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it willbe under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct thewhole."</p><p>"There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston,who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, somany years ago, when I had the measles? `If <i>Miss</i> <i>Taylor</i>undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' Howoften have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!"</p><p>"Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poorlittle Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you wouldhave been very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came four timesa day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very goodsort--which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadfulcomplaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have themeasles, she will send for Perry."</p><p>"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment," saidFrank Churchill, "examining the capabilities of the house. I left themthere and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hopingyou might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. Iwas desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure tothem, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothingsatisfactorily without you."</p><p>Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young peopleset off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy andvery happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; andhe, finding every thing perfect.</p><p>"Emma," said she, "this paper is worse than I expected. Look! inplaces you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellowand forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."</p><p>"My dear, you are too particular," said her husband. "What does allthat signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be asclean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on ourclub-nights."</p><p>The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, "Men neverknow when things are dirty or not;" and the gentlemen perhaps thoughteach to himself, "Women will have their little nonsenses and needlesscares."</p><p>One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.It regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built,suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, wasthe only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wantedas a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary bytheir four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortablesupper? Another room of much better size might be secured for thepurpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkwardpassage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; andneither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of beingmiserably crowded at supper.</p><p>Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,&amp;c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretchedsuggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, waspronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs.Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line ofexpediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,</p><p>"I do not think it <i>is</i> so very small. We shall not be many, you know."</p><p>And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out,</p><p>"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It isa mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs."</p><p>"I wish," said Mrs. Weston, "one could know which arrangement ourguests in general would like best. To do what would be most generallypleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be."</p><p>"Yes, very true," cried Frank, "very true. You want your neighbours'opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chiefof them--the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I callupon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.-- And I do not knowwhether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations ofthe rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a largercouncil. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?"</p><p>"Well--if you please," said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, "if you think she will be of any use."</p><p>"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates," said Emma."She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing.She will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage inconsulting Miss Bates."</p><p>"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond ofhearing Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, youknow."</p><p>Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it his decided approbation.</p><p>"Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matterat once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know aproperer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch MissBates. We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson ofhow to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both."</p><p>"Both sir! Can the old lady?" . . .</p><p>"The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you agreat blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece."</p><p>"Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both."And away he ran.</p><p>Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-movingaunt, and her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered womanand a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils ofit much less than she had supposed before-- indeed very trifling; andhere ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculationat least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table andchair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were leftas mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.Stokes.-- Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had alreadywritten to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,which could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was tobe.</p><p>Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safercharacter,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general andminute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for anotherhalf-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the differentrooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment ofthe future. The party did not break up without Emma's being positivelysecured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, norwithout her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, "He has askedher, my dear. That's right. I knew he would!"</p></span><span id = 207 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ballcompletely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within thegranted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr.Weston's confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that theChurchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond hisfortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must taketheir time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week wereentered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding andhoping in uncertainty--at the risk-- in her opinion, the great risk, ofits being all in vain.</p><p>Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. Hiswish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was notopposed. All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of onesolicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain ofher ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provokingindifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, orbecause the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he seemedresolved that it should not interest him, determined against itsexciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,than,</p><p>"Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all thistrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to sayagainst it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.-- Oh! yes,I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as Ican; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins'sweek's account; much rather, I confess.-- Pleasure in seeingdancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it-- I do not know whodoes.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something verydifferent."</p><p>This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It wasnot in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent,or so indignant; he was not guided by <i>her</i> feelings in reprobating the ball, for <i>she</i> enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It made her animated--open hearted-- she voluntarily said;--</p><p>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with<i>very</i> great pleasure."</p><p>It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would havepreferred the society of William Larkins. No!--she was more and moreconvinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. Therewas a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on hisside--but no love.</p><p>Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley.Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throwof every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge hisnephew's instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell-- far too unwell todo without him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said herhusband) when writing to her nephew two days before, though from herusual unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinkingof herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill totrifle, and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.</p><p>The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note fromMrs. Weston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must begone within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for hisaunt, to lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they neveroccurred but for her own convenience.</p><p>Mrs. Weston added, "that he could only allow himself time to hurryto Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends therewhom he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might beexpected at Hartfield very soon."</p><p>This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once ithad been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim.The loss of the ball--the loss of the young man-- and all that theyoung man might be feeling!--It was too wretched!-- Such a delightfulevening as it would have been!--Every body so happy! and she and herpartner the happiest!--"I said it would be so," was the onlyconsolation.</p><p>Her father's feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally ofMrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; andas for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; butthey would all be safer at home.</p><p>Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but ifthis reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and totalwant of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the goingaway almost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. Hesat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousinghimself, it was only to say,</p><p>"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst."</p><p>"But you will come again," said Emma. "This will not be your only visit to Randalls."</p><p>"Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able toreturn!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of allmy thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town thisspring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring-- I am afraid itis a custom gone for ever."</p><p>"Our poor ball must be quite given up."</p><p>"Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize thepleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh! Miss Woodhouse,why are you always so right?"</p><p>"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much rather have been merry than wise."</p><p>"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends on it. Do not forget your engagement."</p><p>Emma looked graciously.</p><p>"Such a fortnight as it has been!" he continued; "every day moreprecious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making meless fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain atHighbury!"</p><p>"As you do us such ample justice now," said Emma, laughing, "I willventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sureyou did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long incoming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury."</p><p>He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma was convinced that it had been so.</p><p>"And you must be off this very morning?"</p><p>"Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, andI must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment willbring him."</p><p>"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax andMiss Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mindmight have strengthened yours."</p><p>"Yes--I <i>have</i> called there; passing the door, I thought itbetter. It was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, andwas detained by Miss Bates's being absent. She was out; and I felt itimpossible not to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may,that one <i>must</i> laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my visit, then"--</p><p>He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.</p><p>"In short," said he, "perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion"--</p><p>He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardlyknew what to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutelyserious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore,in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,</p><p>"You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then"--</p><p>He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probablyreflecting on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner.She heard him sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had <i>cause</i>to sigh. He could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkwardmoments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined mannersaid,</p><p>"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm"--</p><p>He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.-- He wasmore in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how itmight have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr.Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made himcomposed.</p><p>A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable ofprocrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any thatwas doubtful, said, "It was time to go;" and the young man, though hemight and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.</p><p>"I shall hear about you all," said he; "that is my chiefconsolation. I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. Ihave engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind asto promise it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one isreally interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing. In herletters I shall be at dear Highbury again."</p><p>A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest "Good-bye," closedthe speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short hadbeen the notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt sosorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society fromhis absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling ittoo much.</p><p>It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day sincehis arrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit tothe last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation ofseeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of hisattentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happyfortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the commoncourse of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, hehad <i>almost</i> told her that he loved her. What strength, or whatconstancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; butat present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration,a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to allthe rest, made her think that she <i>must</i> be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous determination against it.</p><p>"I certainly must," said she. "This sensation of listlessness,weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employmyself, this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about thehouse!-- I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in theworld if I were not--for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some isalways good to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball,if not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He mayspend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes."</p><p>Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could notsay that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look wouldhave contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, thathe was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and withconsiderable kindness added,</p><p>"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!"</p><p>It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honestregret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure wasodious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering fromheadache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the balltaken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it wascharity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor ofill-health.</p></span><span id = 208 ><p><br clear="&quot;&quot;all&quot;&quot;" /></p><p>Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideasonly varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a gooddeal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearingFrank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure thanever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, howwere his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of hiscoming to Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she couldnot admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to beless disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy andcheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to havefaults; and farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she satdrawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progressand close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, andinventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginarydeclaration on his side was that she <i>refused</i> <i>him</i>. Theiraffection was always to subside into friendship. Every thing tender andcharming was to mark their parting; but still they were to part. Whenshe became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be verymuch in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determinationnever to quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainlymust produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her ownfeelings.</p><p>"I do not find myself making any use of the word <i>sacrifice</i>,"said she.-- "In not one of all my clever replies, my delicatenegatives, is there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspectthat he is not really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. Icertainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quiteenough in love. I should be sorry to be more."</p><p>Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.</p><p>"<i>He</i> is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotesit--very much in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if hisaffection continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--Itwould be most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite madeup. Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging himhitherto. No, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, hewould not have been so wretched. Could he have thought himselfencouraged, his looks and language at parting would have beendifferent.-- Still, however, I must be on my guard. This is in thesupposition of his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do notknow that I expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sortof man-- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.--His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.--Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful that myhappiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well againafter a little while--and then, it will be a good thing over; for theysay every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall have beenlet off easily."</p><p>When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it;and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made herat first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she hadundervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, givingthe particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all theaffection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, anddescribing every thing exterior and local that could be supposedattractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now ofapology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrastbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life wasjust enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how muchmore might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--Thecharm of her own name was not wanting. <i>Miss</i> <i>Woodhouse</i>appeared more than once, and never without a something of pleasingconnexion, either a compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of whatshe had said; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye,unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yetcould discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatestcompliment perhaps of all conveyed. Compressed into the very lowestvacant corner were these words--"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday,as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend. Pray make myexcuses and adieus to her." This, Emma could not doubt, was all forherself. Harriet was remembered only from being <i>her</i> friend. Hisinformation and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor betterthan had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he darednot yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randallsagain.</p><p>Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in thematerial part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up andreturned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, thatshe could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to dowithout her. Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusalonly grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for hissubsequent consolation and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, andthe words which clothed it, the "beautiful little friend," suggested toher the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. Was itimpossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior inunderstanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness ofher face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all theprobabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--ForHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.</p><p>"I must not dwell upon it," said she.--"I must not think of it. Iknow the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger thingshave happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now,it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of truedisinterested friendship which I can already look forward to withpleasure."</p><p>It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, thoughit might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in thatquarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr.Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latestinterest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon FrankChurchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the mostirresistible form.--His wedding-day was named. He would soon be amongthem again; Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk overthe first letter from Enscombe before "Mr. Elton and his bride" was inevery body's mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sickat the sound. She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr.Elton; and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had beenlately gaining strength. With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, therehad been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was nowtoo evident that she had not attained such a state of composure ascould stand against the actual approach--new carriage, bell-ringing,and all.</p><p>Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all thereasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma couldgive. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriethad a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavywork to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for everagreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harrietlistened submissively, and said "it was very true-- it was just as MissWoodhouse described--it was not worth while to think about them--andshe would not think about them any longer" but no change of subjectcould avail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restlessabout the Eltons as before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.</p><p>"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make <i>me</i>.You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. Itwas all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assureyou.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you-- and it willbe a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger offorgetting it."</p><p>Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation. Emma continued,</p><p>"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less,talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, Iwould wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important thanmy comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what isyour duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid thesuspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore yourtranquillity. These are the motives which I have been pressing on you.They are very important--and sorry I am that you cannot feel themsufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain is a verysecondary consideration. I want you to save yourself from greater pain.Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget whatwas due--or rather what would be kind by me."</p><p>This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The ideaof wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom shereally loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when theviolence of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough toprompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably.</p><p>"You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life-- Wantgratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I dofor you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!"</p><p>Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look andmanner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet sowell, nor valued her affection so highly before.</p><p>"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart," said sheafterwards to herself. "There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmthand tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beatall the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure itwill. It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generallybeloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.-- I have it not--butI know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all thecharm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!--I would not changeyou for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging femalebreathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth ahundred such--And for a wife-- a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable.I mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!"</p></span><span id = 211 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might beinterrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, andit must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, tosettle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, ornot pretty at all.</p><p>Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, tomake her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and shemade a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of thebusiness might be gone through as soon as possible.</p><p>She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same roomto which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, tolace up her boot, without <i>recollecting</i>. A thousand vexatiousthoughts would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; andit was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollectingtoo; but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent.The visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment andoccupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herselfentirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one,beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being "elegantly dressed, and verypleasing."</p><p>She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to findfault, but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but notelegance.-- She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, abride, there was too much ease. Her person was rather good; her facenot unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, wereelegant. Emma thought at least it would turn out so.</p><p>As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would notpermit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It wasan awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and aman had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The womanwas better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and theprivilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense todepend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had justmarried, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he hadbeen expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look aslittle wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy ascould be.</p><p>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," said Harriet, when they had quitted thehouse, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; "Well, MissWoodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?-- Is not shevery charming?"</p><p>There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.</p><p>"Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman."</p><p>"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful."</p><p>"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."</p><p>"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love."</p><p>"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and she came in his way."</p><p>"I dare say," returned Harriet, sighing again, "I dare say she was very much attached to him."</p><p>"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry thewoman who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, andthought this the best offer she was likely to have."</p><p>"Yes," said Harriet earnestly, "and well she might, nobody couldever have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now,Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He isjust as superior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite adifferent thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; Ican sit and admire him now without any great misery. To know that hehas not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!-- She does seem acharming young woman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! He calledher `Augusta.' How delightful!"</p><p>When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could thensee more and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be atHartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she hada quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and couldcomposedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convincedher that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied withherself, and thinking much of her own importance; that she meant toshine and be very superior, but with manners which had been formed in abad school, pert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from oneset of people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she wasignorant, and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.</p><p>Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refinedherself, she would have connected him with those who were; but MissHawkins, it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had beenthe best of her own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was thepride of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the prideof him.</p><p>The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, "Mybrother Mr. Suckling's seat;"--a comparison of Hartfield to MapleGrove. The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; andthe house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourablyimpressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she couldsee or imagine. "Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck bythe likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of themorning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room."-- Mr. Eltonwas appealed to.--"Was not it astonishingly like?-- She could reallyalmost fancy herself at Maple Grove."</p><p>"And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very likethe staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. Ireally could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it isvery delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremelypartial to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there!(with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Everybody who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quitea home. Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, youwill understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at alllike what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of theevils of matrimony."</p><p>Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.</p><p>"So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house-- thegrounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and standvery much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse ofa fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly inmind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. Peoplewho have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thingin the same style."</p><p>Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea thatpeople who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for theextensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while toattack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,</p><p>"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties."</p><p>"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you know. Surry is the garden of England."</p><p>"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Manycounties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well asSurry."</p><p>"No, I fancy not," replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile." I never heard any county but Surry called so."</p><p>Emma was silenced.</p><p>"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, orsummer at farthest," continued Mrs. Elton; "and that will be our timefor exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, Idare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holdsfour perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of <i>our</i>carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremelywell. They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that seasonof the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedlyrecommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very muchpreferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, youknow, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much aspossible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We exploredto King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully,just after their first having the barouche-landau. You have manyparties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?"</p><p>"No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the verystriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; andwe are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay athome than engage in schemes of pleasure."</p><p>"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobodycan be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it atMaple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going toBristol, `I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. Iabsolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in thebarouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with herown good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a timehas she said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. Ithink, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely fromsociety, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable tomix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either toomuch or too little. I perfectly understand your situation, however,Miss Woodhouse-- (looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's stateof health must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?--Indeedhe should. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubtof its doing Mr. Woodhouse good."</p><p>"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receivingany benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown toyou, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now."</p><p>"Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, wherethe waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In myBath life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful aplace, that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse'sspirits, which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as toits recommendations to <i>you</i>, I fancy I need not take much painsto dwell on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are prettygenerally understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, whohave lived so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you someof the best society in the place. A line from me would bring you alittle host of acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge,the lady I have always resided with when in Bath, would be most happyto shew you any attentions, and would be the very person for you to gointo public with."</p><p>It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an <i>introduction</i>--ofher going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs.Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help of aboarder, just made a shift to live!-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, ofHartfield, was sunk indeed!</p><p>She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she couldhave given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; "but their going toBath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convincedthat the place might suit her better than her father." And then, toprevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.</p><p>"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon theseoccasions, a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury haslong known that you are a superior performer."</p><p>"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superiorperformer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial aquarter your information came. I am doatingly fond ofmusic--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoidof taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is <i>mediocre</i>to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, playdelightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am gotinto. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of lifeto me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both atMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. Ihonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home,and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should bedisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I hadbeen accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that <i>the</i> <i>world</i>I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear ofretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world wasnot necessary to <i>me</i>. I could do very well without it. To thosewho had no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made mequite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been usedto, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equalto any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomedto every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriageswere not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments.`But,' said I, `to be quite honest, I do not think I can live withoutsomething of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; butwithout music, life would be a blank to me.'"</p><p>"We cannot suppose," said Emma, smiling, "that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a <i>very</i>musical society in Highbury; and I hope you will not find he hasoutstepped the truth more than may be pardoned, in consideration of themotive."</p><p>"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted tofind myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet littleconcerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish amusical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.Will not it be a good plan? If <i>we</i> exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for <i>me</i>,as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against them, in general. They are but too apt togive up music."</p><p>"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger, surely?"</p><p>"I should hope not; but really when I look around among myacquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--nevertouches the instrument--though she played sweetly. And the same may besaid of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the twoMilmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I canenumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used tobe quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that amarried woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I washalf an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper."</p><p>"But every thing of that kind," said Emma, "will soon be in so regular a train--"</p><p>"Well," said Mrs. Elton, laughing, "we shall see."</p><p>Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, hadnothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton choseanother subject.</p><p>"We have been calling at Randalls," said she, "and found them bothat home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like themextremely. Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature-- quite a first-ratefavourite with me already, I assure you. And <i>she</i> appears sotruly good--there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about her,that it wins upon one directly. She was your governess, I think?"</p><p>Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.</p><p>"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman."</p><p>"Mrs. Weston's manners," said Emma, "were always particularly good.Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safestmodel for any young woman."</p><p>"And who do you think came in while we were there?"</p><p>Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance-- and how could she possibly guess?</p><p>"Knightley!" continued Mrs. Elton; "Knightley himself!--Was not itlucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day, I had neverseen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s,I had a great curiosity. `My friend Knightley' had been so oftenmentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do mycaro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of hisfriend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much.Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man."</p><p>Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could breathe.</p><p>"Insufferable woman!" was her immediate exclamation. "Worse than Ihad supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I could not havebelieved it. Knightley!--never seen him in her life before, and callhim Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her <i>caro</i> <i>sposo</i>, andher resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbredfinery. Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubtwhether he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. Icould not have believed it! And to propose that she and I should uniteto form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.Weston!-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be agentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyondmy hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would FrankChurchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted hewould be! Ah! there I am-- thinking of him directly. Always the firstperson to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comesas regularly into my mind!"--</p><p>All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time herfather had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure,and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.</p><p>"Well, my dear," he deliberately began, "considering we never sawher before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare sayshe was very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. Alittle quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But Ibelieve I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks likeyou and poor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging,pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife.Though I think he had better not have married. I made the best excusesI could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on thishappy occasion; I said that I hoped I <i>should</i> in the course ofthe summer. But I ought to have gone before. Not to wait upon a brideis very remiss. Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am! But I do not likethe corner into Vicarage Lane."</p><p>"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you."</p><p>"Yes: but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible. It was being very deficient."</p><p>"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a <i>bride</i>? It ought to be no recommendation to <i>you</i>. It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them."</p><p>"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I wouldalways wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride,especially, is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to <i>her</i>. A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who they may."</p><p>"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not knowwhat is. And I should never have expected you to be lending yoursanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies."</p><p>"My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere commonpoliteness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with anyencouragement to people to marry."</p><p>Emma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand <i>her</i>. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long, did they occupy her.</p></span><span id = 214 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract herill opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct.Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such sheappeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar,ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a littleaccomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself comingwith superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a countryneighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place insociety as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.</p><p>There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differentlyfrom his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He hadthe air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman toHighbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater partof her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit ofjudging, following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it forgranted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as sheprofessed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton'spraise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded byMiss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talkedwith a good grace of her being "very pleasant and very elegantlydressed."</p><p>In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared atfirst. Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by thelittle encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drewback in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; andthough the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it wasnecessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her manners, too--and Mr.Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering andnegligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but thesensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both verymuch.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had beenan offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story,under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing tohim, had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, theobject of their joint dislike.-- When they had nothing else to say, itmust be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmitywhich they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broadervent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.</p><p>Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first.Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might besupposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she wasnot satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration-- butwithout solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting toassist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, andabout the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton'sknight-errantry on the subject.--</p><p>"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite raveabout Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild andladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has veryextraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremelywell. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! sheis absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, upon my word,I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.-- And her situation is socalculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves andendeavour to do something for her. We must bring her forward. Suchtalent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say youhave heard those charming lines of the poet,</p><blockquote><p>`Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />`And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'</p></blockquote><p>We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax."</p><p>"I cannot think there is any danger of it," was Emma's calm answer--"and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation andunderstand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, Ihave no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown."</p><p>"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, suchobscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyedwith the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that shefeels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I mustconfess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate fortimidity--and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in thosewho are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assureyou, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me morethan I can express."</p><p>"You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or anyof Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known herlonger than yourself, can shew her any other attention than"--</p><p>"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act. You and I need not be afraid. If <i>we</i> set the example, many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. <i>We</i> have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and <i>we</i>live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, atany time, the least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased ifWright were to send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret havingasked <i>more</i> than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of thing. It is not likely that I <i>should</i>,considering what I have been used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, inhousekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and beingtoo careless of expense. Maple Grove will probably be my model morethan it ought to be-- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother,Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, my resolution is taken as tonoticing Jane Fairfax.-- I shall certainly have her very often at myhouse, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall have musical partiesto draw out her talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for aneligible situation. My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I havelittle doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shallintroduce her, of course, very particularly to my brother and sisterwhen they come to us. I am sure they will like her extremely; and whenshe gets a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wearoff, for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what ishighly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they arewith me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in thebarouche-landau in some of our exploring parties."</p><p>"Poor Jane Fairfax!"--thought Emma.--"You have not deserved this.You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is apunishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness andprotection of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens!Let me not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of thatwoman's tongue!"</p><p>Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any soexclusively addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a"dear Miss Woodhouse." The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwardsappeared, and she was left in peace--neither forced to be the veryparticular friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, thevery active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others ina general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what wasdone.</p><p>She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for Mrs.Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guilelesssimplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies-- the mostamiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished andcondescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's onlysurprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions andtolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking withthe Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons!This was astonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that thetaste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society andfriendship as the Vicarage had to offer.</p><p>"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!" said she.--"To chuse to remainhere month after month, under privations of every sort! And now tochuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of herconversation, rather than return to the superior companions who havealways loved her with such real, generous affection."</p><p>Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; theCampbells were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbellshad promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and freshinvitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to MissBates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friendscontrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she haddeclined it!</p><p>"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusingthis invitation," was Emma's conclusion. "She must be under some sortof penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There isgreat fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.-- She is <i>not</i> to be with the <i>Dixons</i>. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle."</p><p>Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject,before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston venturedthis apology for Jane.</p><p>"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is agood creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. Wemust consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste forwhat she goes to."</p><p>"You are right, Mrs. Weston," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "MissFairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs.Elton. Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not havechosen her. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receivesattentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her."</p><p>Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; andshe was herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presentlyreplied,</p><p>"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, wouldrather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations Ishould have imagined any thing but inviting."</p><p>"I should not wonder," said Mrs. Weston, "if Miss Fairfax were tohave been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagernessin accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may verylikely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greaterappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, inspite of the very natural wish of a little change."</p><p>Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few minutes silence, he said,</p><p>"Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton does not talk <i>to</i> Miss Fairfax as she speaks <i>of</i>her. We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she andthou, the plainest spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of asomething beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with eachother-- a something more early implanted. We cannot give any body thedisagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before.We feel things differently. And besides the operation of this, as ageneral principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton byher superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs.Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to. Such awoman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton's waybefore--and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her owncomparative littleness in action, if not in consciousness."</p><p>"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax," said Emma. LittleHenry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made herirresolute what else to say.</p><p>"Yes," he replied, "any body may know how highly I think of her."</p><p>"And yet," said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, butsoon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once-- shehurried on--"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself howhighly it is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprizesome day or other."</p><p>Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thickleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, orsome other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,</p><p>"Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago."</p><p>He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not herself know what to think. In a moment he went on--</p><p>"That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I daresay, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very sure I shallnever ask her."</p><p>Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased enough to exclaim,</p><p>"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you."</p><p>He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,</p><p>"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?"</p><p>"No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much formatch-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What Isaid just now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course,without any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have notthe smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. Youwould not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you weremarried."</p><p>Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was,"No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will evertake me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way, Iassure you." And soon afterwards, "Jane Fairfax is a very charmingyoung woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. Shehas not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife."</p><p>Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. "Well," said she, "and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?"</p><p>"Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he wasmistaken; he asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to bewiser or wittier than his neighbours."</p><p>"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiserand wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--what she calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deepenough in familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley--what can she dofor Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax acceptsher civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argumentweighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptationof getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph ofMiss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton'sacknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in herbeing under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitorwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not becontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuringher a permanent situation to the including her in those delightfulexploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau."</p><p>"Jane Fairfax has feeling," said Mr. Knightley--"I do not accuse herof want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong--and hertemper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-controul;but it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, thanshe used to be--And I love an open temper. No--till Cole alluded to mysupposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfaxand conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always--but withno thought beyond."</p><p>"Well, Mrs. Weston," said Emma triumphantly when he left them, "what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?"</p><p>"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of <i>not</i> being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me."</p></span><span id = 216 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, wasdisposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties andevening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowedin so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they werenever to have a disengaged day.</p><p>"I see how it is," said she. "I see what a life I am to lead amongyou. Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seemquite the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing veryformidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not adisengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need nothave been at a loss."</p><p>No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits madeevening-parties perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given hera taste for dinners. She was a little shocked at the want of twodrawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being noice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddardand others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, butshe would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged. In thecourse of the spring she must return their civilities by one verysuperior party--in which her card-tables should be set out with theirseparate candles and unbroken packs in the true style--and more waitersengaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish, tocarry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in theproper order.</p><p>Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner atHartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or sheshould be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitifulresentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it forten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made theusual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.</p><p>The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides theEltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all ofcourse-- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harrietmust be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not givenwith equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularlypleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it. "She wouldrather not be in his company more than she could help. She was not yetquite able to see him and his charming happy wife together, withoutfeeling uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, shewould rather stay at home." It was precisely what Emma would havewished, had she deemed it possible enough for wishing. She wasdelighted with the fortitude of her little friend--for fortitude sheknew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home; andshe could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make theeighth, Jane Fairfax.-- Since her last conversation with Mrs. Westonand Mr. Knightley, she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfaxthan she had often been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her. He hadsaid that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobodyelse paid her.</p><p>"This is very true," said she, "at least as far as relates to me,which was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the sameage-- and always knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--She will never like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I willshew her greater attention than I have done."</p><p>Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and allhappy.-- The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yetover. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest littleKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of someweeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, andstaying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very dayof this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his beingput off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happeningso. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as theutmost that his nerves could bear-- and here would be a ninth--and Emmaapprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at notbeing able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours withoutfalling in with a dinner-party.</p><p>She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, byrepresenting that though he certainly would make them nine, yet healways said so little, that the increase of noise would be veryimmaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, tohave him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to herinstead of his brother.</p><p>The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. JohnKnightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town andmust be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in theevening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and thephilosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed thechief of even Emma's vexation.</p><p>The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. JohnKnightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of beingagreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while theywaited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, aselegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but MissFairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk toher. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walkwith his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It wasnatural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,</p><p>"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I amsure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time. I hope youturned directly."</p><p>"I went only to the post-office," said she, "and reached home beforethe rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letterswhen I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. Awalk before breakfast does me good."</p><p>"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine."</p><p>"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out."</p><p>Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,</p><p>"That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not sixyards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; andHenry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When youhave lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worthgoing through the rain for."</p><p>There was a little blush, and then this answer,</p><p>"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst ofevery dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simplygrowing older should make me indifferent about letters."</p><p>"Indifferent! Oh! no--I never conceived you could becomeindifferent. Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generallya very positive curse."</p><p>"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of friendship."</p><p>"I have often thought them the worst of the two," replied he coolly."Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does."</p><p>"Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well-- Iam very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as anybody. I can easily believe that letters are very little to you, muchless than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myselfwhich makes the difference, it is not age, but situation. You haveevery body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shallagain; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, apost-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out, in worseweather than to-day."</p><p>"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress ofyears," said John Knightley, "I meant to imply the change of situationwhich time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Timewill generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within thedaily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you. As anold friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten yearshence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have."</p><p>It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant"thank you" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip,a tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Herattention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to hiscustom on such occasions, making the circle of his guests, and payinghis particular compliments to the ladies, was ending with her--and withall his mildest urbanity, said,</p><p>"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out thismorning in the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.--Young ladies are delicate plants. They should take care of their healthand their complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?"</p><p>"Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me."</p><p>"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my veryold friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. Youdo us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I areboth highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatestsatisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield."</p><p>The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel thathe had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.</p><p>By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.</p><p>"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in therain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you dosuch a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you."</p><p>Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.</p><p>"Oh! do not tell <i>me</i>. You really are a very sad girl, and donot know how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed! Mrs.Weston, did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert ourauthority."</p><p>"My advice," said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, "I certainlydo feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to beparticularly careful, especially at this time of year. The spring Ialways think requires more than common care. Better wait an hour ortwo, or even half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringingon your cough again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sureyou are much too reasonable. You look as if you would not do such athing again."</p><p>"Oh! she <i>shall</i> <i>not</i> do such a thing again," eagerlyrejoined Mrs. Elton. "We will not allow her to do such a thingagain:"-- and nodding significantly--"there must be some arrangementmade, there must indeed. I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetchesour letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name) shallinquire for yours too and bring them to you. That will obviate alldifficulties you know; and from <i>us</i> I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation."</p><p>"You are extremely kind," said Jane; "but I cannot give up my earlywalk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walksomewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I havescarcely ever had a bad morning before."</p><p>"My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, thatis (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thingwithout the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flattermyself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If Imeet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point assettled."</p><p>"Excuse me," said Jane earnestly, "I cannot by any means consent tosuch an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If theerrand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always iswhen I am not here, by my grandmama's."</p><p>"Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to employ our men."</p><p>Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.</p><p>"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!" said she.-- "Theregularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!"</p><p>"It is certainly very well regulated."</p><p>"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that aletter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about thekingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million, I suppose,actually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of badhands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder."</p><p>"The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with somequickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you wantany farther explanation," continued he, smiling, "they are paid for it.That is the key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and mustbe served well."</p><p>The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual observations made.</p><p>"I have heard it asserted," said John Knightley, "that the same sortof handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same masterteaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imaginethe likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys havevery little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any handthey can get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. Ihave not always known their writing apart."</p><p>"Yes," said his brother hesitatingly, "there is a likeness. I know what you mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest."</p><p>"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully," said Mr. Woodhouse; "andalways did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston"--with half a sigh and half asmile at her.</p><p>"I never saw any gentleman's handwriting"--Emma began, looking alsoat Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston wasattending to some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect,"Now, how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking hisname at once before all these people? Is it necessary for me to use anyroundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend-- your correspondent inYorkshire;--that would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No,I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress. I certainly getbetter and better.--Now for it."</p><p>Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--"Mr. Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw."</p><p>"I do not admire it," said Mr. Knightley. "It is too small-- wants strength. It is like a woman's writing."</p><p>This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated himagainst the base aspersion. "No, it by no means wanted strength-- itwas not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs.Weston any letter about her to produce?" No, she had heard from himvery lately, but having answered the letter, had put it away.</p><p>"If we were in the other room," said Emma, "if I had mywriting-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note ofhis.-- Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for youone day?"</p><p>"He chose to say he was employed"--</p><p>"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley."</p><p>"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill," said Mr.Knightley dryly, "writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will,of course, put forth his best."</p><p>Dinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, wasready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to beallowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--</p><p>"Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way."</p><p>Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escapedEmma. She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to knowwhether the wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspectedthat it <i>had</i>; that it would not have been so resolutelyencountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear,and that it had not been in vain. She thought there was an air ofgreater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits.</p><p>She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and theexpense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end-- but sheabstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that shouldhurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies out ofthe room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becomingto the beauty and grace of each.</p></span><span id = 218 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emmafound it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinctparties;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill didMrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Westonwere obliged to be almost always either talking together or silenttogether. Mrs. Elton left them no choice. If Jane repressed her for alittle time, she soon began again; and though much that passed betweenthem was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there wasno avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: Thepost-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship, were longunder discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must be at leastequally unpleasant to Jane--inquiries whether she had yet heard of anysituation likely to suit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditatedactivity.</p><p>"Here is April come!" said she, "I get quite anxious about you. June will soon be here."</p><p>"But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked forward to the summer in general."</p><p>"But have you really heard of nothing?"</p><p>"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet."</p><p>"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing."</p><p>"I not aware!" said Jane, shaking her head; "dear Mrs. Elton, who can have thought of it as I have done?"</p><p>"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know how many candidates there always are for the <i>first</i>situations. I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round MapleGrove. A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity ofapplications; every body was anxious to be in her family, for she movesin the first circle. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine howdesirable! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one Iwould most wish to see you in."</p><p>"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,"said Jane. "I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will wantit;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But Iwould not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries atpresent."</p><p>"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving metrouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly bemore interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge ina day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-outfor any thing eligible."</p><p>"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject toher; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any bodytrouble."</p><p>"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, andJune, or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplishbefore us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as youdeserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everydayoccurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, wemust begin inquiring directly."</p><p>"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make noinquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid ofbeing long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquirywould soon produce something--Offices for the sale-- not quite of humanflesh--but of human intellect."</p><p>"Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a flingat the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather afriend to the abolition."</p><p>"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade," repliedJane; "governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on;but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where itlies. But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices, andthat by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meetingwith something that would do."</p><p>"Something that would do!" repeated Mrs. Elton. "Aye, <i>that</i>may suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creatureyou are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking upwith any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, ina family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command theelegancies of life."</p><p>"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, Ithink, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for."</p><p>"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but Ishall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will bequite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to movein the first circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you toname your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in thefamily as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know-- if you knew theharp, you might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well asplay;--yes, I really believe you might, even without the harp,stipulate for what you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully,honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have anyrest."</p><p>"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of sucha situation together," said Jane, "they are pretty sure to be equal;however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted atpresent for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I amobliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishingnothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer Ishall remain where I am, and as I am."</p><p>"And I am quite serious too, I assure you," replied Mrs. Eltongaily, "in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing myfriends to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us."</p><p>In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing tillMr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change ofobject, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,</p><p>"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think ofhis gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dearcreature he is;--I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all thatquaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste thanmodern ease; modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr.Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutelyjealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown.How do you like it?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I do notknow whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to theidea of being over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery. I must put on afew ornaments now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know,must appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; asimple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I amquite in the minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicityof dress,--show and finery are every thing. I have some notion ofputting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do youthink it will look well?"</p><p>The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room whenMr. Weston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a latedinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been toomuch expected by the best judges, for surprize-- but there was greatjoy. Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would havebeen sorry to see him before. John Knightley only was in muteastonishment.--That a man who might have spent his evening quietly athome after a day of business in London, should set off again, and walkhalf a mile to another man's house, for the sake of being in mixedcompany till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civilityand the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. Aman who had been in motion since eight o'clock in the morning, andmight now have been still, who had been long talking, and might havebeen silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have beenalone!--Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of hisown fireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush outagain into the world!--Could he by a touch of his finger have instantlytaken back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his comingwould probably prolong rather than break up the party. John Knightleylooked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said, "Icould not have believed it even of <i>him</i>."</p><p>Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation hewas exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right ofbeing principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers,was making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied theinquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of allher careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spreadabroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a familycommunication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, hehad not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body inthe room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; hehad met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.</p><p>"Read it, read it," said he, "it will give you pleasure; only a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma."</p><p>The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling andtalking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but veryaudible to every body.</p><p>"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do yousay to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon, did notI?--Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would notbelieve me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say; for<i>she</i> is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is tobe done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As toher illness, all nothing of course. But it is an excellent thing tohave Frank among us again, so near as town. They will stay a good whilewhen they do come, and he will be half his time with us. This isprecisely what I wanted. Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have youfinished it? Has Emma read it all? Put it up, put it up; we will have agood talk about it some other time, but it will not do now. I shallonly just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way."</p><p>Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looksand words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she washappy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warmand open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. <i>She</i> was alittle occupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understandthe degree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.</p><p>Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, toocommunicative to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with whatshe did say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happyby a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheardalready.</p><p>It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he mightnot have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularlydelighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, tobe made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, butshe was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would havebeen too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.Elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on thesubject with her.</p></span><span id = 220 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you," said Mr. Weston.</p><p>Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.</p><p>"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume," hecontinued-- "and know him to be my son, though he does not bear myname."</p><p>"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sureMr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both havegreat pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage."</p><p>"You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in aletter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing myson's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed to me--itwas to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. Ihardly ever get a letter."</p><p>"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.Weston-- (laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A mostdangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighboursfollow your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, wemarried women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh! Mr. Weston, I couldnot have believed it of you!"</p><p>"Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in a hurry,merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all coming up totown directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she has not been well thewhole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her-- so they are all tomove southward without loss of time."</p><p>"Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?"</p><p>"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London. a considerable journey."</p><p>"Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther thanfrom Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to peopleof large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me-- but twicein one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with fourhorses."</p><p>"The evil of the distance from Enscombe," said Mr. Weston, "is, that Mrs. Churchill, <i>as</i> <i>we</i> <i>understand</i>,has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together. In Frank'slast letter she complained, he said, of being too weak to get into herconservatory without having both his arm and his uncle's! This, youknow, speaks a great degree of weakness--but now she is so impatient tobe in town, that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.--SoFrank writes word. Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinaryconstitutions, Mrs. Elton. You must grant me that."</p><p>"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I Always take the part of myown sex. I do indeed. I give you notice--You will find me a formidableantagonist on that point. I always stand up for women-- and I assureyou, if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn,you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions toavoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her--and I believe I havecaught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;an excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?"</p><p>"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other finelady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in theland for"--</p><p>Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,</p><p>"Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure you. Do not run away with such an idea."</p><p>"Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld."</p><p>Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming sowarmly. It was by no means her object to have it believed that hersister was <i>not</i> a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit inthe pretence of it;--and she was considering in what way she had bestretract, when Mr. Weston went on.</p><p>"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--but this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, andtherefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of healthnow; but <i>that</i> indeed, by her own account, she has always been.I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faithin Mrs. Churchill's illness."</p><p>"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath, orto Clifton?" "She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too coldfor her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She hasnow been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, andshe begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, butvery retired."</p><p>"Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retiredfrom the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all roundit! You seem shut out from every thing--in the most completeretirement.-- And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spiritslike Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may nothave resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life. Ialways say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel verythankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent ofsociety."</p><p>"Frank was here in February for a fortnight."</p><p>"So I remember to have heard. He will find an <i>addition</i> to thesociety of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume tocall myself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of therebeing such a creature in the world."</p><p>This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,</p><p>"My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thingpossible. Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's letters latelyhave been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton."</p><p>He had done his duty and could return to his son.</p><p>"When Frank left us," continued he, "it was quite uncertain when wemight see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It hasbeen completely unexpected. That is, <i>I</i> always had a strongpersuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something favourablewould turn up--but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were bothdreadfully desponding. `How could he contrive to come? And how could itbe supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?' and soforth--I always felt that something would happen in our favour; and soit has, you see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life,that if things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mendthe next."</p><p>"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used tosay to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when,because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all therapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, andexclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be <i>May</i> beforeHymen's saffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have beenat to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! Thecarriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning, Iremember, he came to me quite in despair."</p><p>She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on.</p><p>"You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchillis ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place thanEnscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeableprospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring-- precisely theseason of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost atthe longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, andnever too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the bestof it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; therealways is in February, you know, and we could not do half that weintended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and Ido not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, thesort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day orto-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness thanhaving him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is thestate of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will bepleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generallythought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston'spartiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, mostgratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him."</p><p>"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that myopinion will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praiseof Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe, that Iam one of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no meansimplicitly guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son,so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer."</p><p>Mr. Weston was musing.</p><p>"I hope," said he presently, "I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; butthere are some traits in her character which make it difficult for meto speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot beignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of thetreatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame ofit is to be laid to her. She was the instigator. Frank's mother wouldnever have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill haspride; but his pride is nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet,indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and onlymake himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arroganceand insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fairpretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barelythe daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into aChurchill she has out-Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims:but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart."</p><p>"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite ahorror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust topeople of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood whoare such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they givethemselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of themdirectly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, andencumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immenseairs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old establishedfamilies. A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have livedat West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They camefrom Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr.Weston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there issomething direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known ofthe Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; andyet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to mybrother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearestneighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been elevenyears a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him--Ibelieve, at least--I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completedthe purchase before his death."</p><p>They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston,having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walkingaway.</p><p>After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemedlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, whichnobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry ofspirits which would have made her prefer being silent.</p><p>Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--</p><p>"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about theboys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down atfull length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concisethan her's, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I haveto recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physicthem."</p><p>"I rather hope to satisfy you both," said Emma, "for I shall do allin my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; andhappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic."</p><p>"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again."</p><p>"That is very likely. You think so, do not you?"</p><p>"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father-- oreven may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagementscontinue to increase as much as they have done lately."</p><p>"Increase!"</p><p>"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a great difference in your way of life."</p><p>"Difference! No indeed I am not."</p><p>"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with companythan you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down foronly one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!-- When did ithappen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing,and you mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabellabrought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or ballsat the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes inyour goings-on, is very great."</p><p>"Yes," said his brother quickly, "it is Randalls that does it all."</p><p>"Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have lessinfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, Ionly beg you to send them home."</p><p>"No," cried Mr. Knightley, "that need not be the consequence. Let them be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure."</p><p>"Upon my word," exclaimed Emma, "you amuse me! I should like to knowhow many of all my numerous engagements take place without your beingof the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisureto attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine-- whathave they been? Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball talkedof, which never took place. I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. JohnKnightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friendsat once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you,(turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am evertwo hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series ofdissipation for me, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, Imust say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think theywould fare much better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from homeabout five hours where she is absent one-- and who, when he is at home,is either reading to himself or settling his accounts."</p><p>Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.</p></span><span id = 227 ></span><span id = 230 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to thenature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. Shewas soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at allapprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment hadreally subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love ofthe two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment whichhe had taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of twomonths should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils beforeher:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did notmean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would beincumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.</p><p>She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolutedeclaration. That would be so very painful a conclusion of theirpresent acquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipatingsomething decisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass withoutbringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composedand tranquil state.</p><p>It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston hadforeseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of FrankChurchill's feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite sosoon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.He rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as hecame from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exerciseall her quick observation, and speedily determine how he wasinfluenced, and how she must act. They met with the utmostfriendliness. There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeingher. But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as hehad done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree. Shewatched him well. It was a clear thing he was less in love than he hadbeen. Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference, hadproduced this very natural and very desirable effect.</p><p>He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, andseemed delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to oldstories: and he was not without agitation. It was not in his calmnessthat she read his comparative difference. He was not calm; his spiritswere evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively ashe was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but whatdecided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of anhour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury. "He had seen agroup of old acquaintance in the street as he passed-- he had notstopped, he would not stop for more than a word--but he had the vanityto think they would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as hewished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off." She had nodoubt as to his being less in love--but neither his agitated spirits,nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was ratherinclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and adiscreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.</p><p>This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of tendays. He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented.His aunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own accountat Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, itwas to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been ofno service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she wasreally ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it,at Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when helooked back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had beenhalf a year ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing thatcare and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not havemany years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on,by all his father's doubts, to say that her complaints were merelyimaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.</p><p>It soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She couldnot endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation andsuffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to Randallscommunicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately toRichmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill ofan eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. Aready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefitexpected from the change.</p><p>Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of thisarrangement, and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of havingtwo months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for the house was taken for May and June. She was told that now hewrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost asoften as he could even wish.</p><p>Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He wasconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. Shehoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.</p><p>Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted.It was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would bereally having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to ayoung man?--An hour's ride. He would be always coming over. Thedifference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to makethe whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteenmiles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen toManchester-street--was a serious obstacle. Were he ever able to getaway, the day would be spent in coming and returning. There was nocomfort in having him in London; he might as well be at Enscombe; butRichmond was the very distance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!</p><p>One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by thisremoval,-- the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, butit had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, andvery soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few linesfrom Frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for thechange, and that he had no doubt of being able to join them fortwenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early aday as possible.</p><p>Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil tohim. May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates wasengaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and hesanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little Johnwould have any thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.</p></span><span id = 232 ><p><br clear="&quot;&quot;all&quot;&quot;" /></p><p>No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The dayapproached, the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxiouswatching, Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self,reached Randalls before dinner, and every thing was safe.</p><p>No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The roomat the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a commonmeeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in hisentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfortof the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refusehim, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man'scompany. She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in goodtime, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.</p><p>Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he didnot say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightfulevening. They all walked about together, to see that every thing was asit should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents ofanother carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first,without great surprize. "So unreasonably early!" she was going toexclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends,who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr.Weston's judgment; and they were so very closely followed by anothercarriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the samedistinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as ifhalf the company might soon be collected together for the purpose ofpreparatory inspection.</p><p>Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr.Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of aman who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very firstdistinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but alittle less of open-heartedness would have made him a highercharacter.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a manwhat he ought to be.-- She could fancy such a man. The whole partywalked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothingelse to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe intheir various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though <i>May</i>, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.</p><p>Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number ofprivy councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates'sdoor to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were tobe brought by the Eltons.</p><p>Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was arestlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, hewas going to the door, he was watching for the sound of othercarriages,-- impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.</p><p>Mrs. Elton was spoken of. "I think she must be here soon," said he."I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much ofher. It cannot be long, I think, before she comes."</p><p>A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back, said,</p><p>"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have neverseen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myselfforward."</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.</p><p>"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking about. "We thought you were to bring them."</p><p>The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now.Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be;how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and hersmiles of graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to forman opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the introductionhad passed.</p><p>In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir," said Frank to his father:"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:" and away he went. Mr. Weston wasfollowing; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinionof his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.</p><p>"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly toldyou I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I amextremely pleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. Ithink him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely whatI like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceitor puppyism. You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies-- quite ahorror of them. They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr.Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimesto say very cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, borewith them much better."</p><p>While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; butwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladiesjust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.</p><p>Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. "I have no doubt of its being ourcarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are soextremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.-- Whata pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!-- I understandyou were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quiteunnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of <i>them</i>."</p><p>Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walkedinto the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty asMrs. Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might beunderstood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, everybody's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates,who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutesafter her being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the dooropened she was heard,</p><p>"So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I donot care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares-- Well!--(assoon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!--Thisis admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting.Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!-- Jane, Jane,look!--did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really havehad Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again.I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance. `Oh! Mrs.Stokes,' said I-- but I had not time for more." She was now met by Mrs.Weston.-- "Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well.Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headache!-- seeingyou pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you forthe carriage!--excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep thehorses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.-- Oh! and I am sure ourthanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had mostkindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.-- But two such offersin one day!--Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, `Upon myword, ma'am--.' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr.Woodhouse's. I made her take her shawl--for the evenings are notwarm--her large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind ofher to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon'schoice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated aboutsome time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane,are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, butI am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely-- and therewas a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his extremepoliteness.--Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother'sspectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came outagain. My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she,Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?-- Ah! here's MissWoodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?-- Very well I thankyou, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!-- Such atransformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma mostcomplacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.-- She didit all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her hair!-- No hairdresserfrom London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare-- and Mrs. Hughes.Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How do you do?How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is notit?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?-- Oh! there he is. Don't disturb him.Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do you do, Mr.Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town--Mrs.Otway, I protest!-- and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and MissCaroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--Howdo you do? How do you all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you.Never better.-- Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--verylikely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standingabout among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted.No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea if youplease, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes. Every thing sogood!"</p><p>Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as MissBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing thediscourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a littleway behind her.--He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too,she could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on herdress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Eltonwas evidently wanting to be complimented herself-- and it was, "How doyou like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?-- How has Wright donemy hair?"--with many other relative questions, all answered withpatient politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, "Nobody can think less ofdress in general than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, whenevery body's eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to theWestons--who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do mehonour--I would not wish to be inferior to others. And I see very fewpearls in the room except mine.-- So Frank Churchill is a capitaldancer, I understand.--We shall see if our styles suit.--A fine youngman certainly is Frank Churchill. I like him very well."</p><p>At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma couldnot but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want tohear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, tillanother suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctlyforward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,</p><p>"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?-- Iwas this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatientfor tidings of us."</p><p>"Jane!"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize anddispleasure.-- "That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it,I suppose."</p><p>"How do you like Mrs. Elton?" said Emma in a whisper.</p><p>"Not at all."</p><p>"You are ungrateful."</p><p>"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?" Then changing from a frown to asmile--"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?"</p><p>Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. Hewalked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr.and Mrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, whichmust be laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs.Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; whichinterfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emmaheard the sad truth with fortitude.</p><p>"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?" said Mr. Weston. "She will think Frank ought to ask her."</p><p>Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; andboasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his mostperfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston waswanting <i>him</i> to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that theirbusiness was to help to persuade him into it, which was done prettysoon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill andMiss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs.Elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton hadundoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completelygratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill,she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be his son'ssuperior.-- In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling withenjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it wasforming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivitybefore her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancingthan by any thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where heought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with thehusbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feelan interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young ashe looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhapsanywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall, firm, uprightfigure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderlymen, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, exceptingher own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men whocould be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer, and those fewsteps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with whatnatural grace, he must have danced, would he but take thetrouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but ingeneral he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroombetter, and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed oftenobserving her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of herdancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feelafraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That FrankChurchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.</p><p>The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessantattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemedhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldombestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given inthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, veryrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetingsusually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought somethingof.--The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had nopartner;--the only young lady sitting down;-- and so equal had beenhitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any onedisengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards,on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to danceif it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not--and shewas expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.</p><p>Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the roomwhere the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about infront of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution ofmaintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before MissSmith, or speaking to those who were close to her.-- Emma saw it. Shewas not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, andhad therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head alittle she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the wholegroup were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyesto watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of adialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; andshe perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her,was not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significantglances.--The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat tojoin him and say, "Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?" to which his promptreply was, "Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."</p><p>"Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no dancer."</p><p>"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance," said he, "I shall have greatpleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an oldmarried man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me verygreat pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.Gilbert."</p><p>"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young ladydisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.""Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over,Mrs. Weston. You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happyto do, at your command--but my dancing days are over."</p><p>Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprizeand mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr.Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.-- She looked round fora moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and wasarranging himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high gleepassed between him and his wife.</p><p>She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her face might be as hot.</p><p>In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley leadingHarriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized, seldom moredelighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and thoughtoo distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she couldcatch his eye again.</p><p>His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremelygood; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had notbeen for the cruel state of things before, and for the very completeenjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happyfeatures announced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higherthan ever, flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual courseof smiles.</p><p>Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted)very foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife,though growing very like her;--<i>she</i> spoke some of her feelings, by observing audibly to her partner,</p><p>"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured, I declare."</p><p>Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heardfrom that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at tableand taking up her spoon.</p><p>"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. Mrs.Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid therewill be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--Onedoor nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed you must.Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!--sogratified! Excellent dancing indeed!-- Yes, my dear, I ran home, as Isaid I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobodymissed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, avast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuitsand baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some ofher throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you wereamused, and who were your partners. `Oh!' said I, `I shall notforestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will loveto tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr.Elton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.'My dear sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would notrather?--I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Janeon one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a littleback, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant shelooks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train. Quite thequeen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps,Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I waspersuaded there were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two,and there is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort andstyle--Candles everywhere.--I was telling you of your grandmama,Jane,--There was a little disappointment.-- The baked apples andbiscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicatefricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, andgood Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough,sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better thansweetbread and asparagus-- so she was rather disappointed, but weagreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its gettinground to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very muchconcerned!--Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not havesupposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothinglike it since-- Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere,so that Jane is not in a draught. Where <i>I</i> sit is of noconsequence. Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr.Churchill-- only it seems too good--but just as you please. What youdirect in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we everrecollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I shouldnot be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot helpbeginning."</p><p>Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till aftersupper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invitedhim irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in hisreprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.</p><p>"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet," said he. "Emma, why is it that they are your enemies?"</p><p>He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added, "<i>She</i>ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may be.--To thatsurmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you didwant him to marry Harriet."</p><p>"I did," replied Emma, "and they cannot forgive me."</p><p>He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he only said,</p><p>"I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections."</p><p>"Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong?"</p><p>"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."</p><p>"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I didnot: and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. Itwas through a series of strange blunders!"</p><p>"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you thejustice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he haschosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, whichMrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artlessgirl-- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to sucha woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than Iexpected."</p><p>Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.</p><p>"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you alldoing?-- Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body islazy! Every body is asleep!"</p><p>"I am ready," said Emma, "whenever I am wanted."</p><p>"Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley.</p><p>She hesitated a moment, and then replied, "With you, if you will ask me."</p><p>"Will you?" said he, offering his hand.</p><p>"Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know weare not really so much brother and sister as to make it at allimproper."</p><p>"Brother and sister! no, indeed."</p></span><span id = 235 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The dayapproached, the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxiouswatching, Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self,reached Randalls before dinner, and every thing was safe.</p><p>No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The roomat the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a commonmeeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in hisentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfortof the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refusehim, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man'scompany. She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in goodtime, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.</p><p>Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he didnot say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightfulevening. They all walked about together, to see that every thing was asit should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents ofanother carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first,without great surprize. "So unreasonably early!" she was going toexclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends,who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr.Weston's judgment; and they were so very closely followed by anothercarriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the samedistinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as ifhalf the company might soon be collected together for the purpose ofpreparatory inspection.</p><p>Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr.Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of aman who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very firstdistinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but alittle less of open-heartedness would have made him a highercharacter.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a manwhat he ought to be.-- She could fancy such a man. The whole partywalked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothingelse to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe intheir various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though <i>May</i>, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.</p><p>Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number ofprivy councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates'sdoor to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were tobe brought by the Eltons.</p><p>Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was arestlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, hewas going to the door, he was watching for the sound of othercarriages,-- impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.</p><p>Mrs. Elton was spoken of. "I think she must be here soon," said he."I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much ofher. It cannot be long, I think, before she comes."</p><p>A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back, said,</p><p>"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have neverseen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myselfforward."</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.</p><p>"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking about. "We thought you were to bring them."</p><p>The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now.Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be;how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and hersmiles of graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to forman opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the introductionhad passed.</p><p>In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir," said Frank to his father:"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:" and away he went. Mr. Weston wasfollowing; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinionof his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.</p><p>"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly toldyou I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I amextremely pleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. Ithink him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely whatI like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceitor puppyism. You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies-- quite ahorror of them. They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr.Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimesto say very cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, borewith them much better."</p><p>While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; butwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladiesjust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.</p><p>Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. "I have no doubt of its being ourcarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are soextremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.-- Whata pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!-- I understandyou were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quiteunnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of <i>them</i>."</p><p>Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walkedinto the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty asMrs. Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might beunderstood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, everybody's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates,who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutesafter her being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the dooropened she was heard,</p><p>"So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I donot care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares-- Well!--(assoon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!--Thisis admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting.Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!-- Jane, Jane,look!--did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really havehad Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again.I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance. `Oh! Mrs.Stokes,' said I-- but I had not time for more." She was now met by Mrs.Weston.-- "Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well.Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headache!-- seeingyou pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you forthe carriage!--excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep thehorses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.-- Oh! and I am sure ourthanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had mostkindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.-- But two such offersin one day!--Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, `Upon myword, ma'am--.' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr.Woodhouse's. I made her take her shawl--for the evenings are notwarm--her large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind ofher to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon'schoice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated aboutsome time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane,are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, butI am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely-- and therewas a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his extremepoliteness.--Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother'sspectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came outagain. My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she,Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?-- Ah! here's MissWoodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?-- Very well I thankyou, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!-- Such atransformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma mostcomplacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.-- She didit all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her hair!-- No hairdresserfrom London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare-- and Mrs. Hughes.Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How do you do?How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is notit?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?-- Oh! there he is. Don't disturb him.Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do you do, Mr.Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town--Mrs.Otway, I protest!-- and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and MissCaroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--Howdo you do? How do you all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you.Never better.-- Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--verylikely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standingabout among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted.No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea if youplease, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes. Every thing sogood!"</p><p>Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as MissBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing thediscourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a littleway behind her.--He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too,she could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on herdress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Eltonwas evidently wanting to be complimented herself-- and it was, "How doyou like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?-- How has Wright donemy hair?"--with many other relative questions, all answered withpatient politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, "Nobody can think less ofdress in general than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, whenevery body's eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to theWestons--who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do mehonour--I would not wish to be inferior to others. And I see very fewpearls in the room except mine.-- So Frank Churchill is a capitaldancer, I understand.--We shall see if our styles suit.--A fine youngman certainly is Frank Churchill. I like him very well."</p><p>At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma couldnot but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want tohear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, tillanother suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctlyforward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,</p><p>"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?-- Iwas this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatientfor tidings of us."</p><p>"Jane!"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize anddispleasure.-- "That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it,I suppose."</p><p>"How do you like Mrs. Elton?" said Emma in a whisper.</p><p>"Not at all."</p><p>"You are ungrateful."</p><p>"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?" Then changing from a frown to asmile--"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?"</p><p>Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. Hewalked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr.and Mrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, whichmust be laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs.Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; whichinterfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emmaheard the sad truth with fortitude.</p><p>"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?" said Mr. Weston. "She will think Frank ought to ask her."</p><p>Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; andboasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his mostperfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston waswanting <i>him</i> to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that theirbusiness was to help to persuade him into it, which was done prettysoon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill andMiss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs.Elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton hadundoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completelygratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill,she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be his son'ssuperior.-- In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling withenjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it wasforming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivitybefore her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancingthan by any thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where heought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with thehusbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feelan interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young ashe looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhapsanywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall, firm, uprightfigure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderlymen, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, exceptingher own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men whocould be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer, and those fewsteps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with whatnatural grace, he must have danced, would he but take thetrouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but ingeneral he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroombetter, and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed oftenobserving her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of herdancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feelafraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That FrankChurchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.</p><p>The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessantattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemedhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldombestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given inthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, veryrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetingsusually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought somethingof.--The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had nopartner;--the only young lady sitting down;-- and so equal had beenhitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any onedisengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards,on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to danceif it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not--and shewas expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.</p><p>Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the roomwhere the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about infront of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution ofmaintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before MissSmith, or speaking to those who were close to her.-- Emma saw it. Shewas not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, andhad therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head alittle she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the wholegroup were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyesto watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of adialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; andshe perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her,was not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significantglances.--The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat tojoin him and say, "Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?" to which his promptreply was, "Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."</p><p>"Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no dancer."</p><p>"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance," said he, "I shall have greatpleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an oldmarried man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me verygreat pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.Gilbert."</p><p>"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young ladydisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.""Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over,Mrs. Weston. You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happyto do, at your command--but my dancing days are over."</p><p>Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprizeand mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr.Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.-- She looked round fora moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and wasarranging himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high gleepassed between him and his wife.</p><p>She would not look again.

The move began; and Miss Bates might be heardfrom that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at tableand taking up her spoon.</p><p>"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet.

An unpretending, single-minded, artlessgirl-- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to sucha woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than Iexpected."</p><p>Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.</p><p>"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you alldoing?-- Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body islazy! Every body is asleep!"</p><p>"I am ready," said Emma, "whenever I am wanted."</p><p>"Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley.</p><p>She hesitated a moment, and then replied, "With you, if you will ask me."</p><p>"Will you?" said he, offering his hand.</p><p>"Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know weare not really so much brother and sister as to make it at allimproper."</p><p>"Brother and sister! no, indeed."</p></span><span id = 237 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet cameone morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sittingdown and hesitating, thus began:</p><p>"Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that Ishould like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then, youknow, it will be over."</p><p>Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was aseriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite as much asher words, for something more than ordinary.</p><p>"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish," she continued, "tohave no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite analtered creature in <i>one</i> <i>respect</i>, it is very fit that youshould have the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say morethan is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I havedone, and I dare say you understand me."</p><p>"Yes," said Emma, "I hope I do."</p><p>"How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . ." criedHarriet, warmly. "It seems like madness! I can see nothing at allextraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet him ornot--except that of the two I had rather not see him-- and indeed Iwould go any distance round to avoid him--but I do not envy his wife inthe least; I neither admire her nor envy her, as I have done: she isvery charming, I dare say, and all that, but I think her veryill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall never forget her look the othernight!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, I wish her no evil.--No,let them be ever so happy together, it will not give me anothermoment's pang: and to convince you that I have been speaking truth, Iam now going to destroy--what I ought to have destroyed long ago--whatI ought never to have kept-- I know that very well (blushing as shespoke).--However, now I will destroy it all--and it is my particularwish to do it in your presence, that you may see how rational I amgrown. Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?" said she, with aconscious look.</p><p>"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?"</p><p>"No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued very much."</p><p>She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words <i>Most</i> <i>precious</i> <i>treasures</i>on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited. Harriet unfolded theparcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within abundance of silverpaper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet opened: itwas well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the cotton, Emmasaw only a small piece of court-plaister.</p><p>"Now," said Harriet, "you <i>must</i> recollect."</p><p>"No, indeed I do not."</p><p>"Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forgetwhat passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the verylast times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I hadmy sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came-- I thinkthe very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with yournew penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?-- But, as you hadnone about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so Itook mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large,and he cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left,before he gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could nothelp making a treasure of it-- so I put it by never to be used, andlooked at it now and then as a great treat."</p><p>"My dearest Harriet!" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,and jumping up, "you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving thisrelic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting thefinger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none aboutme!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in mypocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continualblush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)-- goon--what else?"</p><p>"And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally."</p><p>"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for hissake!" said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feelingdivided between wonder and amusement. And secretly she added toherself, "Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting byin cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had beenpulling about! I never was equal to this."</p><p>"Here," resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, "here is something still more valuable, I mean that <i>has</i> <i>been</i> more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister never did."</p><p>Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an old pencil,--the part without any lead.</p><p>"This was really his," said Harriet.--"Do not you remember onemorning?--no, I dare say you do not. But one morning--I forget exactlythe day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before <i>that</i> <i>evening</i>,he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was aboutspruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewingspruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out hispencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and itwould not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the tableas good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared,caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment."</p><p>"I do remember it," cried Emma; "I perfectly remember it.-- Talkingabout spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we likedit, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too. Iperfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, wasnot he? I have an idea he was standing just here."</p><p>"Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but Icannot recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much aboutwhere I am now."--</p><p>"Well, go on."</p><p>"Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say-- exceptthat I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish youto see me do it."</p><p>"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?"</p><p>"Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, andwish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong ofme, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew itwas--but had not resolution enough to part with them."</p><p>"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I havenot a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaistermight be useful."</p><p>"I shall be happier to burn it," replied Harriet. "It has adisagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.-- There itgoes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton."</p><p>"And when," thought Emma, "will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?"</p><p>She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning wasalready made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had <i>told</i>no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnightafter the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quiteundesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made theinformation she received more valuable. She merely said, in the courseof some trivial chat, "Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would adviseyou to do so and so"--and thought no more of it, till after a minute'ssilence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, "I shall nevermarry."</p><p>Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after amoment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,</p><p>"Never marry!--This is a new resolution."</p><p>"It is one that I shall never change, however."</p><p>After another short hesitation, "I hope it does not proceed from-- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?"</p><p>"Mr. Elton indeed!" cried Harriet indignantly.--"Oh! no"--and Emma could just catch the words, "so superior to Mr. Elton!"</p><p>She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed nofarther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps ifshe were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her tohear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as hadbeen, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, shewas perfectly resolved.-- She believed it would be wiser for her to sayand know at once, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing wasalways best. She had previously determined how far she would proceed,on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to havethe judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.-- She wasdecided, and thus spoke--</p><p>"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Yourresolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results froman idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatlyyour superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?"</p><p>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption tosuppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admirehim at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all therest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, whichare so proper, in me especially."</p><p>"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart."</p><p>"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!-- The veryrecollection of it, and all that I felt at the time-- when I saw himcoming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before. Such a change! Inone moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!"</p><p>"It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.-- Yes,honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.-- But that itwill be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise. I do notadvise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage forits being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will bewisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do notlet them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Beobservant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. Igive you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again onthe subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward Iknow nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We werevery wrong before; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, nodoubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very seriousnature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, therehave been matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. Iwould not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assuredyour raising your thoughts to <i>him</i>, is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value."</p><p>Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma wasvery decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for herfriend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind-- and itmust be saving her from the danger of degradation.</p></span><span id = 239 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June openedupon Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change.The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of theuse to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still ather grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland wasagain delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she waslikely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least shewere able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her service, and saveherself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will.</p><p>Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, hadcertainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growingto dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing inhis pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, hismother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct,discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But while so manywere devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet,Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle withJane Fairfax. He could not understand it; but there were symptoms ofintelligence between them--he thought so at least-- symptoms ofadmiration on his side, which, having once observed, he could notpersuade himself to think entirely void of meaning, however he mightwish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination. <i>She</i> was notpresent when the suspicion first arose. He was dining with the Randallsfamily, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he had seen a look, more than asingle look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of MissWoodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he was again in theircompany, he could not help remembering what he had seen; nor could heavoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and his fire attwilight,</p><p>"Myself creating what I saw,"</p><p>brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something ofprivate liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchilland Jane.</p><p>He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, tospend his evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; hejoined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who,like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as theweather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Batesand her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, onreaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort ofvisiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go inand drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately;and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few personslistened to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse'smost obliging invitation.</p><p>As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback. The gentlemen spoke of his horse.</p><p>"By the bye," said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, "what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?"</p><p>Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, "I did not know that he ever had any such plan."</p><p>"Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago."</p><p>"Me! impossible!"</p><p>"Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as whatwas certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and wasextremely happy about it. It was owing to <i>her</i> persuasion, as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You must remember it now?"</p><p>"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."</p><p>"Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must havedreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith, you walk as ifyou were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home."</p><p>"What is this?--What is this?" cried Mr. Weston, "about Perry and acarriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad hecan afford it. You had it from himself, had you?"</p><p>"No, sir," replied his son, laughing, "I seem to have had it fromnobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's havingmentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, withall these particulars--but as she declares she never heard a syllableof it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a greatdreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away-- and when Ihave gone through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr.and Mrs. Perry."</p><p>"It is odd though," observed his father, "that you should have hadsuch a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likelyyou should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his carriage!and his wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health-- justwhat will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a littlepremature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, yourdream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you areabsent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?"</p><p>Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests toprepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach ofMr. Weston's hint.</p><p>"Why, to own the truth," cried Miss Bates, who had been trying invain to be heard the last two minutes, "if I must speak on thissubject, there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I donot mean to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimesthe oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I mustacknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perryherself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well asourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and onlythought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he shouldhave a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morningbecause she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don't you remembergrandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we hadbeen walking to-- very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was toRandalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeedI do not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her inconfidence; she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but itwas not to go beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned itto a soul that I know of. At the same time, I will not positivelyanswer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimespop out a thing before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rathera talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I shouldnot. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it <i>she</i>never betrayed the least thing in the world. Where is she?--Oh! justbehind. Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming.-- Extraordinary dream,indeed!"</p><p>They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded MissBates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where hethought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he hadinvoluntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busywith her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemenwaited at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in FrankChurchill the determination of catching her eye-- he seemed watchingher intently--in vain, however, if it were so-- Jane passed betweenthem into the hall, and looked at neither.</p><p>There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream mustbe borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest roundthe large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,and which none but Emma could have had power to place there andpersuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, onwhich two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Teapassed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.</p><p>"Miss Woodhouse," said Frank Churchill, after examining a tablebehind him, which he could reach as he sat, "have your nephews takenaway their alphabets--their box of letters? It used to stand here.Where is it? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to betreated rather as winter than summer. We had great amusement with thoseletters one morning. I want to puzzle you again."</p><p>Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the tablewas quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so muchdisposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming wordsfor each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. Thequietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse,who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr.Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied inlamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the "poorlittle boys," or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letternear him, how beautifully Emma had written it.</p><p>Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slightglance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next toEmma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see themall; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as littleapparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smilepushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, andburied from sight, she should have looked on the table instead oflooking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager afterevery fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fellto work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.The word was <i>blunder</i>; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwiseostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it couldall be, was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretionof his favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there mustbe some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemedto meet him at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle forgallantry and trick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deepergame on Frank Churchill's part.</p><p>With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with greatalarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He sawa short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly anddemure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highlyentertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper toappear to censure; for she said, "Nonsense! for shame!" He heard FrankChurchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, "I will give it toher--shall I?"--and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eagerlaughing warmth. "No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed."</p><p>It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to lovewithout feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particulardegree of sedate civility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley'sexcessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seizeevery possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was notlong before he saw it to be <i>Dixon</i>. Jane Fairfax's perceptionseemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal tothe covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters soarranged. She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herselfwatched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and sayingonly, "I did not know that proper names were allowed," pushed away theletters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged byno other word that could be offered. Her face was averted from thosewho had made the attack, and turned towards her aunt.</p><p>"Aye, very true, my dear," cried the latter, though Jane had notspoken a word--"I was just going to say the same thing. It is time forus to be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will belooking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wishyou good night."</p><p>Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt hadpreconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table;but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr.Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushedtowards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She wasafterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--itwas growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted,Mr. Knightley could not tell.</p><p>He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full ofwhat he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist hisobservations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend-- an anxiousfriend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not seeher in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. Itwas his duty.</p><p>"Pray, Emma," said he, "may I ask in what lay the great amusement,the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? Isaw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so veryentertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other."</p><p>Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him thetrue explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed,she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.</p><p>"Oh!" she cried in evident embarrassment, "it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves."</p><p>"The joke," he replied gravely, "seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill."</p><p>He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She wouldrather busy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little whilein doubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference-- fruitlessinterference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemedto declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it toher, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcomeinterference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, ratherthan the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.</p><p>"My dear Emma," said he at last, with earnest kindness, "do youthink you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between thegentleman and lady we have been speaking of?"</p><p>"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.-- Why do you make a doubt of it?"</p><p>"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that she admired him?"</p><p>"Never, never!" she cried with a most open eagerness--"Never, forthe twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And howcould it possibly come into your head?"</p><p>"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment betweenthem-- certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to bepublic."</p><p>"Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you canvouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do-- verysorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will not do.There is no admiration between them, I do assure you; and theappearances which have caught you, have arisen from some peculiarcircumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature-- it isimpossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense init--but the part which is capable of being communicated, which issense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or admiration forone another, as any two beings in the world can be. That is, I <i>presume</i> it to be so on her side, and I can <i>answer</i> for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman's indifference."</p><p>She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfactionwhich silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would haveprolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of hissuspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of acircumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meethers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too muchirritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolutefever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almostevery evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hastyleave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.</p></span><span id = 241 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortificationof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No suchimportation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores atpresent. In the daily interchange of news, they must be againrestricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings'coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and thesituation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped mighteventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that ofall her neighbours was by the approach of it.</p><p>Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a greatdeal of pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations mustall wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So shethought at first;--but a little consideration convinced her that everything need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hillthough the Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with themin the autumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. Thatthere was to be such a party had been long generally known: it had evengiven the idea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wishedto see what every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr.Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two orthree more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and itwas to be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitelysuperior to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating anddrinking, and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.</p><p>This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could notbut feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr.Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother andsister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and gotogether; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so itwas to be, if she had no objection. Now, as her objection was nothingbut her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston mustalready be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forwardagain:--it could not be done without a reproof to him, which would begiving pain to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged toconsent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal toavoid; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to thedegradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton's party! Every feelingwas offended; and the forbearance of her outward submission left aheavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on theunmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.</p><p>"I am glad you approve of what I have done," said he verycomfortably. "But I thought you would. Such schemes as these arenothing without numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A largeparty secures its own amusement. And she is a good-natured woman afterall. One could not leave her out."</p><p>Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.</p><p>It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Eltonwas growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as topigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thinginto sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be venturedon, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources wereinadequate to such an attack.</p><p>"Is not this most vexations, Knightley?" she cried.--"And suchweather for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quiteodious. What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, andnothing done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had adelightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."</p><p>"You had better explore to Donwell," replied Mr. Knightley. "Thatmay be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They areripening fast."</p><p>If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceedso, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the "Oh! I shouldlike it of all things," was not plainer in words than manner. Donwellwas famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for theinvitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have beenenough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. Shepromised him again and again to come--much oftener than he doubted--andwas extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such adistinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.</p><p>"You may depend upon me," said she. "I certainly will come. Nameyour day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?"</p><p>"I cannot name a day," said he, "till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you."</p><p>"Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am LadyPatroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me."</p><p>"I hope you will bring Elton," said he: "but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations."</p><p>"Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider--you need not be afraid of delegating power to <i>me</i>.I am no young lady on her preferment. Married women, you know, may besafely authorised. It is my party. Leave it all to me. I will inviteyour guests."</p><p>"No,"--he calmly replied,--"there is but one married woman in theworld whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases toDonwell, and that one is--"</p><p>"--Mrs. Weston, I suppose," interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.</p><p>"No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage such matters myself."</p><p>"Ah! you are an odd creature!" she cried, satisfied to have no onepreferred to herself.--"You are a humourist, and may say what you like.Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me-- Jane and heraunt.--The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meetingthe Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are attached to them."</p><p>"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home."</p><p>"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like.It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simplething. I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little basketshanging on my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon.Nothing can be more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another.There is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party. We are to walkabout your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and situnder trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to beall out of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing asnatural and simple as possible. Is not that your idea?"</p><p>"Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to havethe table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity ofgentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think isbest observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eatingstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house."</p><p>"Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by thebye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray be sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, orto inspect anything--"</p><p>"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you."</p><p>"Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely clever."</p><p>"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and would spurn any body's assistance."</p><p>"I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come ondonkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by. Ireally must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life Iconceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever somany resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up athome;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and inwinter there is dirt."</p><p>"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. DonwellLane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey,however, if you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wishevery thing to be as much to your taste as possible."</p><p>"That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have thewarmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.-- Yes,believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me inthe whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to pleaseme."</p><p>Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join theparty; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doorsto eat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under thespecious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent atDonwell, be tempted away to his misery.</p><p>He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid himfor his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell fortwo years. "Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could govery well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the deargirls walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be dampnow, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old houseagain exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton,and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at allto his, and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning.He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them-- verykind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond ofdining out."</p><p>Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence.The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if,like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particularcompliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very highexpectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised toget Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation andgratitude which could have been dispensed with.-- Mr. Knightley wasthen obliged to say that he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Westonengaged to lose no time in writing, and spare no arguments to inducehim to come.</p><p>In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party toBox Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell wassettled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearingexactly right.</p><p>Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse wassafely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake ofthis al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in theAbbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he washappily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of whathad been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and notto heat themselves.-- Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there onpurpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when allthe others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener andsympathiser.</p><p>It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as shewas satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, andlook around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with moreparticular observation, more exact understanding of a house and groundswhich must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.</p><p>She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliancewith the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as sheviewed the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable,becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered-- its amplegardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which theAbbey, with all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--andits abundance of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion norextravagance had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, andtotally unlike it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling andirregular, with many comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--Itwas just what it ought to be, and it looked what it was--and Emma feltan increasing respect for it, as the residence of a family of such truegentility, untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temperJohn Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raisea blush. These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about andindulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, andcollect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled,excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet andher basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, ortalking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought orspoken of.--"The best fruit in England-- every body's favourite--alwayswholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful togather for one's self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morningdecidedly the best time--never tired-- every sort good--hautboyinfinitely superior--no comparison-- the others hardlyeatable--hautboys very scarce--Chili preferred-- white wood finestflavour of all--price of strawberries in London-- abundance aboutBristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardenersthinking exactly different--no general rule-- gardeners never to be putout of their way--delicious fruit-- only too rich to be eaten muchof--inferior to cherries-- currants more refreshing--only objection togathering strawberries the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--couldbear it no longer-- must go and sit in the shade."</p><p>Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only onceby Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law,to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.-- She had somefears of his horse.</p><p>Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged tooverhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.-- Asituation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton hadreceived notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was notwith Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity andsplendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs.Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks,every thing--and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed withimmediately.--On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and shepositively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfaxcontinued to assure her that she would not at present engage in anything, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urgebefore.-- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write anacquiescence by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, wasastonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--andat last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed aremoval.-- "Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them thegardens-- all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent."--Thepertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.</p><p>It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in ascattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensiblyfollowed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue oflimes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from theriver, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.-- It led to nothing;nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars,which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of anapproach to the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however,as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself acharming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.--Theconsiderable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood,gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half amile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, wellclothed with wood;-- and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placedand sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and theriver making a close and handsome curve around it.</p><p>It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, withoutbeing oppressive.</p><p>In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; andtowards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harrietdistinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley andHarriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.--Therehad been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, andturned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasantconversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have beensorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm;but now she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all itsappendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreadingflocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.--Shejoined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than inlooking around. He was giving Harriet information as to modes ofagriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, "Theseare my own concerns. I have a right to talk on such subjects, withoutbeing suspected of introducing Robert Martin."--She did not suspecthim. It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased tothink of Harriet.--They took a few turns together along the walk.--Theshade was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part ofthe day.</p><p>The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;-- andthey were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come.Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not ownhimself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured ofwishing that he would part with his black mare. He had expressedhimself as to coming, with more than common certainty. "His aunt was somuch better, that he had not a doubt of getting over to them."--Mrs.Churchill's state, however, as many were ready to remind her, wasliable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in themost reasonable dependence--and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded tobelieve, or to say, that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchillthat he was prevented coming.-- Emma looked at Harriet while the pointwas under consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.</p><p>The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more tosee what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps getas far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or,at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing coolagain.--Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in thehighest part of the gardens, where no damps from the river wereimagined even by him, stirred no more; and his daughter resolved toremain with him, that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by herhusband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need.</p><p>Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse'sentertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had beenprepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and thekindness had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedinglywell amused. Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now hewould shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblanceto a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he wasslow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking over wasbegun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a fewmoments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of thehouse--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quicklyin from the garden, and with a look of escape.-- Little expecting tomeet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but MissWoodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.</p><p>"Will you be so kind," said she, "when I am missed, as to say that Iam gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how lateit is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we shall bewanted, and I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing aboutit to any body. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some aregone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in Ishall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness tosay that I am gone?"</p><p>"Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone?"</p><p>"Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty minutes."</p><p>"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let myfather's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage. It can beround in five minutes."</p><p>"Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.-- And for <i>me</i> to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have to guard others!"</p><p>She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,"That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I mustorder the carriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatiguedalready."</p><p>"I am,"--she answered--"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort offatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all know attimes what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, areexhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let mehave my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary."</p><p>Emma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and enteringinto her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, andwatched her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look wasgrateful--and her parting words, "Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort ofbeing sometimes alone!"--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, andto describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,even towards some of those who loved her best.</p><p>"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!" said Emma, as she turned backinto the hall again. "I do pity you. And the more sensibility youbetray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you."</p><p>Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had onlyaccomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when FrankChurchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she hadforgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him. Mrs.Weston would be at ease. The black mare was blameless; <i>they</i>were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had beendetained by a temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure,which had lasted some hours--and he had quite given up every thought ofcoming, till very late;--and had he known how hot a ride he shouldhave, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed heshould not have come at all. The heat was excessive; he had neversuffered any thing like it--almost wished he had staid at home--nothingkilled him like heat--he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heatwas intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest possible distancefrom the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking verydeplorable.</p><p>"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still," said Emma.</p><p>"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill bespared--but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all begoing soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met <i>one</i> as I came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!"</p><p>Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill'sstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out ofhumour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might behis constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were oftenthe cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking somerefreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in thedining-room--and she humanely pointed out the door.</p><p>"No--he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make himhotter." In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; andmuttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned allher attention to her father, saying in secret--</p><p>"I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like aman who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet easytemper will not mind it."</p><p>He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, andcame back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners,like himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest intheir employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be solate. He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improvethem; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. Theywere looking over views in Swisserland.</p><p>"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad," said he. "I shallnever be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have mysketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour to read--or mypoem. I shall do something to expose myself."</p><p>"That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never goto Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leaveEngland."</p><p>"They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed forher. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. Iassure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that Ishall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. Iwant a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetratingeyes may fancy--I am sick of England-- and would leave it to-morrow, ifI could."</p><p>"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"</p><p>"<i>I</i> sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken.I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I amthwarted in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all afortunate person."</p><p>"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Goand eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Anotherslice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make younearly on a par with the rest of us."</p><p>"No--I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure."</p><p>"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us. It is notSwisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in wantof a change. You will stay, and go with us?"</p><p>"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening."</p><p>"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning."</p><p>"No--It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross."</p><p>"Then pray stay at Richmond."</p><p>"But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you all there without me."</p><p>"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more."</p><p>The rest of the party were now returning, and all were sooncollected. With some there was great joy at the sight of FrankChurchill; others took it very composedly; but there was a very generaldistress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance beingexplained. That it was time for every body to go, concluded thesubject; and with a short final arrangement for the next day's scheme,they parted. Frank Churchill's little inclination to exclude himselfincreased so much, that his last words to Emma were,</p><p>"Well;--if <i>you</i> wish me to stay and join the party, I will."</p><p>She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.</p></span><span id = 243 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outwardcircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were infavour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiatingsafely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in goodtime. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, withthe Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every bodyhad a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amountof the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want ofspirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separatedtoo much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley tookcharge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to FrankChurchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonisebetter. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it nevermaterially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingnessto mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two wholehours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle ofseparation, between the other parties, too strong for any fineprospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.</p><p>At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen FrankChurchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing-- lookedwithout seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without knowingwhat she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harrietshould be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.</p><p>When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great dealbetter, for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her hisfirst object. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, waspaid to her. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed allthat he cared for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to beflattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendlyencouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given inthe first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but whichnow, in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment ofmost people looking on it must have had such an appearance as noEnglish word but flirtation could very well describe. "Mr. FrankChurchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively." They werelaying themselves open to that very phrase--and to having it sent offin a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not thatEmma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity; it was ratherbecause she felt less happy than she had expected. She laughed becauseshe was disappointed; and though she liked him for his attentions, andthought them all, whether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness,extremely judicious, they were not winning back her heart. She stillintended him for her friend.</p><p>"How much I am obliged to you," said he, "for telling me to cometo-day!-- If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost allthe happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again."</p><p>"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except thatyou were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend thanyou deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded tocome."</p><p>"Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me."</p><p>"It is hotter to-day."</p><p>"Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day."</p><p>"You are comfortable because you are under command."</p><p>"Your command?--Yes."</p><p>"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. Youhad, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from yourown management; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot bealways with you, it is best to believe your temper under your owncommand rather than mine."</p><p>"It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without amotive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be alwayswith me. You are always with me."</p><p>"Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence couldnot begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humourbefore."</p><p>"Three o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you first in February."</p><p>"Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)--nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talkingnonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people."</p><p>"I say nothing of which I am ashamed," replied he, with livelyimpudence. "I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hillhear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, andDorking on the other. I saw you first in February." And thenwhispering-- "Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we doto rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They <i>shall</i> talk. Ladiesand gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,presides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinkingof?"</p><p>Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a greatdeal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr.Knightley's answer was the most distinct.</p><p>"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of?"</p><p>"Oh! no, no"--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--"Upon no account in the world. It is the very last thing I would standthe brunt of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you areall thinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two,perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I mightnot be afraid of knowing."</p><p>"It is a sort of thing," cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, "which <i>I</i> should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though, perhaps, as the <i>Chaperon</i> of the party-- <i>I</i> never was in any circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--"</p><p>Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,</p><p>"Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed--quite unheardof-- but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Everybody knows what is due to <i>you</i>."</p><p>"It will not do," whispered Frank to Emma; "they are most of themaffronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies andgentlemen--I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives herright of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and onlyrequires something very entertaining from each of you, in a generalway. Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased tosay, am very entertaining already,) and she only demands from each ofyou either one thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original orrepeated--or two things moderately clever-- or three things very dullindeed, and she engages to laugh heartily at them all."</p><p>"Oh! very well," exclaimed Miss Bates, "then I need not be uneasy.`Three things very dull indeed.' That will just do for me, you know. Ishall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,shan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence onevery body's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?"</p><p>Emma could not resist.</p><p>"Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me--but you will be limited as to number--only three at once."</p><p>Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did notimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could notanger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.</p><p>"Ah!--well--to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself verydisagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend."</p><p>"I like your plan," cried Mr. Weston. "Agreed, agreed. I will do my best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?"</p><p>"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low," answered his son;--"but we shall be indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way."</p><p>"No, no," said Emma, "it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let mehear it."</p><p>"I doubt its being very clever myself," said Mr. Weston. "It is toomuch a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters of thealphabet are there, that express perfection?"</p><p>"What two letters!--express perfection! I am sure I do not know."</p><p>"Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will neverguess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?"</p><p>Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a veryindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at andenjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem to touchthe rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, andMr. Knightley gravely said,</p><p>"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr.Weston has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked upevery body else. <i>Perfection</i> should not have come quite so soon."</p><p>"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused," said Mrs. Elton; "<i>I</i>really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I hadan acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at allpleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!-- You knowwho I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very wellat Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out ofplace, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country insummer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who havewitty things at every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit. Ihave a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must beallowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, ifyou please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. Wehave nothing clever to say-- not one of us.</p><p>"Yes, yes, pray pass <i>me</i>," added her husband, with a sort of sneering consciousness; "<i>I</i>have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse, or any otheryoung lady. An old married man-- quite good for nothing. Shall we walk,Augusta?"</p><p>"With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot. Come, Jane, take my other arm."</p><p>Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off."Happy couple!" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out ofhearing:--"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying asthey did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--Theyonly knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!--for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, orany public place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be noknowledge. It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among theirown set, just as they always are, that you can form any just judgment.Short of that, it is all guess and luck-- and will generally beill-luck. How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance,and rued it all the rest of his life!"</p><p>Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own confederates, spoke now.</p><p>"Such things do occur, undoubtedly."--She was stopped by a cough. Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.</p><p>"You were speaking," said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.</p><p>"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunatecircumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannotimagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment mayarise-- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. Iwould be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolutecharacters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, anoppression for ever."</p><p>He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon afterwards said, in a lively tone,</p><p>"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that wheneverI marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turningto Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like anybody fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with asmile at his father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopther, educate her."</p><p>"And make her like myself."</p><p>"By all means, if you can."</p><p>"Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife."</p><p>"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothingelse. I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return, Ishall come to you for my wife. Remember."</p><p>Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touchevery favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creaturedescribed? Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all thathe wished. He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment;who could say? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.</p><p>"Now, ma'am," said Jane to her aunt, "shall we join Mrs. Elton?"</p><p>"If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I wasready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shallsoon overtake her. There she is--no, that's somebody else. That's oneof the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.-- Well, Ideclare--"</p><p>They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr.Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man'sspirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired atlast of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walkingquietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, andquite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful viewsbeneath her. The appearance of the servants looking out for them togive notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle ofcollecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton tohave <i>her</i> carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospectof the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionableenjoyments of this day of pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of somany ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.</p><p>While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side.He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,</p><p>"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: aprivilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still useit. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How couldyou be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in yourwit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?-- Emma, I had notthought it possible."</p><p>Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.</p><p>"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helpedit. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me."</p><p>"I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked ofit since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it-- with whatcandour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring yourforbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was forever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must beso irksome."</p><p>"Oh!" cried Emma, "I know there is not a better creature in theworld: but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous aremost unfortunately blended in her."</p><p>"They are blended," said he, "I acknowledge; and, were sheprosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of theridiculous over the good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leaveevery harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel withyou for any liberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation--but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case. She is poor;she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to oldage, must probably sink more. Her situation should secure yourcompassion. It was badly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from aninfant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was anhonour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of themoment, laugh at her, humble her--and before her niece, too--and beforeothers, many of whom (certainly <i>some</i>,) would be entirely guided by <i>your</i>treatment of her.--This is not pleasant to you, Emma--and it is veryfar from pleasant to me; but I must, I will,--I will tell you truthswhile I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithfulcounsel, and trusting that you will some time or other do me greaterjustice than you can do now."</p><p>While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it wasready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He hadmisinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and hertongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and,on entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome--thenreproaching herself for having taken no leave, making noacknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out withvoice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. Hehad turned away, and the horses were in motion. She continued to lookback, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, theywere half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. She wasvexed beyond what could have been expressed--almost beyond what shecould conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, atany circumstance in her life. She was most forcibly struck. The truthof this representation there was no denying. She felt it at her heart.How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How couldshe have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! Andhow suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, ofconcurrence, of common kindness!</p><p>Time did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but tofeel it more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was notnecessary to speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spiritsherself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tearsrunning down her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at anytrouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.</p></span><span id = 246 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts allthe evening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, shecould not tell. They, in their different homes, and their differentways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it wasa morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rationalsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, thanany she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with herfather, was felicity to it. <i>There</i>, indeed, lay real pleasure,for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four tohis comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of hisfond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her generalconduct, be open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped shewas not without a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, "Howcould you be so unfeeling to your father?-- I must, I will tell youtruths while I can." Miss Bates should never again--no, never! Ifattention, in future, could do away the past, she might hope to beforgiven. She had been often remiss, her conscience told her so;remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact; scornful, ungracious. Butit should be so no more. In the warmth of true contrition, she wouldcall upon her the very next morning, and it should be the beginning, onher side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.</p><p>She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,that nothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, thatshe might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come inwhile she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not beashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.</p><p>"The ladies were all at home." She had never rejoiced at the soundbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or ofderiving it, except in subsequent ridicule.</p><p>There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving andtalking. She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in ahurry; the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would bepleased to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The auntand niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had adistinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door hadshut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, "Well, my dear, I shall <i>say</i> you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough."</p><p>Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on.</p><p>"I am afraid Jane is not very well," said she, "but I do not know; they <i>tell</i>me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently, MissWoodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I amvery little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where you like? Iam sure she will be here presently."</p><p>Emma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment's fear of MissBates keeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came--"Very happy andobliged"--but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the samecheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner. A veryfriendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to areturn of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.</p><p>"Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--and are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed,in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying forus to part with her, after having had her so long, and she has adreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:-- such longletters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon.`My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself'-- for tears were in hereyes perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a greatchange; and though she is amazingly fortunate--such a situation, Isuppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out--donot think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising goodfortune--(again dispersing her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you wereto see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know onecannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low aspossible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happyshe is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not comingto you--she is not able--she is gone into her own room-- I want her tolie down upon the bed. `My dear,' said I, `I shall say you are laiddown upon the bed:' but, however, she is not; she is walking about theroom. But, now that she has written her letters, she says she shallsoon be well. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, MissWoodhouse, but your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting atthe door--I was quite ashamed-- but somehow there was a littlebustle--for it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and tillyou were on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming. `It isonly Mrs. Cole,' said I, `depend upon it. Nobody else would come soearly.' `Well,' said she, `it must be borne some time or other, and itmay as well be now.' But then Patty came in, and said it was you. `Oh!'said I, `it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.'--`I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away; andthat was what made us keep you waiting--and extremely sorry and ashamedwe were. `If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must, and I will sayyou are laid down upon the bed.'"</p><p>Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growingkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings actedas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothingbut pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentlesensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might verynaturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, whenshe might not bear to see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnestregret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances whichshe collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, mightbe as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible. "Itmust be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it was to bedelayed till Colonel Campbell's return."</p><p>"So very kind!" replied Miss Bates. "But you are always kind."</p><p>There was no bearing such an "always;" and to break through her dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--</p><p>"Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?"</p><p>"To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have thecharge of her three little girls--delightful children. Impossible thatany situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except,perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but Mrs.Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very sameneighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove. Jane will beonly four miles from Maple Grove."</p><p>"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--"</p><p>"Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. Shewould not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, `No;' for whenJane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the verymorning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quitedecided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention;exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing tillColonel Campbell's return, and nothing should induce her to enter intoany engagement at present--and so she told Mrs. Elton over and overagain--and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change hermind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, sawfarther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out insuch a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but shepositively declared she would <i>not</i> write any such denialyesterday, as Jane wished her; she would wait--and, sure enough,yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go. Quite asurprize to me! I had not the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside,and told her at once, that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs.Smallridge's situation, she had come to the resolution of acceptingit.--I did not know a word of it till it was all settled."</p><p>"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?"</p><p>"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so,upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. `You <i>must</i> <i>all</i> spend your evening with us,' said she--`I positively must have you <i>all</i> come.'"</p><p>"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?"</p><p>"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though Ithought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not lethim off, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,and a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, MissWoodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemedrather fagged after the morning's party. Even pleasure, you know, isfatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to haveenjoyed it. However, <i>I</i> shall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it."</p><p>"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been making up her mind the whole day?"</p><p>"I dare say she had."</p><p>"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all herfriends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that ispossible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family."</p><p>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thingin the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings andBragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberaland elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a mostdelightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove--andas to the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges,there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will betreated with such regard and kindness!-- It will be nothing butpleasure, a life of pleasure.--And her salary!-- I really cannotventure to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used asyou are to great sums, would hardly believe that so much could be givento a young person like Jane."</p><p>"Ah! madam," cried Emma, "if other children are at all like what Iremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount ofwhat I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearlyearned."</p><p>"You are so noble in your ideas!"</p><p>"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"</p><p>"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within afortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does notknow how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, andsay, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more."</p><p>"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel andMrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself beforetheir return?"</p><p>"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such asituation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was soastonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs.Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating meupon it! It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea,because we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea, becauseI remember thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; somethinghappened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the roombefore tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. Poor oldJohn, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor fathertwenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and verypoorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints-- I must go and see himto-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poorJohn's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; heis very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown,ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep hisfather without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told uswhat John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about thechaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill toRichmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Janespoke to Mrs. Elton."</p><p>Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new thiscircumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that shecould be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill'sgoing, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.</p><p>What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being theaccumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of theservants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmondsoon after the return of the party from Box Hill-- which messenger,however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill hadsent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerableaccount of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay comingback beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill havingresolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horseseeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for theCrown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boygoing a good pace, and driving very steady.</p><p>There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and itcaught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject whichalready engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill'simportance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was everything, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference ofwoman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,till roused by Miss Bates's saying,</p><p>"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is tobecome of that?--Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it justnow.-- `You must go,' said she. `You and I must part. You will have nobusiness here.--Let it stay, however,' said she; `give it houseroomtill Colonel Campbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he willsettle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'-- And tothis day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his present or hisdaughter's."</p><p>Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembranceof all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so littlepleasing, that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had beenlong enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she couldventure to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.</p></span><span id = 248 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were notinterrupted; but on entering the parlour, she found those who mustrouse her. Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence,and were sitting with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up,and in a manner decidedly graver than usual, said,</p><p>"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time tospare, and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London,to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to sendor say, besides the `love,' which nobody carries?"</p><p>"Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?"</p><p>"Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time."</p><p>Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to befriends again. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going-- herfather began his inquiries.</p><p>"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you findmy worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have beenvery much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs.and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always soattentive to them!"</p><p>Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with asmile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.Knightley.-- It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression inher favour, as if his eyes received the truth from her's, and all thathad passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--He looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified-- andin another moment still more so, by a little movement of more thancommon friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;-- whether she hadnot herself made the first motion, she could not say-- she might,perhaps, have rather offered it--but he took her hand, pressed it, andcertainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips-- when, from somefancy or other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such ascruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done, shecould not perceive.--He would have judged better, she thought, if hehad not stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable; and whetherit was that his manners had in general so little gallantry, or howeverelse it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.-- It waswith him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.-- She could not butrecall the attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfectamity.--He left them immediately afterwards-- gone in a moment. Healways moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither beundecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden than usual in hisdisappearance.</p><p>Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wishedshe had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a greatpleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square,for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might havehappened at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it, wouldhave been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however; she couldnot be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and hisunfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fullyrecovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half anhour, she found. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!</p><p>In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from thedisagreeableness of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going sosuddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on theeffect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,-- interested,without disturbing him. He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax'sgoing out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr.Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.</p><p>"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be socomfortably settled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, andI dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope itis a dry situation, and that her health will be taken good care of. Itought to be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always waswith me. You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady whatMiss Taylor was to us. And I hope she will be better off in onerespect, and not be induced to go away after it has been her home solong."</p><p>The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thingelse into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announcethe death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particularreason to hasten back on her account, she had not lived abovesix-and-thirty hours after his return. A sudden seizure of a differentnature from any thing foreboded by her general state, had carried heroff after a short struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.</p><p>It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree ofgravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for thesurviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know whereshe would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoopsto folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to bedisagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, wasnow spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fullyjustified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. Theevent acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness ofimaginary complaints.</p><p>"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try thetemper. It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults, whatwould Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's loss would bedreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it."-- Even Mr.Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, "Ah! poor woman,who would have thought it!" and resolved, that his mourning should beas handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising overher broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady.How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. Itwas also a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs.Churchill, the grief of her husband--her mind glanced over them bothwith awe and compassion--and then rested with lightened feelings on howFrank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She sawin a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smithwould have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of hiswife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded intoany thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that thenephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in thecause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.</p><p>Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with greatself-command. What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayednothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her ofstrengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that mightendanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill'sdeath with mutual forbearance.</p><p>Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicatingall that was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr.Churchill was better than could be expected; and their first removal,on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the houseof a very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had beenpromising a visit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing tobe done for Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yetbe possible on Emma's side.</p><p>It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax,whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whoseengagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wishedto shew her kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. Shehad scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness; and theperson, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now the veryone on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard orsympathy. She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew a value forher society, and testify respect and consideration. She resolved toprevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urgeit. The invitation was refused, and by a verbal message. "Miss Fairfaxwas not well enough to write;" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield,the same morning, it appeared that she was so much indisposed as tohave been visited, though against her own consent, by himself, and thatshe was suffering under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to adegree, which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs.Smallridge's at the time proposed. Her health seemed for the momentcompletely deranged-- appetite quite gone--and though there were noabsolutely alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint,which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasyabout her. He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to,and that she felt it so herself, though she would not own it. Herspirits seemed overcome. Her present home, he could not but observe,was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:-- confined always to oneroom;--he could have wished it otherwise-- and her good aunt, thoughhis very old friend, he must acknowledge to be not the best companionfor an invalid of that description. Her care and attention could not bequestioned; they were, in fact, only too great. He very much fearedthat Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them. Emma listenedwith the warmest concern; grieved for her more and more, and lookedaround eager to discover some way of being useful. To take her--be itonly an hour or two--from her aunt, to give her change of air andscene, and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two, mightdo her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say, in themost feeling language she could command, that she would call for her inthe carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she hadMr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour of such exercise for hispatient. The answer was only in this short note:</p><p>"Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any exercise."</p><p>Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but itwas impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewedindisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might bestcounteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of theanswer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's,in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her-- but it would notdo;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeingwith her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatestservice--and every thing that message could do was tried-- but all invain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quiteunpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make herworse.--Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appearthat she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in."Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see anybody--any body at all-- Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--andMrs. Cole had made such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but,except them, Jane would really see nobody."</p><p>Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs.Perrys, and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted,therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece'sappetite and diet, which she longed to be able to assist. On thatsubject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy, and very communicative; Janewould hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food;but every thing they could command (and never had any body such goodneighbours) was distasteful.</p><p>Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to anexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior qualitywas speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. Inhalf an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks fromMiss Bates, but "dear Jane would not be satisfied without its beingsent back; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover, sheinsisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing."</p><p>When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wanderingabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon ofthe very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to anyexercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,she could have no doubt--putting every thing together-- that Jane wasresolved to receive no kindness from <i>her</i>. She was sorry, verysorry. Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the morepitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency ofaction, and inequality of powers; and it mortified her that she wasgiven so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthyas a friend: but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentionswere good, and of being able to say to herself, that could Mr.Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting JaneFairfax, could he even have seen into her heart, he would not, on thisoccasion, have found any thing to reprove.</p></span><span id = 251 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma wascalled downstairs to Mr. Weston, who "could not stay five minutes, andwanted particularly to speak with her."-- He met her at theparlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key ofhis voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,</p><p>"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it be possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you."</p><p>"Is she unwell?"</p><p>"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you <i>alone</i>, and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?"</p><p>"Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refusewhat you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?-- Is she reallynot ill?"</p><p>"Depend upon me--but ask no more questions. You will know it all in time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!"</p><p>To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.Something really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as herfriend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it withher father, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston weresoon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace forRandalls.</p><p>"Now,"--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,-- "now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened."</p><p>"No, no,"--he gravely replied.--"Don't ask me. I promised my wife toleave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do notbe impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon."</p><p>"Break it to me," cried Emma, standing still with terror.-- "GoodGod!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened in BrunswickSquare. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment whatit is."</p><p>"No, indeed you are mistaken."--</p><p>"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearestfriends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?-- I chargeyou by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment."</p><p>"Upon my word, Emma."--</p><p>"Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour,that it has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!--What can beto be <i>broke</i> to me, that does not relate to one of that family?"</p><p>"Upon my honour," said he very seriously, "it does not. It is not inthe smallest degree connected with any human being of the name ofKnightley."</p><p>Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.</p><p>"I was wrong," he continued, "in talking of its being <i>broke</i>to you. I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does notconcern you-- it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--Inshort, my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. Idon't say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might bemuch worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls."</p><p>Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort.She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being somemoney concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable naturein the circumstances of the family,--something which the late event atRichmond had brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozennatural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!-- This, though veryundesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired littlemore than an animating curiosity.</p><p>"Who is that gentleman on horseback?" said she, as they proceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with anyother view.</p><p>"I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, Iassure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by thistime."</p><p>"Has your son been with you, then?"</p><p>"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind."</p><p>For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded and demure,</p><p>"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did."</p><p>They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--"Well, my dear,"said he, as they entered the room--"I have brought her, and now I hopeyou will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use indelay. I shall not be far off, if you want me."-- And Emma distinctlyheard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--"I havebeen as good as my word. She has not the least idea."</p><p>Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so muchperturbation, that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment theywere alone, she eagerly said,</p><p>"What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, Ifind, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is. I have beenwalking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Donot let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of yourdistress, whatever it may be."</p><p>"Have you indeed no idea?" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice."Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you areto hear?"</p><p>"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess."</p><p>"You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell youdirectly;" (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against lookingup.) "He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinaryerrand. It is impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak tohis father on a subject,--to announce an attachment--"</p><p>She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of Harriet.</p><p>"More than an attachment, indeed," resumed Mrs. Weston; "anengagement-- a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what willany body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfaxare engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!"</p><p>Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,</p><p>"Jane Fairfax!--Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?"</p><p>"You may well be amazed," returned Mrs. Weston, still averting hereyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time torecover-- "You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been asolemn engagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth,and kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it butthemselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.-- It is sowonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yetalmost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.-- I thought Iknew him."</p><p>Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between twoideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; andpoor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim, and requireconfirmation, repeated confirmation.</p><p>"Well," said she at last, trying to recover herself; "this is acircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can atall comprehend it. What!--engaged to her all the winter-- before eitherof them came to Highbury?"</p><p>"Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, very much. It has hurt his father equally. <i>Some</i> <i>part</i> of his conduct we cannot excuse."</p><p>Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, "I will not pretend <i>not</i>to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, beassured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as youare apprehensive of."</p><p>Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as steady as her words.</p><p>"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of mypresent perfect indifference," she continued, "I will farther tell you,that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when Idid like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him--nay,was attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,for at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You maybelieve me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth."</p><p>Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could findutterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more goodthan any thing else in the world could do.</p><p>"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself," said she."On this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that youmight be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it wasso.-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account."</p><p>"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit <i>him</i>,Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. Whatright had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged, andwith manners so <i>very</i> disengaged? What right had he to endeavourto please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman withpersevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged toanother?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?-- Howcould he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?-- verywrong, very wrong indeed."</p><p>"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--"</p><p>"And how could <i>she</i> bear such behaviour! Composure with awitness! to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to anotherwoman, before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree ofplacidity, which I can neither comprehend nor respect."</p><p>"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said soexpressly. He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was hereonly a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did notallow the full use even of the time he could stay-- but that there hadbeen misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed,seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might verypossibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct."</p><p>"Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure. Much, muchbeyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk himin my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!-- None of that uprightintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdainof trick and littleness, which a man should display in everytransaction of his life."</p><p>"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has beenwrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for hishaving many, very many, good qualities; and--"</p><p>"Good God!" cried Emma, not attending to her.--"Mrs. Smallridge,too! Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could hemean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself-- tosuffer her even to think of such a measure!"</p><p>"He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquithim. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him--orat least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.-- Tillyesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. Theyburst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message-- and itwas the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project of hers,which determined him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle,throw himself on his kindness, and, in short, put an end to themiserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long."</p><p>Emma began to listen better.</p><p>"I am to hear from him soon," continued Mrs. Weston. "He told me atparting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner whichseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Letus wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. Itmay make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to beunderstood. Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry tocondemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I amsatisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxiousfor its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They mustboth have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy andconcealment."</p><p>"<i>His</i> sufferings," replied Emma dryly, "do not appear to have done him much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"</p><p>"Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely adifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in thatfamily! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not havebeen a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains atrest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactlyopposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, whenundue influence does not survive the grave!-- He gave his consent withvery little persuasion."</p><p>"Ah!" thought Emma, "he would have done as much for Harriet."</p><p>"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light thismorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, sometime--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back tohis uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as Itell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.-- He was verymuch agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him appearquite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen himbefore.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock offinding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal."</p><p>"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on withsuch perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them knowof the engagement?"</p><p>Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.</p><p>"None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves."</p><p>"Well," said Emma, "I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled tothe idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it avery abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system ofhypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?-- To come among uswith professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league insecret to judge us all!--Here have we been, the whole winter andspring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing oftruth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have beencarrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments andwords that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take theconsequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way notperfectly agreeable!"</p><p>"I am quite easy on that head," replied Mrs. Weston. "I am very surethat I never said any thing of either to the other, which both mightnot have heard."</p><p>"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady."</p><p>"True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of MissFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; andas to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe."</p><p>At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from thewindow, evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invitedhim in; and, while he was coming round, added, "Now, dearest Emma, letme intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart atease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make thebest of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in herfavour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does notfeel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstancefor him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to agirl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have alwaysgiven her credit for-- and still am disposed to give her credit for, inspite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. Andhow much may be said in her situation for even that error!"</p><p>"Much, indeed!" cried Emma feelingly. "If a woman can ever beexcused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like JaneFairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the world is nottheir's, nor the world's law.'"</p><p>She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance, exclaiming,</p><p>"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! Thiswas a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise mytalent of guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you hadlost half your property, at least. And here, instead of its being amatter of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--Icongratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect ofhaving one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in Englandfor your daughter."</p><p>A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all wasas right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spiritswas immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: heshook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on thesubject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time andpersuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His companionssuggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections;and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talkedit all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he wasbecome perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very bestthing that Frank could possibly have done.</p></span><span id = 253 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma wascalled downstairs to Mr. Weston, who "could not stay five minutes, andwanted particularly to speak with her."-- He met her at theparlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key ofhis voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,</p><p>"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it be possible.

Not a creature knowing it butthemselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.-- It is sowonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yetalmost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.-- I thought Iknew him."</p><p>Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between twoideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; andpoor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim, and requireconfirmation, repeated confirmation.</p><p>"Well," said she at last, trying to recover herself; "this is acircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can atall comprehend it. What!--engaged to her all the winter-- before eitherof them came to Highbury?"</p><p>"Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, very much. It has hurt his father equally. <i>Some</i> <i>part</i> of his conduct we cannot excuse."</p><p>Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, "I will not pretend <i>not</i>to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, beassured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as youare apprehensive of."</p><p>Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as steady as her words.</p><p>"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of mypresent perfect indifference," she continued, "I will farther tell you,that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when Idid like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him--nay,was attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,for at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You maybelieve me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth."</p><p>Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could findutterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more goodthan any thing else in the world could do.</p><p>"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself," said she."On this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that youmight be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it wasso.-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account."</p><p>"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit <i>him</i>,Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. Whatright had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged, andwith manners so <i>very</i> disengaged? What right had he to endeavourto please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman withpersevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged toanother?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?-- Howcould he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?-- verywrong, very wrong indeed."</p><p>"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--"</p><p>"And how could <i>she</i> bear such behaviour! Composure with awitness! to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to anotherwoman, before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree ofplacidity, which I can neither comprehend nor respect."</p><p>"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said soexpressly. He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was hereonly a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did notallow the full use even of the time he could stay-- but that there hadbeen misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed,seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might verypossibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct."</p><p>"Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure. Much, muchbeyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk himin my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!-- None of that uprightintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdainof trick and littleness, which a man should display in everytransaction of his life."</p><p>"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has beenwrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for hishaving many, very many, good qualities; and--"</p><p>"Good God!" cried Emma, not attending to her.--"Mrs. Smallridge,too! Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could hemean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself-- tosuffer her even to think of such a measure!"</p><p>"He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquithim. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him--orat least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.-- Tillyesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. Theyburst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message-- and itwas the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project of hers,which determined him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle,throw himself on his kindness, and, in short, put an end to themiserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long."</p><p>Emma began to listen better.</p><p>"I am to hear from him soon," continued Mrs. Weston. "He told me atparting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner whichseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Letus wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. Itmay make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to beunderstood. Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry tocondemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I amsatisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxiousfor its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They mustboth have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy andconcealment."</p><p>"<i>His</i> sufferings," replied Emma dryly, "do not appear to have done him much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"</p><p>"Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely adifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in thatfamily! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not havebeen a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains atrest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactlyopposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, whenundue influence does not survive the grave!-- He gave his consent withvery little persuasion."</p><p>"Ah!" thought Emma, "he would have done as much for Harriet."</p><p>"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light thismorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, sometime--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back tohis uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as Itell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.-- He was verymuch agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him appearquite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen himbefore.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock offinding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal."</p><p>"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on withsuch perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them knowof the engagement?"</p><p>Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.</p><p>"None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves."</p><p>"Well," said Emma, "I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled tothe idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it avery abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system ofhypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?-- To come among uswith professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league insecret to judge us all!--Here have we been, the whole winter andspring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing oftruth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have beencarrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments andwords that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take theconsequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way notperfectly agreeable!"</p><p>"I am quite easy on that head," replied Mrs. Weston. "I am very surethat I never said any thing of either to the other, which both mightnot have heard."</p><p>"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady."</p><p>"True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of MissFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; andas to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe."</p><p>At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from thewindow, evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invitedhim in; and, while he was coming round, added, "Now, dearest Emma, letme intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart atease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make thebest of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in herfavour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does notfeel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstancefor him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to agirl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have alwaysgiven her credit for-- and still am disposed to give her credit for, inspite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. Andhow much may be said in her situation for even that error!"</p><p>"Much, indeed!" cried Emma feelingly. "If a woman can ever beexcused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like JaneFairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the world is nottheir's, nor the world's law.'"</p><p>She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance, exclaiming,</p><p>"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! Thiswas a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise mytalent of guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you hadlost half your property, at least. And here, instead of its being amatter of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--Icongratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect ofhaving one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in Englandfor your daughter."</p><p>A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all wasas right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spiritswas immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: heshook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on thesubject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time andpersuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His companionssuggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections;and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talkedit all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he wasbecome perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very bestthing that Frank could possibly have done.</p></span><span id = 256 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being <i>first</i>with Mr. Knightley, first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that itwas so, and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection;and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressiblyimportant it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first;for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been onlyIsabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she had alwaysknown exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herselfbeen first with him for many years past. She had not deserved it; shehad often been negligent or perverse, slighting his advice, or evenwilfully opposing him, insensible of half his merits, and quarrellingwith him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolentestimate of her own--but still, from family attachment and habit, andthorough excellence of mind, he had loved her, and watched over herfrom a girl, with an endeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for herdoing right, which no other creature had at all shared. In spite of allher faults, she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, verydear?-- When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here,presented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them. HarrietSmith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly,exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley. <i>She</i> could not. She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to <i>her</i>.She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.-- How shockedhad he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how stronglyhad he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not too strongly forthe offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softerthan upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.-- She had no hope,nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could have that sort ofaffection for herself which was now in question; but there was a hope(at times a slight one, at times much stronger,) that Harriet mighthave deceived herself, and be overrating his regard for <i>her</i>.--Wishit she must, for his sake--be the consequence nothing to herself, buthis remaining single all his life. Could she be secure of that, indeed,of his never marrying at all, she believed she should be perfectlysatisfied.--Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and herfather, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell andHartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship andconfidence, and her peace would be fully secured.--Marriage, in fact,would not do for her. It would be incompatible with what she owed toher father, and with what she felt for him. Nothing should separate herfrom her father. She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr.Knightley.</p><p>It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; andshe hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might atleast be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She shouldsee them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly asshe had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did notknow how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expectedback every day. The power of observation would be soongiven--frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in onecourse. In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- Itwould do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good, to betalking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced, as longas she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet'sconfidence. To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her,therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not, atpresent, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction, thatall farther confidential discussion of <i>one</i> topic had better beavoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass beforethey met again, except in the company of others--she objected only to atete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten theconversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved, and wasgrateful.</p><p>This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma'sthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who hadbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in herway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, torelate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.</p><p>Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through hisshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having theninduced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned withmuch more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than aquarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all theencumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.</p><p>A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while herfriend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good dealof agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go atall at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead,and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, andMr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known;as, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paidwithout leading to reports:-- but Mr. Weston had thought differently;he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax andher family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited byit; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for "suchthings," he observed, "always got about." Emma smiled, and felt thatMr. Weston had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, inshort--and very great had been the evident distress and confusion ofthe lady. She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look andaction had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness. Thequiet, heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturousdelight of her daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were bothso truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in everysensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and solittle of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them.Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Westonto invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first,but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive,Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of herembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their firstreception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was alwaysfeeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open thecause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a gooddeal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs.Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest reliefto her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had solong been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on thesubject.</p><p>"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment ofso many months," continued Mrs. Weston, "she was energetic. This wasone of her expressions. `I will not say, that since I entered into theengagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that Ihave never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'-- and thequivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I feltat my heart."</p><p>"Poor girl!" said Emma. "She thinks herself wrong, then, for having consented to a private engagement?"</p><p>"Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposedto blame herself. `The consequence,' said she, `has been a state ofperpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all thepunishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been actingcontrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that everything has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what myconscience tells me ought not to be.' `Do not imagine, madam,' shecontinued, `that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall onthe principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The errorhas been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse thatpresent circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making thestory known to Colonel Campbell.'"</p><p>"Poor girl!" said Emma again. "She loves him then excessively, Isuppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be ledto form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered herjudgment."</p><p>"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him."</p><p>"I am afraid," returned Emma, sighing, "that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy."</p><p>"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But sheprobably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to themisunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One naturalconsequence of the evil she had involved herself in," she said, "wasthat of making her <i>unreasonable</i>. The consciousness of havingdone amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made hercaptious and irritable to a degree that must have been-- that hadbeen--hard for him to bear. `I did not make the allowances,' said she,`which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits-- hisdelightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition,which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure, have been asconstantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.' She then began tospeak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn her during herillness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected,desired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank you--I could notthank you too much--for every wish and every endeavour to do her good.She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgmentfrom herself."</p><p>"If I did not know her to be happy now," said Emma, seriously,"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulousconscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! Mrs.Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good Ihave done Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking herself, and trying to be morelively), this is all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring methese interesting particulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage.I am sure she is very good-- I hope she will be very happy. It is fitthat the fortune should be on his side, for I think the merit will beall on hers."</p><p>Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. Shethought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, sheloved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. Shetalked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection-- butshe had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone toBrunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; andwhen Mrs. Weston ended with, "We have not yet had the letter we are soanxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come," she was obligedto pause before she answered, and at last obliged to answer at random,before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were soanxious for.</p><p>"Are you well, my Emma?" was Mrs. Weston's parting question.</p><p>"Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible."</p><p>Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food forunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and hersense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regrettednot having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for theenvious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attentionto Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know herbetter; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured tofind a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in allprobability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on hernow.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one asan associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and theother--what was she?--Supposing even that they had never becomeintimate friends; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax'sconfidence on this important matter-- which was most probable--still,in knowing her as she ought, and as she might, she must have beenpreserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment toMr. Dixon, which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harbouredherself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatlyfeared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy ofJane's feelings, by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Ofall the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her coming toHighbury, she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst.She must have been a perpetual enemy. They never could have been allthree together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in athousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony ofa mind that would bear no more.</p><p>The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in,and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which thewind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made suchcruel sights the longer visible.</p><p>The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kepttolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter'sside, and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before. Itreminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs.Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon aftertea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightfulproofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed,might shortly be over. The picture which she had then drawn of theprivations of the approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friendshad deserted them, no pleasures had been lost.--But her presentforebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction. Theprospect before her now, was threatening to a degree that could not beentirely dispelled-- that might not be even partially brightened. Ifall took place that might take place among the circle of her friends,Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer herfather with the spirits only of ruined happiness.</p><p>The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearerthan herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it.They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husbandalso.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and MissFairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong toHighbury. They would be married, and settled either at or nearEnscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to theselosses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain ofcheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to beno longer coming there for his evening comfort!-- No longer walking inat all hours, as if ever willing to change his own home fortheir's!--How was it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to themfor Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as findingin Harriet's society all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be thechosen, the first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he lookedfor all the best blessings of existence; what could be increasingEmma's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind,that it had been all her own work?</p><p>When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrainfrom a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room fora few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation orcomposure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own betterconduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety mightbe the following and every future winter of her life to the past, itwould yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, andleave her less to regret when it were gone.</p></span><span id = 259 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>The weather continued much the same all the following morning; andthe same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign atHartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into asofter quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it wassummer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives,Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had theexquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, andbrilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed forthe serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's comingin soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, shelost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spiritsfreshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns,when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and comingtowards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned fromLondon. She had been thinking of him the moment before, asunquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for thequickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and calm. In half aminute they were together. The "How d'ye do's" were quiet andconstrained on each side. She asked after their mutual friends; theywere all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning. He must havehad a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her, she found. "He hadjust looked into the dining-room, and as he was not wanted there,preferred being out of doors."--She thought he neither looked nor spokecheerfully; and the first possible cause for it, suggested by herfears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to hisbrother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.</p><p>They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was oftenlooking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suitedher to give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wantedto speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching forencouragement to begin.--She did not, could not, feel equal to lead theway to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could notbear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. Sheconsidered--resolved--and, trying to smile, began--</p><p>"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather surprize you."</p><p>"Have I?" said he quietly, and looking at her; "of what nature?"</p><p>"Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding."</p><p>After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he replied,</p><p>"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that already."</p><p>"How is it possible?" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towardshim; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have calledat Mrs. Goddard's in his way.</p><p>"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning,and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened."</p><p>Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more composure,</p><p>"<i>You</i> probably have been less surprized than any of us, foryou have had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once triedto give me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with asinking voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed toblindness."</p><p>For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious ofhaving excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawnwithin his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying,in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,</p><p>"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your ownexcellent sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know you willnot allow yourself--." Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in amore broken and subdued accent, "The feelings of the warmestfriendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!"-- And in a louder,steadier tone, he concluded with, "He will soon be gone. They will soonbe in Yorkshire. I am sorry for <i>her</i>. She deserves a better fate."</p><p>Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from theflutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,</p><p>"You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set youright.-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness towhat was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always beashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many thingswhich may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have noother reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier."</p><p>"Emma!" cried he, looking eagerly at her, "are you, indeed?"-- butchecking himself--"No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleasedthat you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret, indeed! andit will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes theacknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that youraffections were not farther entangled!--I could never, I confess, fromyour manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt-- I couldonly be certain that there was a preference--and a preference which Inever believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name ofman.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?-- Jane,Jane, you will be a miserable creature."</p><p>"Mr. Knightley," said Emma, trying to be lively, but reallyconfused-- "I am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let youcontinue in your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such animpression, I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that Inever have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as itmight be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly thereverse.-- But I never have."</p><p>He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but hewould not. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled tohis clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lowerherself in his opinion. She went on, however.</p><p>"I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by hisattentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.-- An old story,probably--a common case--and no more than has happened to hundreds ofmy sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who setsup as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted thetemptation. He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was continually here--Ialways found him very pleasant--and, in short, for (with a sigh) let meswell out the causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this atlast--my vanity was flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly,however--for some time, indeed-- I have had no idea of their meaningany thing.--I thought them a habit, a trick, nothing that called forseriousness on my side. He has imposed on me, but he has not injuredme. I have never been attached to him. And now I can tolerablycomprehend his behaviour. He never wished to attach me. It was merely ablind to conceal his real situation with another.--It was his object toblind all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectuallyblinded than myself--except that I was <i>not</i> blinded--that it was my good fortune--that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him."</p><p>She had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that herconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far asshe could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usualtone, he said,</p><p>"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,however, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him hasbeen but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, hemay yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have nomotive for wishing him ill--and for her sake, whose happiness will beinvolved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish himwell."</p><p>"I have no doubt of their being happy together," said Emma; "I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached."</p><p>"He is a most fortunate man!" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy."So early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man chusesa wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn sucha prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, hasbefore him!--Assured of the love of such a woman--the disinterestedlove, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness;every thing in his favour,-- equality of situation--I mean, as far asregards society, and all the habits and manners that are important;equality in every point but one-- and that one, since the purity of herheart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for itwill be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man wouldalways wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes herfrom; and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of <i>her</i>regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is,indeed, the favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for hisgood.--He meets with a young woman at a watering-place, gains heraffection, cannot even weary her by negligent treatment--and had he andall his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him, theycould not have found her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His auntdies.--He has only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote hishappiness.-- He had used every body ill--and they are all delighted toforgive him.-- He is a fortunate man indeed!"</p><p>"You speak as if you envied him."</p><p>"And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy."</p><p>Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence ofHarriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, ifpossible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totallydifferent--the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited forbreath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,</p><p>"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined, I see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but <i>I</i> cannot be wise. Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the next moment."</p><p>"Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it," she eagerly cried. "Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself."</p><p>"Thank you," said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not another syllable followed.</p><p>Emma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide inher-- perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she wouldlisten. She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; shemight give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his ownindependence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must bemore intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They hadreached the house.</p><p>"You are going in, I suppose?" said he.</p><p>"No,"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner inwhich he still spoke--"I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry isnot gone." And, after proceeding a few steps, she added-- "I stoppedyou ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave youpain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, orto ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation--as afriend, indeed, you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like. Iwill tell you exactly what I think."</p><p>"As a friend!"--repeated Mr. Knightley.--"Emma, that I fear is aword--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?-- I havegone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your offer--Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as afriend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?"</p><p>He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression of his eyes overpowered her.</p><p>"My dearest Emma," said he, "for dearest you will always be,whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, mostbeloved Emma--tell me at once. Say `No,' if it is to be said."-- Shecould really say nothing.--"You are silent," he cried, with greatanimation; "absolutely silent! at present I ask no more."</p><p>Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps themost prominent feeling.</p><p>"I cannot make speeches, Emma:" he soon resumed; and in a tone ofsuch sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerablyconvincing.--"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about itmore. But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--Ihave blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no otherwoman in England would have borne it.-- Bear with the truths I wouldtell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. Themanner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, Ihave been a very indifferent lover.-- But you understand me.--Yes, yousee, you understand my feelings-- and will return them if you can. Atpresent, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice."</p><p>While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all thewonderful velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing aword-- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to seethat Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, adelusion, as complete a delusion as any of her own--that Harriet wasnothing; that she was every thing herself; that what she had beensaying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of herown feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, herdiscouragement, had been all received as discouragement fromherself.--And not only was there time for these convictions, with alltheir glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to rejoice thatHarriet's secret had not escaped her, and to resolve that it need not,and should not.--It was all the service she could now render her poorfriend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might haveprompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself toHarriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two-- or even the moresimple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever,without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not marry them both,Emma had it not. She felt for Harriet, with pain and with contrition;but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that could beprobable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had led her friendastray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her judgmentwas as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever beenbefore, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal anddegrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.--She spoke then,on being so entreated.-- What did she say?--Just what she ought, ofcourse. A lady always does.-- She said enough to shew there need not bedespair--and to invite him to say more himself. He <i>had</i>despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to cautionand silence, as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun byrefusing to hear him.--The change had perhaps been somewhatsudden;--her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing theconversation which she had just put an end to, might be a littleextraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was soobliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.</p><p>Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any humandisclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a littledisguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though theconduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be verymaterial.-- Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relentingheart than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.</p><p>He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. Hehad followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He hadcome, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement,with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if sheallowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had beenthe work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on hisfeelings. The delightful assurance of her total indifference towardsFrank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him,had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affectionhimself;--but it had been no present hope--he had only, in themomentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told thatshe did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior hopes whichgradually opened were so much the more enchanting.-- The affection,which he had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, wasalready his!--Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughlydistressed state of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, thatit could bear no other name.</p><p><i>Her</i> change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to eachthe same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each thesame degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side, therehad been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even theexpectation, of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma, andjealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentimenthaving probably enlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy ofFrank Churchill that had taken him from the country.--The Box Hillparty had decided him on going away. He would save himself fromwitnessing again such permitted, encouraged attentions.--He had gone tolearn to be indifferent.-- But he had gone to a wrong place. There wastoo much domestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore tooamiable a form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma--differing onlyin those striking inferiorities, which always brought the other inbrilliancy before him, for much to have been done, even had his timebeen longer.--He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day afterday--till this very morning's post had conveyed the history of JaneFairfax.--Then, with the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he didnot scruple to feel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at alldeserving Emma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxietyfor her, that he could stay no longer. He had ridden home through therain; and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetestand best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, borethe discovery.</p><p>He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--He heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill'scharacter was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought ofFrank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort offellow.</p></span><span id = 262 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the housefrom what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hopefor a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite flutterof happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still begreater when the flutter should have passed away.</p><p>They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table-- howoften it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen on thesame shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of thewestern sun!--But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thinglike it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of herusual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentivedaughter.</p><p>Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him inthe breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and soanxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could hehave seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; butwithout the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without theslightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways ofeither, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of newshe had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with muchself-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told himin return.</p><p>As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised andsubdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the taxfor such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points toconsider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have somealloy. Her father--and Harriet. She could not be alone without feelingthe full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfortof both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father, itwas a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightleywould ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the mostsolemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over theidea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only anengagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the dangerof drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;-- how tospare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possibleatonement; how to appear least her enemy?-- On these subjects, herperplexity and distress were very great-- and her mind had to passagain and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret thathad ever surrounded it.-- She could only resolve at last, that shewould still avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need betold by letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have herremoved just now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one schememore-- nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get aninvitation for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased withHarriet; and a few weeks spent in London must give her someamusement.-- She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape beingbenefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and thechildren.-- At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindnessin herself, from whom every thing was due; a separation for thepresent; an averting of the evil day, when they must all be togetheragain.</p><p>She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment whichleft her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walkingup to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and halfan hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in aproper share of the happiness of the evening before.</p><p>He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to havethe slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letterwas brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed whatit must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.-- She wasnow in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted noexplanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself-- and asfor understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable ofit.--It must be waded through, however. She opened the packet; it wastoo surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in theletter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.</p><p>"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to youthe enclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and havescarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall nevermaterially disagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you bya long preface.--We are quite well.-- This letter has been the cure ofall the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quitelike your looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and thoughyou will never own being affected by weather, I think every body feelsa north-east wind.-- I felt for your dear father very much in the stormof Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort ofhearing last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.</p><div class="&quot;poem&quot;"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours ever,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A.

Mycourage rises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous tobe humble. I have already met with such success in two applications forpardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,and of those among your friends who have had any ground ofoffence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of mysituation when I first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me ashaving a secret which was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact.My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment, isanother question. I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to <i>think</i>it a right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windowsbelow, and casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address heropenly; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too wellknown to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail,before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright femalemind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.-- Hadshe refused, I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say,what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?-- Toany thing, every thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects,sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Everypossibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings secured,in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence. If you needfarther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being yourhusband's son, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hopefor good, which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal thevalue of.--See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on myfirst visit to Randalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong, for thatvisit might have been sooner paid. You will look back and see that Idid not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as <i>you</i> werethe person slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work onmy father's compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absentedmyself from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. Mybehaviour, during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, didnot, I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. Andnow I come to the principal, the only important part of my conductwhile belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires verysolicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the warmestfriendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think Iought to add, with the deepest humiliation.-- A few words which droppedfrom him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledgemyself liable to.--My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe,more than it ought.-- In order to assist a concealment so essential tome, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort ofintimacy into which we were immediately thrown.--I cannot deny thatMiss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but I am sure you will believethe declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, Iwould not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.-- Amiableand delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of ayoung woman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free fromany tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as mywish.--She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumouredplayfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand eachother. From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, andwere felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understandme before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;--when Icalled to take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment ofconfessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion;but I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at least in somedegree.-- She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness musthave penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever thesubject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not takeher wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. I rememberher telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for herattentions to Miss Fairfax.-- I hope this history of my conduct towardsher will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of whatyou saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against EmmaWoodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, andprocure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes ofthat said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherlyaffection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love asmyself.-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,you have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was toget my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say,that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who wouldnever have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.-- Thedelicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, ismuch beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestlyhope, know her thoroughly yourself.-- No description can describe her.She must tell you herself what she is-- yet not by word, for never wasthere a human creature who would so designedly suppress her ownmerit.--Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw,I have heard from her.-- She gives a good account of her own health;but as she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have youropinion of her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is livingin dread of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from youwithout delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember howfew minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state:and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness ormisery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of herexcellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and howlittle I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could butsee her again!--But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been toogood for me to encroach.--I must still add to this long letter. Youhave not heard all that you ought to hear. I could not give anyconnected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, theunseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation;for though the event of the 26th ult., as you will conclude,immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not havepresumed on such early measures, but from the very particularcircumstances, which left me not an hour to lose. I should myself haveshrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have felt every scrupleof mine with multiplied strength and refinement.-- But I had no choice.The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman--Here, mydear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly, to recollect andcompose myself.--I have been walking over the country, and am now, Ihope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought tobe.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect for me. I behavedshamefully. And here I can admit, that my manners to Miss W., in beingunpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable. <i>She</i> disapprovedthem, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of concealing the truthshe did not think sufficient.--She was displeased; I thoughtunreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarilyscrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold. But she was alwaysright. If I had followed her judgment, and subdued my spirits to thelevel of what she deemed proper, I should have escaped the greatestunhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.-- Do you remember themorning spent at Donwell?--<i>There</i> every little dissatisfactionthat had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late; I met herwalking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she would notsuffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then thoughtmost unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very naturaland consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the world to ourengagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity toanother woman, was she to be consenting the next to a proposal whichmight have made every previous caution useless?--Had we been metwalking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have beensuspected.-- I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted heraffection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provokedby such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, andsuch apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible forany woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form ofwords perfectly intelligible to me.-- In short, my dear madam, it was aquarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and I returned thesame evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till thenext morning, merely because I would be as angry with her as possible.Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled intime; but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I wentaway determined that she should make the first advances.--I shallalways congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Hadyou witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would everhave thought well of me again. Its effect upon her appears in theimmediate resolution it produced: as soon as she found I was reallygone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs.Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the bye, has everfilled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spiritof forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself; but,otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which thatwoman has known.-- `Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that I have notyet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you. Think,then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltonswith all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence ofimaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.--She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, andwrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.-- <i>She</i> <i>felt</i> <i>the</i> <i>engagement</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>a</i> <i>source</i> <i>of</i> <i>repentance</i> <i>and</i> <i>misery</i> <i>to</i> <i>each</i>: <i>she</i> <i>dissolved</i> <i>it</i>.--Thisletter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. Ianswered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and themultiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead ofbeing sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked upin my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, thoughbut a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--Iwas rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily;but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?-- toocheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor; and twodays afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters allreturned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating herextreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; andadding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued, andas it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinatearrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safeconveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directlycommand hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I wouldforward them after that period to her at--: in short, the fulldirection to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. Iknew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw whatshe had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution ofcharacter which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she hadmaintained, as to any such design in her former letter, was equallydescriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would not she haveseemed to threaten me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I hadactually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of thepost.-- What was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to myuncle. Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.--I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softenedaway his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man! witha deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in themarriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be of a differentsort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered inopening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?--No;do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her.Do not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.--I reached Highbury atthe time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, Iwas certain of a good chance of finding her alone.--I was notdisappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the objectof my journey. A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure Ihad to persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, muchdearer, than ever, and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between usagain. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not concludebefore. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you haveever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart willdictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier than Ideserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me the child ofgood fortune. I hope she is right.--In one respect, my good fortune isundoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,</p><div class="&quot;poem&quot;"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your obliged and affectionate Son,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.</p></div></span><span id = 264 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She was obliged,in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it allthe justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her ownname, it was irresistible; every line relating to herself wasinteresting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this charmceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the natural returnof her former regard for the writer, and the very strong attractionwhich any picture of love must have for her at that moment. She neverstopt till she had gone through the whole; and though it was impossiblenot to feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than shehad supposed--and he had suffered, and was very sorry--and he was sograteful to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and shewas so happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he haveentered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily asever.</p><p>She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley cameagain, she desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston'swishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr.Knightley, had seen so much to blame in his conduct.</p><p>"I shall be very glad to look it over," said he; "but it seems long. I will take it home with me at night."</p><p>But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she must return it by him.</p><p>"I would rather be talking to you," he replied; "but as it seems a matter of justice, it shall be done."</p><p>He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, "Had I beenoffered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to hismother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken withsuch indifference."</p><p>He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with asmile, observed, "Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is hisway. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not besevere."</p><p>"It will be natural for me," he added shortly afterwards, "to speakmy opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am nearyou. It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it--"</p><p>"Not at all. I should wish it."</p><p>Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.</p><p>"He trifles here," said he, "as to the temptation. He knows he iswrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to haveformed the engagement.--`His father's disposition:'-- he is unjust,however, to his father. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing onall his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned everypresent comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; he didnot come till Miss Fairfax was here."</p><p>"And I have not forgotten," said Emma, "how sure you were that hemight have come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely--but you were perfectly right."</p><p>"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think-- had <i>you</i> not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him."</p><p>When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole ofit aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of thehead; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, asthe subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steadyreflection, thus--</p><p>"Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a mostdangerous game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.-- Nojudge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his ownwishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.--Fancying you to have fathomed his secret. Natural enough!-- his ownmind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery;Finesse--how they pervert the understanding! My Emma, does not everything serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity inall our dealings with each other?"</p><p>Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account, which she could not give any sincere explanation of.</p><p>"You had better go on," said she.</p><p>He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, "the pianoforte! Ah!That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to considerwhether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed thepleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's wishingto give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would ratherdispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented theinstrument's coming if she could."</p><p>After this, he made some progress without any pause. FrankChurchill's confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thingto call for more than a word in passing.</p><p>"I perfectly agree with you, sir,"--was then his remark. "You didbehave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line." And having gonethrough what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement,and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's senseof right, he made a fuller pause to say, "This is very bad.--He hadinduced her to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extremedifficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object toprevent her from suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much moreto contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. Heshould have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such;but hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, andremember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to theengagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state ofpunishment."</p><p>Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grewuncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She wasdeeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fearof giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.</p><p>"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, theEltons," was his next observation.--"His feelings are natural.-- What!actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagementto be a source of repentance and misery to each-- she dissolvedit.--What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well, hemust be a most extraordinary--"</p><p>"Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers."</p><p>"I hope he does," replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter. "`Smallridge!'--What does this mean? What is all this?"</p><p>"She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by thebye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?"</p><p>"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even ofMrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letterthe man writes!"</p><p>"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him."</p><p>"Well, there <i>is</i> feeling here.--He does seem to have sufferedin finding her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fondof her. `Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope he may long continue tofeel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberalthanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than Ideserve.' Come, he knows himself there. `Miss Woodhouse calls me thechild of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, werethey?-- And a fine ending--and there is the letter. The child of goodfortune! That was your name for him, was it?"</p><p>"You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; butstill you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him forit. I hope it does him some service with you."</p><p>"Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults ofinconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinionin thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as heis, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, itmay be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I amvery ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hersthe steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let metalk to you of something else. I have another person's interest atpresent so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about FrankChurchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has beenhard at work on one subject."</p><p>The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlikeEnglish, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in lovewith, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking thehappiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word."While her dear father lived, any change of condition must beimpossible for her. She could never quit him." Part only of thisanswer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting herfather, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but theinadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to. He had beenthinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped toinduce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted tobelieve it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would notsuffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed hispersuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father'scomfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr.Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to beattempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, hetrusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as herfather's happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield tocontinue her home, it should be his likewise.</p><p>Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her ownpassing thoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it;but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her. She wassensible of all the affection it evinced. She felt that, in quittingDonwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hoursand habits; that in living constantly with her father, and in no houseof his own, there would be much, very much, to be borne with. Shepromised to think of it, and advised him to think of it more; but hewas fully convinced, that no reflection could alter his wishes or hisopinion on the subject. He had given it, he could assure her, very longand calm consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkinsthe whole morning, to have his thoughts to himself.</p><p>"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for," cried Emma. "I am sureWilliam Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before youask mine."</p><p>She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very goodscheme.</p><p>It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of viewin which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was neverstruck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights asheir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think shemust of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet sheonly gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusementin detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley'smarrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she hadwholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.</p><p>This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing atHartfield-- the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, theirmutual good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself inthe periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!-- Such a partnerin all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase ofmelancholy!</p><p>She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but everyblessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of herfriend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightfulfamily party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, inmere charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be aloser in every way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as anydeduction from her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would berather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, itseemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in sucha state of unmerited punishment.</p><p>In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;-- not likeMr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so trulyconsiderate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshippedthan now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that shecould be in love with more than <i>three</i> men in one year.</p></span><span id = 266 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous asherself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough byletter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!</p><p>Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, withoutreproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied therewas a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in herstyle, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- Itmight be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel onlycould have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.</p><p>She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and shewas fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, withoutresorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss. Harriet reallywished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. JohnKnightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was arecommendation to her--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr.Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When itwas thus settled on her sister's side, Emma proposed it to her friend,and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go; she was invitedfor at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse'scarriage.--It was all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet wassafe in Brunswick Square.</p><p>Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she couldtalk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that senseof injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had hauntedher when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how muchmight at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by thefeelings which she had led astray herself.</p><p>The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, madeperhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she couldnot think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.</p><p>She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to theplace in her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communicationbefore her, one which <i>she</i> only could be competent to make-- theconfession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothingto do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosuretill Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should bethrown at this period among those she loved-- and the evil should notact on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight,at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but moreagitating, delight, should be hers.</p><p>She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ halfan hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.-- Sheought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of theirpresent situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It wouldbe a <i>secret</i> satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarityof prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she shouldattend to any thing Jane might communicate.</p><p>She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but hadnot been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poorJane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fearof being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their beingat home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.-- She heardPatty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bateshad before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard nothing but theinstant reply of, "Beg her to walk up;"--and a moment afterwards shewas met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if noother reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen herlook so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness,animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance ormanner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand;and said, in a low, but very feeling tone,</p><p>"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for meto express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirelywithout words."</p><p>Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, ifthe sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checkedher, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all hercongratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.</p><p>Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, whichaccounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with everybody; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hopedthe rencontre would do them no harm.</p><p>She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, andunderstand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being inMiss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with whatwas still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediatelyin the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments toMrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, shesaw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter whichshe had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return itinto the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significantnods,</p><p>"We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall notwant opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essentialalready. I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology,and is not offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is asweet creature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.--But not aword more. Let us be discreet-- quite on our goodbehaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines-- I forget the poem at thismoment:</p><pre>       "For when a lady's in the case,<br />       "You know all other things give place."<br /></pre><p>Now I say, my dear, in <i>our</i> case, for <i>lady</i>, read----mum! a word to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--<i>My</i> representation, you see, has quite appeased her."</p><p>And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,</p><p>"I mentioned no <i>names</i>, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as a minister of state. I managed it extremely well."</p><p>Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on everypossible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmonyof the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressedwith,</p><p>"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here ischarmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highestcredit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon myword, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!-- Oh! if youhad seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!"-- And when Mrs.Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther, "We do not say aword of any <i>assistance</i> that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit."</p><p>"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse," sheshortly afterwards began, "since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasantparty. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did notseem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits ofsome.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However,I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say youboth to our collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again,while the fine weather lasts?-- It must be the same party, you know,quite the same party, not <i>one</i> exception."</p><p>Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help beingdiverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to sayevery thing.</p><p>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It isimpossible to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane'sprospects-- that is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.-- Such ahappy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.-- Charming youngman!--that is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!-- suchattention to Jane!"--And from her great, her more than commonlythankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed thatthere had been a little show of resentment towards Jane, from thevicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.-- After a fewwhispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speakinglouder, said,</p><p>"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, thatanywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truthis, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join mehere, and pay his respects to you."</p><p>"What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?-- Thatwill be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morningvisits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged."</p><p>"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morningto night.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretenceor other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, arealways wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing withouthim.--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than I.-- I donot know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I hadhalf so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I absolutelyneglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have notplayed a bar this fortnight.--However, he is coming, I assure you: yes,indeed, on purpose to wait on you all." And putting up her hand toscreen her words from Emma--"A congratulatory visit, you know.--Oh!yes, quite indispensable."</p><p>Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!--</p><p>"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himselffrom Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deepconsultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand."</p><p>Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, "Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk."</p><p>"Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston andCole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those wholead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way."</p><p>"Have not you mistaken the day?" said Emma. "I am almost certainthat the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley wasat Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday."</p><p>"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day," was the abrupt answer,which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--"I do believe," she continued, "this is the most troublesome parishthat ever was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove."</p><p>"Your parish there was small," said Jane.</p><p>"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject talked of."</p><p>"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heardyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children."</p><p>"Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking brainyou have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make,if we could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity wouldproduce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that <i>some</i> people may not think <i>you</i> perfection already.--But hush!-- not a word, if you please."</p><p>It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give herwords, not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainlysaw. The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, wasvery evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.</p><p>Mr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity.</p><p>"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be anencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!-- Butyou knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew Ishould not stir till my lord and master appeared.-- Here have I beensitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugalobedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?"</p><p>Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrownaway. His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but hissubsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he wassuffering, and the walk he had had for nothing.</p><p>"When I got to Donwell," said he, "Knightley could not be found.Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home tillone."</p><p>"Donwell!" cried his wife.--"My dear Mr. E., you have not been toDonwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown."</p><p>"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to seeKnightley to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broilingmorning!-- I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of greatill-usage,) which made it so much the worse. And then not to find himat home! I assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, nomessage for me. The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my beingexpected.-- Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way hewas gone. Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps intohis woods.-- Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friendKnightley!--Can you explain it?"</p><p>Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary, indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.</p><p>"I cannot imagine," said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as awife ought to do,) "I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing byyou, of all people in the world! The very last person whom one shouldexpect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a messagefor you, I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so veryeccentric;-- and his servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was thecase: and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I wouldnot have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for anyconsideration. And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheapindeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it."</p><p>"I met William Larkins," continued Mr. Elton, "as I got near thehouse, and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I didnot believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour. He did not knowwhat was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly everget the speech of him. I have nothing to do with William's wants, butit really is of very great importance that <i>I</i> should seeKnightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very seriousinconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose."</p><p>Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In allprobability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towardsMr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.</p><p>She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined toattend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave heran opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,</p><p>"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Hadyou not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted tointroduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than mighthave been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have beenimpertinent."</p><p>"Oh!" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thoughtinfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usualcomposure--"there would have been no danger. The danger would have beenof my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than byexpressing an interest--. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking morecollectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, verygreat misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that thoseof my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are notdisgusted to such a degree as to--I have not time for half that I couldwish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something formyself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if yourcompassion does not stand my friend--"</p><p>"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are," cried Emma warmly, andtaking her hand. "You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom youmight be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delightedeven--"</p><p>"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.-- Socold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life ofdeceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you."</p><p>"Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on myside. Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to bedone quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hopeyou have pleasant accounts from Windsor?"</p><p>"Very."</p><p>"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you-- just as I begin to know you."</p><p>"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."</p><p>"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps," replied Emma, smiling--"but, excuse me, it must be thought of."</p><p>The smile was returned as Jane answered,</p><p>"You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you,(I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr.Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, atleast, of deep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there willbe nothing more to wait for."</p><p>"Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assuredof.-- Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided andopen!-- Good-bye, good-bye."</p></span><span id = 268 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if thesatisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was byknowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided inwishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was withany view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either ofIsabella's sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit bothfather and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, ashe grew older-- and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten yearshence--to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense,the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; andMrs. Weston-- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her;and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how toteach, should not have their powers in exercise again.</p><p>"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me," shecontinued--"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, inMadame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her ownlittle Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan."</p><p>"That is," replied Mr. Knightley, "she will indulge her even morethan she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. Itwill be the only difference."</p><p>"Poor child!" cried Emma; "at that rate, what will become of her?"</p><p>"Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeablein infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all mybitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owingall my happiness to <i>you</i>, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them?"</p><p>Emma laughed, and replied: "But I had the assistance of all yourendeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubtwhether my own sense would have corrected me without it."</p><p>"Do you?--I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:-- MissTaylor gave you principles. You must have done well. My interferencewas quite as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you tosay, what right has he to lecture me?-- and I am afraid very naturalfor you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do notbelieve I did you any good. The good was all to myself, by making youan object of the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about youso much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancyingso many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteenat least."</p><p>"I am sure you were of use to me," cried Emma. "I was very ofteninfluenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time. I amvery sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to bespoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for heras you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she isthirteen."</p><p>"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one ofyour saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa saysI may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, you knew, I didnot approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two badfeelings instead of one."</p><p>"What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance."</p><p>"`Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and, fromhabit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal. I wantyou to call me something else, but I do not know what."</p><p>"I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable fits,about ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you;but, as you made no objection, I never did it again."</p><p>"And cannot you call me `George' now?"</p><p>"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.' Iwill not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, bycalling you Mr. K.--But I will promise," she added presently, laughingand blushing--"I will promise to call you once by your Christian name.I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building inwhich N. takes M. for better, for worse."</p><p>Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one importantservice which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advicewhich would have saved her from the worst of all her womanlyfollies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tendera subject.--She could not enter on it.-- Harriet was very seldommentioned between them. This, on his side, might merely proceed fromher not being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute itto delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that theirfriendship were declining. She was aware herself, that, parting underany other circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more,and that her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almostwholly did, on Isabella's letters. He might observe that it was so. Thepain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was verylittle inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.</p><p>Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could beexpected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to beconsulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appearto find Harriet different from what she had known her before.--Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet hadnot been equal to playing with the children, it would not have escapedher. Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, byHarriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a monthat least. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, andshe was invited to remain till they could bring her back.</p><p>"John does not even mention your friend," said Mr. Knightley. "Here is his answer, if you like to see it."</p><p>It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all aliveto know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearingthat her friend was unmentioned.</p><p>"John enters like a brother into my happiness," continued Mr.Knightley, "but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him tohave, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far frommaking flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rathercool in her praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes."</p><p>"He writes like a sensible man," replied Emma, when she had read theletter. "I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers thegood fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is notwithout hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, asyou think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a differentconstruction, I should not have believed him."</p><p>"My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means--"</p><p>"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,"interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--"much less, perhaps,than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve onthe subject."</p><p>"Emma, my dear Emma--"</p><p>"Oh!" she cried with more thorough gaiety, "if you fancy yourbrother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in thesecret, and hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much fartherfrom doing <i>you</i> justice. He will think all the happiness, allthe advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. Iwish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him at once.-- His tendercompassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther."</p><p>"Ah!" he cried, "I wish your father might be half as easilyconvinced as John will be, of our having every right that equal worthcan give, to be happy together. I am amused by one part of John'sletter-- did you notice it?--where he says, that my information did nottake him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation ofhearing something of the kind."</p><p>"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your havingsome thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectlyunprepared for that."</p><p>"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into myfeelings. What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of anydifference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at thistime for my marrying any more than at another.-- But it was so, Isuppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with themthe other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so muchas usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, `Uncle seemsalways tired now.'"</p><p>The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and otherpersons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficientlyrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view thather gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved firstto announce it at home, and then at Randalls.-- But how to break it toher father at last!--She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour ofMr. Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart wouldhave failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was tocome at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.--Shewas forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make ita more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits shecould command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could beobtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all-- she and Mr.Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive theconstant addition of that person's company whom she knew he loved, nextto his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.</p><p>Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he triedearnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, ofhaving always said she would never marry, and assured that it would bea great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poorIsabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do. Emma hung abouthim affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that hemust not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriagestaking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: butshe was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she wasintroducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for thebetter; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happierfor having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used tothe idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not denythat he did, she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult onbusiness but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him, who so ready towrite his letters, who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful, soattentive, so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always onthe spot?--Yes. That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not bethere too often; he should be glad to see him every day;--but they didsee him every day as it was.--Why could not they go on as they had done?</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst wasovercome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do therest.-- To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's,whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; andhe was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters ofthe strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the firstmeeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable light--first,as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one-- well aware of the nearlyequal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse'smind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom hewas used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness;and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began tothink that some time or other-- in another year or two, perhaps--itmight not be so very bad if the marriage did take place.</p><p>Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that shesaid to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but shesaw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple inurging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, asto think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respectso proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in onerespect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safelyhave attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herselfbeen the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished itlong ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emmawould have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such anarrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, fora marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombeand Hartfield had been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr.Weston than by herself--but even he had never been able to finish thesubject better than by saying--"Those matters will take care ofthemselves; the young people will find a way." But here there wasnothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It wasall right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth thename. It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, andwithout one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.</p><p>Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in suchreflections as these, was one of the happiest women in the world. Ifany thing could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the babywould soon have outgrown its first set of caps.</p><p>The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr.Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enoughto familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.-- He saw theadvantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy ofhis wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end ofan hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.</p><p>"It is to be a secret, I conclude," said he. "These matters arealways a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Onlylet me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has anysuspicion."</p><p>He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on thatpoint. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldestdaughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed,of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediatelyafterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; theyhad calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soonit would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as theevening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.</p><p>In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him,and others might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommendtheir all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the JohnKnightleys; and another might predict disagreements among theirservants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objectionraised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprizewas not softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it,compared with his wife; he only hoped "the young lady's pride would nowbe contented;" and supposed "she had always meant to catch Knightley ifshe could;" and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringlyexclaim, "Rather he than I!"-- But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposedindeed.--"Poor Knightley! poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She wasextremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand goodqualities.-- How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all inlove-- not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of allpleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dinewith them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.--Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for <i>her</i>.Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on everything.--Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that shehad abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan, livingtogether. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who hadtried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the firstquarter.</p></span><span id = 270 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from Londonwould be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking ofit one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieveher, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by.After the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a gravertone, began with,</p><p>"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news."</p><p>"Good or bad?" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.</p><p>"I do not know which it ought to be called."</p><p>"Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance. You are trying not to smile."</p><p>"I am afraid," said he, composing his features, "I am very much afraid, my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it."</p><p>"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too."</p><p>"There is one subject," he replied, "I hope but one, on which we donot think alike." He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyesfixed on her face. "Does nothing occur to you?-- Do not yourecollect?--Harriet Smith."</p><p>Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though she knew not what.</p><p>"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?" cried he. "You have, I believe, and know the whole."</p><p>"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me."</p><p>"You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."</p><p>Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared-- and hereyes, in eager gaze, said, "No, this is impossible!" but her lips wereclosed.</p><p>"It is so, indeed," continued Mr. Knightley; "I have it from Robert Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago."</p><p>She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.</p><p>"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinionswere the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will makeone or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, weneed not talk much on the subject."</p><p>"You mistake me, you quite mistake me," she replied, exertingherself. "It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,but I cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean tosay, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot meanthat he has even proposed to her again--yet. You only mean, that heintends it."</p><p>"I mean that he has done it," answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but determined decision, "and been accepted."</p><p>"Good God!" she cried.--"Well!"--Then having recourse to herworkbasket, in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all theexquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she mustbe expressing, she added, "Well, now tell me every thing; make thisintelligible to me. How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never wasmore surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assureyou.--How--how has it been possible?"</p><p>"It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three daysago, and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting tosend to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, andwas asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's. Theywere going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to beour brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. My friend Robertcould not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremelyamused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day--whichhe did--and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found anopportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak invain.--She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he isdeserving. He came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me thismorning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, firston my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate ofthe how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longerhistory when you see her.-- She will give you all the minuteparticulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.--In ourcommunications we deal only in the great.--However, I must say, thatRobert Martin's heart seemed for <i>him</i>, and to <i>me</i>, veryoverflowing; and that he did mention, without its being much to thepurpose, that on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took chargeof Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smithand Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to makeMiss Smith rather uneasy."</p><p>He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak,she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree ofhappiness. She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Hersilence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added,</p><p>"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now makeyou unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.His situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfiesyour friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better ofhim as you know him more. His good sense and good principles woulddelight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish yourfriend in better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could,which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me aboutWilliam Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin."</p><p>He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,</p><p>"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think Harriet is doing extremely well. <i>Her</i> connexions may be worse than <i>his</i>.In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are. Ihave been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You cannotimagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared Iwas!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determinedagainst him, much more, than she was before."</p><p>"You ought to know your friend best," replied Mr. Knightley; "but Ishould say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to bevery, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her."</p><p>Emma could not help laughing as she answered, "Upon my word, Ibelieve you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, areyou perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright <i>accepted</i>him. I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?-- Did notyou misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things; ofbusiness, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in theconfusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not Harriet's handthat he was certain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox."</p><p>The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley andRobert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and sostrong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed onHarriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with suchemphasis, "No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,"that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in somemeasure, premature. It could not be otherwise.</p><p>"Do you dare say this?" cried Mr. Knightley. "Do you dare to supposeme so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--What do you deserve?"</p><p>"Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put upwith any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, directanswer. Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr.Martin and Harriet now are?"</p><p>"I am quite sure," he replied, speaking very distinctly, "that hetold me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothingdoubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof thatit must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knewof no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information ofher relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to bedone, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then,he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day."</p><p>"I am perfectly satisfied," replied Emma, with the brightest smiles, "and most sincerely wish them happy."</p><p>"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before."</p><p>"I hope so--for at that time I was a fool."</p><p>"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you allHarriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, andfor Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe asmuch in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I haveoften talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did.Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me ofpleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from allmy observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing herhappiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much ofthis, I have no doubt, she may thank you for."</p><p>"Me!" cried Emma, shaking her head.--"Ah! poor Harriet!"</p><p>She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved.</p><p>Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of herfather. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in astate of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to becollected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and tillshe had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected,she could be fit for nothing rational.</p><p>Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to putthe horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; andshe had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.</p><p>The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations maybe imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospectof Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happyfor security.--What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow moreworthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superiorto her own. Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teachher humility and circumspection in future.</p><p>Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in herresolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in thevery midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of thedoleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a Harriet!</p><p>Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would be apleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.</p><p>High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, wasthe reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightleywould soon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful toher to practise, might soon be over. She could now look forward togiving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition wasmost ready to welcome as a duty.</p><p>In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whetherin speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of hisbeing obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would bedisappointed.</p><p>They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:-- buthardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received thethanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caughtthrough the blind, of two figures passing near the window.</p><p>"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax," said Mrs. Weston. "I was just goingto tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive thismorning. He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuadedto spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope."</p><p>In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad tosee him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassingrecollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with aconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having allsat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle,that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she hadlong felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him withJane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joinedthe party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longera want of subject or animation-- or of courage and opportunity forFrank Churchill to draw near her and say,</p><p>"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgivingmessage in one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made youless willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said."</p><p>"No, indeed," cried Emma, most happy to begin, "not in the least. Iam particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give youjoy in person."</p><p>He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.</p><p>"Is not she looking well?" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane."Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs.Weston doat upon her."</p><p>But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named thename of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in herhearing.</p><p>"I can never think of it," she cried, "without extreme shame."</p><p>"The shame," he answered, "is all mine, or ought to be. But is itpossible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, I know, youhad none."</p><p>"I never had the smallest, I assure you."</p><p>"That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near--and I wish Ihad-- it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrongthings, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me noservice.-- It would have been a much better transgression had I brokenthe bond of secrecy and told you every thing."</p><p>"It is not now worth a regret," said Emma.</p><p>"I have some hope," resumed he, "of my uncle's being persuaded topay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When theCampbells are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continuethere, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now, I am at sucha distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?-- Till thismorning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do notyou pity me?"</p><p>Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay thought, he cried,</p><p>"Ah! by the bye," then sinking his voice, and looking demure for themoment--"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?" He paused.--She coloured andlaughed.--"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wishin your favour. Let me return your congratulations.-- I assure you thatI have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--Heis a man whom I cannot presume to praise."</p><p>Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his ownJane, and his next words were,</p><p>"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--and yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair. It is amost uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair-- a mostdistinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.-- Just colourenough for beauty."</p><p>"I have always admired her complexion," replied Emma, archly; "butdo not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being sopale?-- When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?"</p><p>"Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--"</p><p>But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help saying,</p><p>"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am sure it was a consolation to you."</p><p>"Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most miserable wretch!"</p><p>"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure itwas a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were takingus all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell youthe truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in thesame situation. I think there is a little likeness between us."</p><p>He bowed.</p><p>"If not in our dispositions," she presently added, with a look oftrue sensibility, "there is a likeness in our destiny; the destinywhich bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior toour own."</p><p>"True, true," he answered, warmly. "No, not true on your side. Youcan have no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel.Look at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn ofher throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.-- Youwill be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels. They are to benew set. I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Willnot it be beautiful in her dark hair?"</p><p>"Very beautiful, indeed," replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that he gratefully burst out,</p><p>"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in suchexcellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. Ishould certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come."</p><p>The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving anaccount of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, fromthe infant's appearing not quite well. She believed she had beenfoolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minuteof sending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr.Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however,the child had been perfectly well again. This was her history; andparticularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended hervery much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted thatshe had not done it. "She should always send for Perry, if the childappeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment.She could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It wasa pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the childseemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have beenbetter if Perry had seen it."</p><p>Frank Churchill caught the name.</p><p>"Perry!" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch MissFairfax's eye. "My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travelnow?--Has he set up his carriage?"</p><p>Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined inthe laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too wasreally hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.</p><p>"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!" he cried. "I can never thinkof it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. Isee it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her.Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her ownletter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye-- that thewhole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to nothingelse, though pretending to listen to the others?"</p><p>Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smilepartly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,low, yet steady voice,</p><p>"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!-- They <i>will</i> sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!"</p><p>He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; butEmma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leavingRandalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, shefelt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and reallyregarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been moresensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. Thehappiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in theanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.</p></span><span id = 272 ><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, amomentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of herattachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man fromunbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from therecurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the partyfrom London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one houralone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountableas it was!-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr.Knightley, and was now forming all her views of happiness.</p><p>Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, andself-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away withthe words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with thefullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend'sapprobation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, bymeeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.-- Harriet wasmost happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and thedinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.But what did such particulars explain?-- The fact was, as Emma couldnow acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and thathis continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it mustever be unintelligible to Emma.</p><p>The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving herfresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known. Sheproved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her thecomfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough tohave always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentilitywhich Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely tobe as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what aconnexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for theChurchills--or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy,unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.</p><p>No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man wastreated liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma becameacquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, shefully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth whichcould bid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet'shappiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home heoffered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, andimprovement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, andoccupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led intotemptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectableand happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in theworld, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such aman;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.</p><p>Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.-- Theintimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must changeinto a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, andmust be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, naturalmanner.</p><p>Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, andsaw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood beforethem, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr.Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fallon herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engagedof the three, were the first to be married.</p><p>Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to thecomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchillswere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.</p><p>The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriageought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, whichwas the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreedin approving it. But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse to be inducedto consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as adistant event.</p><p>When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that theywere almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.-- Hebegan to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it-- a verypromising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however,he was not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that hisdaughter's courage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, toknow him fancying himself neglected; and though her understandingalmost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, thatwhen once the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, shehesitated--she could not proceed.</p><p>In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any suddenillumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of hisnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in anotherway.-- Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all herturkeys-- evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in theneighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was <i>housebreaking</i> toMr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense ofhis son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm everynight of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind ofthe Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either ofthem protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.-- But Mr. JohnKnightley must be in London again by the end of the first week inNovember.</p><p>The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at themoment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was calledon, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, tojoin the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.</p><p>The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the partieshave no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from theparticulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,and very inferior to her own.--"Very little white satin, very few laceveils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard ofit."--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, theconfidence, the predictions of the small band of true friends whowitnessed the ceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness ofthe union.</p><p><br />FINIS</p></span>
