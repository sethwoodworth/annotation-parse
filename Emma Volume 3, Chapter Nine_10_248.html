<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Nine</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were notinterrupted; but on entering the parlour, she found those who mustrouse her. Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence,and were sitting with her father.&mdash;Mr. Knightley immediately got up,and in a manner decidedly graver than usual, said,</p><p>"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time tospare, and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London,to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to sendor say, besides the `love,' which nobody carries?"</p><p>"Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?"</p><p>"Yes&mdash;rather&mdash;I have been thinking of it some little time."</p><p>Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to befriends again. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going&mdash; herfather began his inquiries.</p><p>"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?&mdash;And how did you findmy worthy old friend and her daughter?&mdash;I dare say they must have beenvery much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs.and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always soattentive to them!"</p><p>Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with asmile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.Knightley.&mdash; It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression inher favour, as if his eyes received the truth from her's, and all thathad passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.&mdash;He looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified&mdash; andin another moment still more so, by a little movement of more thancommon friendliness on his part.&mdash;He took her hand;&mdash; whether she hadnot herself made the first motion, she could not say&mdash; she might,perhaps, have rather offered it&mdash;but he took her hand, pressed it, andcertainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips&mdash; when, from somefancy or other, he suddenly let it go.&mdash;Why he should feel such ascruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done, shecould not perceive.&mdash;He would have judged better, she thought, if hehad not stopped.&mdash;The intention, however, was indubitable; and whetherit was that his manners had in general so little gallantry, or howeverelse it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.&mdash; It waswith him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.&mdash; She could not butrecall the attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfectamity.&mdash;He left them immediately afterwards&mdash; gone in a moment. Healways moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither beundecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden than usual in hisdisappearance.</p><p>Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wishedshe had left her ten minutes earlier;&mdash;it would have been a greatpleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.&mdash;Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square,for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed&mdash;but it might havehappened at a better time&mdash;and to have had longer notice of it, wouldhave been pleasanter.&mdash;They parted thorough friends, however; she couldnot be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and hisunfinished gallantry;&mdash;it was all done to assure her that she had fullyrecovered his good opinion.&mdash;He had been sitting with them half anhour, she found. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!</p><p>In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from thedisagreeableness of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going sosuddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on theeffect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,&mdash; interested,without disturbing him. He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax'sgoing out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr.Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.</p><p>"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be socomfortably settled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, andI dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope itis a dry situation, and that her health will be taken good care of. Itought to be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always waswith me. You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady whatMiss Taylor was to us. And I hope she will be better off in onerespect, and not be induced to go away after it has been her home solong."</p><p>The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thingelse into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announcethe death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particularreason to hasten back on her account, she had not lived abovesix-and-thirty hours after his return. A sudden seizure of a differentnature from any thing foreboded by her general state, had carried heroff after a short struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.</p><p>It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree ofgravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for thesurviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know whereshe would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoopsto folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to bedisagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, wasnow spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fullyjustified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. Theevent acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness ofimaginary complaints.</p><p>"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:more than any body had ever supposed&mdash;and continual pain would try thetemper. It was a sad event&mdash;a great shock&mdash;with all her faults, whatwould Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's loss would bedreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it."&mdash; Even Mr.Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, "Ah! poor woman,who would have thought it!" and resolved, that his mourning should beas handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising overher broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady.How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. Itwas also a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs.Churchill, the grief of her husband&mdash;her mind glanced over them bothwith awe and compassion&mdash;and then rested with lightened feelings on howFrank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She sawin a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smithwould have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of hiswife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded intoany thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that thenephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in thecause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.</p><p>Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with greatself-command. What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayednothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her ofstrengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that mightendanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill'sdeath with mutual forbearance.</p><p>Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicatingall that was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr.Churchill was better than could be expected; and their first removal,on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the houseof a very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had beenpromising a visit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing tobe done for Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yetbe possible on Emma's side.</p><p>It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax,whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whoseengagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wishedto shew her kindness&mdash;and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. Shehad scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness; and theperson, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now the veryone on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard orsympathy. She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew a value forher society, and testify respect and consideration. She resolved toprevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urgeit. The invitation was refused, and by a verbal message. "Miss Fairfaxwas not well enough to write;" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield,the same morning, it appeared that she was so much indisposed as tohave been visited, though against her own consent, by himself, and thatshe was suffering under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to adegree, which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs.Smallridge's at the time proposed. Her health seemed for the momentcompletely deranged&mdash; appetite quite gone&mdash;and though there were noabsolutely alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint,which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasyabout her. He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to,and that she felt it so herself, though she would not own it. Herspirits seemed overcome. Her present home, he could not but observe,was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:&mdash; confined always to oneroom;&mdash;he could have wished it otherwise&mdash; and her good aunt, thoughhis very old friend, he must acknowledge to be not the best companionfor an invalid of that description. Her care and attention could not bequestioned; they were, in fact, only too great. He very much fearedthat Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them. Emma listenedwith the warmest concern; grieved for her more and more, and lookedaround eager to discover some way of being useful. To take her&mdash;be itonly an hour or two&mdash;from her aunt, to give her change of air andscene, and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two, mightdo her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say, in themost feeling language she could command, that she would call for her inthe carriage at any hour that Jane would name&mdash; mentioning that she hadMr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour of such exercise for hispatient. The answer was only in this short note:</p><p>"Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any exercise."</p><p>Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but itwas impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewedindisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might bestcounteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of theanswer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's,in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her&mdash; but it would notdo;&mdash;Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeingwith her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatestservice&mdash;and every thing that message could do was tried&mdash; but all invain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quiteunpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make herworse.&mdash;Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appearthat she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in."Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see anybody&mdash;any body at all&mdash; Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied&mdash;andMrs. Cole had made such a point&mdash;and Mrs. Perry had said so much&mdash;but,except them, Jane would really see nobody."</p><p>Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs.Perrys, and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;neither could she feel any right of preference herself&mdash; she submitted,therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece'sappetite and diet, which she longed to be able to assist. On thatsubject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy, and very communicative; Janewould hardly eat any thing:&mdash; Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food;but every thing they could command (and never had any body such goodneighbours) was distasteful.</p><p>Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to anexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior qualitywas speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. Inhalf an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks fromMiss Bates, but "dear Jane would not be satisfied without its beingsent back; it was a thing she could not take&mdash;and, moreover, sheinsisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing."</p><p>When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wanderingabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon ofthe very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to anyexercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,she could have no doubt&mdash;putting every thing together&mdash; that Jane wasresolved to receive no kindness from <i>her</i>. She was sorry, verysorry. Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the morepitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency ofaction, and inequality of powers; and it mortified her that she wasgiven so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthyas a friend: but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentionswere good, and of being able to say to herself, that could Mr.Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting JaneFairfax, could he even have seen into her heart, he would not, on thisoccasion, have found any thing to reprove.</p></body>
