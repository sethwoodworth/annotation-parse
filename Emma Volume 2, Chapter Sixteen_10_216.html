<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Sixteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, wasdisposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties andevening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowedin so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they werenever to have a disengaged day.</p><p>"I see how it is," said she. "I see what a life I am to lead amongyou. Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seemquite the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing veryformidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not adisengaged day!&mdash;A woman with fewer resources than I have, need nothave been at a loss."</p><p>No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits madeevening-parties perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given hera taste for dinners. She was a little shocked at the want of twodrawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being noice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddardand others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, butshe would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged. In thecourse of the spring she must return their civilities by one verysuperior party&mdash;in which her card-tables should be set out with theirseparate candles and unbroken packs in the true style&mdash;and more waitersengaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish, tocarry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in theproper order.</p><p>Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner atHartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or sheshould be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitifulresentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it forten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made theusual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.</p><p>The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides theEltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all ofcourse&mdash; and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harrietmust be asked to make the eighth:&mdash;but this invitation was not givenwith equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularlypleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it. "She wouldrather not be in his company more than she could help. She was not yetquite able to see him and his charming happy wife together, withoutfeeling uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, shewould rather stay at home." It was precisely what Emma would havewished, had she deemed it possible enough for wishing. She wasdelighted with the fortitude of her little friend&mdash;for fortitude sheknew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home; andshe could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make theeighth, Jane Fairfax.&mdash; Since her last conversation with Mrs. Westonand Mr. Knightley, she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfaxthan she had often been.&mdash;Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her. He hadsaid that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobodyelse paid her.</p><p>"This is very true," said she, "at least as far as relates to me,which was all that was meant&mdash;and it is very shameful.&mdash;Of the sameage&mdash; and always knowing her&mdash;I ought to have been more her friend.&mdash;She will never like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I willshew her greater attention than I have done."</p><p>Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and allhappy.&mdash; The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yetover. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest littleKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of someweeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, andstaying one whole day at Hartfield&mdash;which one day would be the very dayof this party.&mdash;His professional engagements did not allow of his beingput off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happeningso. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as theutmost that his nerves could bear&mdash; and here would be a ninth&mdash;and Emmaapprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at notbeing able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours withoutfalling in with a dinner-party.</p><p>She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, byrepresenting that though he certainly would make them nine, yet healways said so little, that the increase of noise would be veryimmaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, tohave him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to herinstead of his brother.</p><p>The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. JohnKnightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town andmust be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in theevening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and thephilosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed thechief of even Emma's vexation.</p><p>The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. JohnKnightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of beingagreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while theywaited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, aselegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence&mdash;wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information&mdash;but MissFairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk toher. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walkwith his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It wasnatural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,</p><p>"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I amsure you must have been wet.&mdash;We scarcely got home in time. I hope youturned directly."</p><p>"I went only to the post-office," said she, "and reached home beforethe rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letterswhen I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. Awalk before breakfast does me good."</p><p>"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine."</p><p>"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out."</p><p>Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,</p><p>"That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not sixyards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; andHenry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When youhave lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worthgoing through the rain for."</p><p>There was a little blush, and then this answer,</p><p>"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst ofevery dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simplygrowing older should make me indifferent about letters."</p><p>"Indifferent! Oh! no&mdash;I never conceived you could becomeindifferent. Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generallya very positive curse."</p><p>"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of friendship."</p><p>"I have often thought them the worst of the two," replied he coolly."Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does."</p><p>"Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well&mdash; Iam very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as anybody. I can easily believe that letters are very little to you, muchless than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myselfwhich makes the difference, it is not age, but situation. You haveevery body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shallagain; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, apost-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out, in worseweather than to-day."</p><p>"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress ofyears," said John Knightley, "I meant to imply the change of situationwhich time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Timewill generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within thedaily circle&mdash;but that is not the change I had in view for you. As anold friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten yearshence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have."</p><p>It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant"thank you" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip,a tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Herattention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to hiscustom on such occasions, making the circle of his guests, and payinghis particular compliments to the ladies, was ending with her&mdash;and withall his mildest urbanity, said,</p><p>"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out thismorning in the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.&mdash;Young ladies are delicate plants. They should take care of their healthand their complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?"</p><p>"Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me."</p><p>"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.&mdash;I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my veryold friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. Youdo us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I areboth highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatestsatisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield."</p><p>The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel thathe had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.</p><p>By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.</p><p>"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?&mdash;Going to the post-office in therain!&mdash;This must not be, I assure you.&mdash;You sad girl, how could you dosuch a thing?&mdash;It is a sign I was not there to take care of you."</p><p>Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.</p><p>"Oh! do not tell <i>me</i>. You really are a very sad girl, and donot know how to take care of yourself.&mdash;To the post-office indeed! Mrs.Weston, did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert ourauthority."</p><p>"My advice," said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, "I certainlydo feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.&mdash;Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to beparticularly careful, especially at this time of year. The spring Ialways think requires more than common care. Better wait an hour ortwo, or even half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringingon your cough again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sureyou are much too reasonable. You look as if you would not do such athing again."</p><p>"Oh! she <i>shall</i> <i>not</i> do such a thing again," eagerlyrejoined Mrs. Elton. "We will not allow her to do such a thingagain:"&mdash; and nodding significantly&mdash;"there must be some arrangementmade, there must indeed. I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetchesour letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name) shallinquire for yours too and bring them to you. That will obviate alldifficulties you know; and from <i>us</i> I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation."</p><p>"You are extremely kind," said Jane; "but I cannot give up my earlywalk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walksomewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I havescarcely ever had a bad morning before."</p><p>"My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, thatis (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thingwithout the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flattermyself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If Imeet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point assettled."</p><p>"Excuse me," said Jane earnestly, "I cannot by any means consent tosuch an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If theerrand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always iswhen I am not here, by my grandmama's."</p><p>"Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!&mdash;And it is a kindness to employ our men."</p><p>Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.</p><p>"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!" said she.&mdash; "Theregularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!"</p><p>"It is certainly very well regulated."</p><p>"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that aletter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about thekingdom, is even carried wrong&mdash;and not one in a million, I suppose,actually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of badhands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder."</p><p>"The clerks grow expert from habit.&mdash;They must begin with somequickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you wantany farther explanation," continued he, smiling, "they are paid for it.That is the key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and mustbe served well."</p><p>The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual observations made.</p><p>"I have heard it asserted," said John Knightley, "that the same sortof handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same masterteaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imaginethe likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys havevery little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any handthey can get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. Ihave not always known their writing apart."</p><p>"Yes," said his brother hesitatingly, "there is a likeness. I know what you mean&mdash;but Emma's hand is the strongest."</p><p>"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully," said Mr. Woodhouse; "andalways did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston"&mdash;with half a sigh and half asmile at her.</p><p>"I never saw any gentleman's handwriting"&mdash;Emma began, looking alsoat Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston wasattending to some one else&mdash;and the pause gave her time to reflect,"Now, how am I going to introduce him?&mdash;Am I unequal to speaking hisname at once before all these people? Is it necessary for me to use anyroundabout phrase?&mdash;Your Yorkshire friend&mdash; your correspondent inYorkshire;&mdash;that would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.&mdash;No,I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress. I certainly getbetter and better.&mdash;Now for it."</p><p>Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again&mdash;"Mr. Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw."</p><p>"I do not admire it," said Mr. Knightley. "It is too small&mdash; wants strength. It is like a woman's writing."</p><p>This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated himagainst the base aspersion. "No, it by no means wanted strength&mdash; itwas not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs.Weston any letter about her to produce?" No, she had heard from himvery lately, but having answered the letter, had put it away.</p><p>"If we were in the other room," said Emma, "if I had mywriting-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note ofhis.&mdash; Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for youone day?"</p><p>"He chose to say he was employed"&mdash;</p><p>"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley."</p><p>"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill," said Mr.Knightley dryly, "writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will,of course, put forth his best."</p><p>Dinner was on table.&mdash;Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, wasready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to beallowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying&mdash;</p><p>"Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way."</p><p>Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escapedEmma. She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to knowwhether the wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspectedthat it <i>had</i>; that it would not have been so resolutelyencountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear,and that it had not been in vain. She thought there was an air ofgreater happiness than usual&mdash;a glow both of complexion and spirits.</p><p>She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and theexpense of the Irish mails;&mdash;it was at her tongue's end&mdash; but sheabstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that shouldhurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies out ofthe room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becomingto the beauty and grace of each.</p></body>
