<p><br clear="&quot;&quot;all&quot;&quot;" /></p> <p>Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideasonly varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a gooddeal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearingFrank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure thanever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, howwere his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of hiscoming to Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she couldnot admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to beless disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy andcheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to havefaults; and farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she satdrawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progressand close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, andinventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginarydeclaration on his side was that she <i>refused</i> <i>him</i>. Theiraffection was always to subside into friendship. Every thing tender andcharming was to mark their parting; but still they were to part. Whenshe became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be verymuch in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determinationnever to quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainlymust produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her ownfeelings.</p> <p>"I do not find myself making any use of the word <i>sacrifice</i>,"said she.&mdash; "In not one of all my clever replies, my delicatenegatives, is there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspectthat he is not really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. Icertainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quiteenough in love. I should be sorry to be more."</p> <p>Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.</p> <p>"<i>He</i> is undoubtedly very much in love&mdash;every thing denotesit&mdash;very much in love indeed!&mdash;and when he comes again, if hisaffection continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.&mdash;Itwould be most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite madeup. Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging himhitherto. No, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, hewould not have been so wretched. Could he have thought himselfencouraged, his looks and language at parting would have beendifferent.&mdash; Still, however, I must be on my guard. This is in thesupposition of his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do notknow that I expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sortof man&mdash; I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.&mdash;His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.&mdash;Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful that myhappiness is not more deeply involved.&mdash;I shall do very well againafter a little while&mdash;and then, it will be a good thing over; for theysay every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall have beenlet off easily."</p> <p>When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it;and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made herat first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she hadundervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, givingthe particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all theaffection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, anddescribing every thing exterior and local that could be supposedattractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now ofapology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrastbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life wasjust enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how muchmore might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.&mdash;Thecharm of her own name was not wanting. <i>Miss</i> <i>Woodhouse</i>appeared more than once, and never without a something of pleasingconnexion, either a compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of whatshe had said; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye,unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yetcould discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatestcompliment perhaps of all conveyed. Compressed into the very lowestvacant corner were these words&mdash;"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday,as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend. Pray make myexcuses and adieus to her." This, Emma could not doubt, was all forherself. Harriet was remembered only from being <i>her</i> friend. Hisinformation and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor betterthan had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he darednot yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randallsagain.</p> <p>Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in thematerial part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up andreturned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, thatshe could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to dowithout her. Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusalonly grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for hissubsequent consolation and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, andthe words which clothed it, the "beautiful little friend," suggested toher the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. Was itimpossible?&mdash;No.&mdash;Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior inunderstanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness ofher face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all theprobabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.&mdash;ForHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.</p> <p>"I must not dwell upon it," said she.&mdash;"I must not think of it. Iknow the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger thingshave happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now,it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of truedisinterested friendship which I can already look forward to withpleasure."</p> <p>It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, thoughit might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in thatquarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr.Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latestinterest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon FrankChurchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the mostirresistible form.&mdash;His wedding-day was named. He would soon be amongthem again; Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk overthe first letter from Enscombe before "Mr. Elton and his bride" was inevery body's mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sickat the sound. She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr.Elton; and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had beenlately gaining strength. With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, therehad been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was nowtoo evident that she had not attained such a state of composure ascould stand against the actual approach&mdash;new carriage, bell-ringing,and all.</p> <p>Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all thereasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma couldgive. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriethad a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavywork to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for everagreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harrietlistened submissively, and said "it was very true&mdash; it was just as MissWoodhouse described&mdash;it was not worth while to think about them&mdash;andshe would not think about them any longer" but no change of subjectcould avail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restlessabout the Eltons as before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.</p> <p>"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make <i>me</i>.You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. Itwas all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assureyou.&mdash;Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you&mdash; and it willbe a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger offorgetting it."</p> <p>Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation. Emma continued,</p> <p>"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less,talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, Iwould wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important thanmy comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what isyour duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid thesuspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore yourtranquillity. These are the motives which I have been pressing on you.They are very important&mdash;and sorry I am that you cannot feel themsufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain is a verysecondary consideration. I want you to save yourself from greater pain.Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget whatwas due&mdash;or rather what would be kind by me."</p> <p>This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The ideaof wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom shereally loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when theviolence of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough toprompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably.</p> <p>"You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life&mdash; Wantgratitude to you!&mdash;Nobody is equal to you!&mdash;I care for nobody as I dofor you!&mdash;Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!"</p> <p>Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look andmanner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet sowell, nor valued her affection so highly before.</p> <p>"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart," said sheafterwards to herself. "There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmthand tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beatall the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure itwill. It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generallybeloved&mdash;which gives Isabella all her popularity.&mdash; I have it not&mdash;butI know how to prize and respect it.&mdash;Harriet is my superior in all thecharm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!&mdash;I would not changeyou for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging femalebreathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!&mdash;Harriet is worth ahundred such&mdash;And for a wife&mdash; a sensible man's wife&mdash;it is invaluable.I mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!"</p></body>
