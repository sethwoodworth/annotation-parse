<p><br clear="&quot;&quot;all&quot;&quot;" /></p> <p>No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The dayapproached, the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxiouswatching, Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self,reached Randalls before dinner, and every thing was safe.</p> <p>No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The roomat the Crown was to witness it;&mdash;but it would be better than a commonmeeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in hisentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfortof the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refusehim, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man'scompany. She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in goodtime, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.</p> <p>Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he didnot say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightfulevening. They all walked about together, to see that every thing was asit should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents ofanother carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first,without great surprize. "So unreasonably early!" she was going toexclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends,who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr.Weston's judgment; and they were so very closely followed by anothercarriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the samedistinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as ifhalf the company might soon be collected together for the purpose ofpreparatory inspection.</p> <p>Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr.Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of aman who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very firstdistinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but alittle less of open-heartedness would have made him a highercharacter.&mdash;General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a manwhat he ought to be.&mdash; She could fancy such a man. The whole partywalked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothingelse to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe intheir various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though <i>May</i>, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.</p> <p>Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number ofprivy councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates'sdoor to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were tobe brought by the Eltons.</p> <p>Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was arestlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, hewas going to the door, he was watching for the sound of othercarriages,&mdash; impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.</p> <p>Mrs. Elton was spoken of. "I think she must be here soon," said he."I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much ofher. It cannot be long, I think, before she comes."</p> <p>A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back, said,</p> <p>"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have neverseen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myselfforward."</p> <p>Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.</p> <p>"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking about. "We thought you were to bring them."</p> <p>The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now.Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be;how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and hersmiles of graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to forman opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the introductionhad passed.</p> <p>In a few minutes the carriage returned.&mdash;Somebody talked of rain.&mdash;"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir," said Frank to his father:"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:" and away he went. Mr. Weston wasfollowing; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinionof his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.</p> <p>"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly toldyou I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I amextremely pleased with him.&mdash;You may believe me. I never compliment. Ithink him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely whatI like and approve&mdash;so truly the gentleman, without the least conceitor puppyism. You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies&mdash; quite ahorror of them. They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr.Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimesto say very cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, borewith them much better."</p> <p>While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; butwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladiesjust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.</p> <p>Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. "I have no doubt of its being ourcarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are soextremely expeditious!&mdash;I believe we drive faster than any body.&mdash; Whata pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!&mdash; I understandyou were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quiteunnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of <i>them</i>."</p> <p>Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walkedinto the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty asMrs. Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might beunderstood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, everybody's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates,who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutesafter her being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the dooropened she was heard,</p> <p>"So very obliging of you!&mdash;No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I donot care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares&mdash; Well!&mdash;(assoon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!&mdash;Thisis admirable!&mdash;Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting.Could not have imagined it.&mdash;So well lighted up!&mdash; Jane, Jane,look!&mdash;did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really havehad Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again.I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance. `Oh! Mrs.Stokes,' said I&mdash; but I had not time for more." She was now met by Mrs.Weston.&mdash; "Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well.Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headache!&mdash; seeingyou pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you forthe carriage!&mdash;excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep thehorses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.&mdash; Oh! and I am sure ourthanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had mostkindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.&mdash; But two such offersin one day!&mdash;Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, `Upon myword, ma'am&mdash;.' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr.Woodhouse's. I made her take her shawl&mdash;for the evenings are notwarm&mdash;her large new shawl&mdash; Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.&mdash;So kind ofher to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know&mdash;Mr. Dixon'schoice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated aboutsome time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane,are you sure you did not wet your feet?&mdash;It was but a drop or two, butI am so afraid:&mdash;but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely&mdash; and therewas a mat to step upon&mdash;I shall never forget his extremepoliteness.&mdash;Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother'sspectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came outagain. My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she,Jane?&mdash;Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?&mdash; Ah! here's MissWoodhouse.&mdash;Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?&mdash; Very well I thankyou, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!&mdash; Such atransformation!&mdash;Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma mostcomplacently)&mdash;that would be rude&mdash;but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,you do look&mdash;how do you like Jane's hair?&mdash;You are a judge.&mdash; She didit all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her hair!&mdash; No hairdresserfrom London I think could.&mdash;Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare&mdash; and Mrs. Hughes.Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.&mdash;How do you do?How do you do?&mdash;Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is notit?&mdash;Where's dear Mr. Richard?&mdash; Oh! there he is. Don't disturb him.Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do you do, Mr.Richard?&mdash;I saw you the other day as you rode through the town&mdash;Mrs.Otway, I protest!&mdash; and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and MissCaroline.&mdash;Such a host of friends!&mdash;and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!&mdash;Howdo you do? How do you all do?&mdash;Quite well, I am much obliged to you.Never better.&mdash; Don't I hear another carriage?&mdash;Who can this be?&mdash;verylikely the worthy Coles.&mdash;Upon my word, this is charming to be standingabout among such friends! And such a noble fire!&mdash;I am quite roasted.No coffee, I thank you, for me&mdash;never take coffee.&mdash;A little tea if youplease, sir, by and bye,&mdash;no hurry&mdash;Oh! here it comes. Every thing sogood!"</p> <p>Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as MissBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing thediscourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a littleway behind her.&mdash;He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too,she could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on herdress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Eltonwas evidently wanting to be complimented herself&mdash; and it was, "How doyou like my gown?&mdash;How do you like my trimming?&mdash; How has Wright donemy hair?"&mdash;with many other relative questions, all answered withpatient politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, "Nobody can think less ofdress in general than I do&mdash;but upon such an occasion as this, whenevery body's eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to theWestons&mdash;who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do mehonour&mdash;I would not wish to be inferior to others. And I see very fewpearls in the room except mine.&mdash; So Frank Churchill is a capitaldancer, I understand.&mdash;We shall see if our styles suit.&mdash;A fine youngman certainly is Frank Churchill. I like him very well."</p> <p>At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma couldnot but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want tohear more;&mdash;and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, tillanother suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctlyforward.&mdash;Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,</p> <p>"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?&mdash; Iwas this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatientfor tidings of us."</p> <p>"Jane!"&mdash;repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize anddispleasure.&mdash; "That is easy&mdash;but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it,I suppose."</p> <p>"How do you like Mrs. Elton?" said Emma in a whisper.</p> <p>"Not at all."</p> <p>"You are ungrateful."</p> <p>"Ungrateful!&mdash;What do you mean?" Then changing from a frown to asmile&mdash;"No, do not tell me&mdash;I do not want to know what you mean.&mdash;Where is my father?&mdash;When are we to begin dancing?"</p> <p>Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. Hewalked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr.and Mrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, whichmust be laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs.Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; whichinterfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.&mdash;Emmaheard the sad truth with fortitude.</p> <p>"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?" said Mr. Weston. "She will think Frank ought to ask her."</p> <p>Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; andboasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his mostperfect approbation of&mdash;and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston waswanting <i>him</i> to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that theirbusiness was to help to persuade him into it, which was done prettysoon.&mdash; Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill andMiss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs.Elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton hadundoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completelygratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill,she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be his son'ssuperior.&mdash; In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling withenjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it wasforming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivitybefore her.&mdash; She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancingthan by any thing else.&mdash;There he was, among the standers-by, where heought not to be; he ought to be dancing,&mdash;not classing himself with thehusbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feelan interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,&mdash;so young ashe looked!&mdash; He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhapsanywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall, firm, uprightfigure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderlymen, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, exceptingher own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men whocould be compared with him.&mdash;He moved a few steps nearer, and those fewsteps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with whatnatural grace, he must have danced, would he but take thetrouble.&mdash;Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but ingeneral he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroombetter, and could like Frank Churchill better.&mdash; He seemed oftenobserving her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of herdancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feelafraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That FrankChurchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.</p> <p>The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessantattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemedhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldombestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given inthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, veryrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetingsusually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought somethingof.&mdash;The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had nopartner;&mdash;the only young lady sitting down;&mdash; and so equal had beenhitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any onedisengaged was the wonder!&mdash;But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards,on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to danceif it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not&mdash;and shewas expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.</p> <p>Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the roomwhere the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about infront of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution ofmaintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before MissSmith, or speaking to those who were close to her.&mdash; Emma saw it. Shewas not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, andhad therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head alittle she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the wholegroup were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyesto watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of adialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; andshe perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her,was not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significantglances.&mdash;The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat tojoin him and say, "Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?" to which his promptreply was, "Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."</p> <p>"Me!&mdash;oh! no&mdash;I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no dancer."</p> <p>"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance," said he, "I shall have greatpleasure, I am sure&mdash;for, though beginning to feel myself rather an oldmarried man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me verygreat pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.Gilbert."</p> <p>"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young ladydisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing&mdash;Miss Smith.""Miss Smith!&mdash;oh!&mdash;I had not observed.&mdash;You are extremely obliging&mdash;and if I were not an old married man.&mdash;But my dancing days are over,Mrs. Weston. You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happyto do, at your command&mdash;but my dancing days are over."</p> <p>Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprizeand mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr.Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.&mdash; She looked round fora moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and wasarranging himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high gleepassed between him and his wife.</p> <p>She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her face might be as hot.</p> <p>In another moment a happier sight caught her;&mdash;Mr. Knightley leadingHarriet to the set!&mdash;Never had she been more surprized, seldom moredelighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and thoughtoo distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she couldcatch his eye again.</p> <p>His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremelygood; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had notbeen for the cruel state of things before, and for the very completeenjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happyfeatures announced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higherthan ever, flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual courseof smiles.</p> <p>Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted)very foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife,though growing very like her;&mdash;<i>she</i> spoke some of her feelings, by observing audibly to her partner,</p> <p>"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!&mdash;Very goodnatured, I declare."</p> <p>Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heardfrom that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at tableand taking up her spoon.</p> <p>"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?&mdash;Here is your tippet. Mrs.Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid therewill be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done&mdash;Onedoor nailed up&mdash;Quantities of matting&mdash;My dear Jane, indeed you must.Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!&mdash;sogratified! Excellent dancing indeed!&mdash; Yes, my dear, I ran home, as Isaid I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobodymissed me.&mdash;I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, avast deal of chat, and backgammon.&mdash;Tea was made downstairs, biscuitsand baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some ofher throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you wereamused, and who were your partners. `Oh!' said I, `I shall notforestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will loveto tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr.Elton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.'My dear sir, you are too obliging.&mdash;Is there nobody you would notrather?&mdash;I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Janeon one arm, and me on the other!&mdash;Stop, stop, let us stand a littleback, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant shelooks!&mdash;Beautiful lace!&mdash;Now we all follow in her train. Quite thequeen of the evening!&mdash;Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps,Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I waspersuaded there were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two,and there is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort andstyle&mdash;Candles everywhere.&mdash;I was telling you of your grandmama,Jane,&mdash;There was a little disappointment.&mdash; The baked apples andbiscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicatefricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, andgood Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough,sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better thansweetbread and asparagus&mdash; so she was rather disappointed, but weagreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its gettinground to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very muchconcerned!&mdash;Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not havesupposed any thing!&mdash;Such elegance and profusion!&mdash;I have seen nothinglike it since&mdash; Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere,so that Jane is not in a draught. Where <i>I</i> sit is of noconsequence. Oh! do you recommend this side?&mdash;Well, I am sure, Mr.Churchill&mdash; only it seems too good&mdash;but just as you please. What youdirect in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we everrecollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I shouldnot be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot helpbeginning."</p> <p>Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till aftersupper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invitedhim irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in hisreprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.</p> <p>"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet," said he. "Emma, why is it that they are your enemies?"</p> <p>He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added, "<i>She</i>ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may be.&mdash;To thatsurmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you didwant him to marry Harriet."</p> <p>"I did," replied Emma, "and they cannot forgive me."</p> <p>He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he only said,</p> <p>"I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections."</p> <p>"Can you trust me with such flatterers?&mdash;Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong?"</p> <p>"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.&mdash;If one leads you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."</p> <p>"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I didnot: and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. Itwas through a series of strange blunders!"</p> <p>"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you thejustice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he haschosen for himself.&mdash;Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, whichMrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artlessgirl&mdash; infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to sucha woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than Iexpected."</p> <p>Emma was extremely gratified.&mdash;They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.</p> <p>"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you alldoing?&mdash; Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body islazy! Every body is asleep!"</p> <p>"I am ready," said Emma, "whenever I am wanted."</p> <p>"Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley.</p> <p>She hesitated a moment, and then replied, "With you, if you will ask me."</p> <p>"Will you?" said he, offering his hand.</p> <p>"Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know weare not really so much brother and sister as to make it at allimproper."</p> <p>"Brother and sister! no, indeed."</p></body>
