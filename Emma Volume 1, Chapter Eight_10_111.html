<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Eight</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she hadbeen spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting tohave a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best inevery respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much aspossible just at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for anhour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that sheshould return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.</p><p>While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up hismind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, andwas induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples ofhis own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr.Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by hisshort, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologiesand civil hesitations of the other.</p><p>"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you willnot consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's adviceand go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I hadbetter take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people."</p><p>"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."</p><p>"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happyto entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and takemy three turns&mdash;my winter walk."</p><p>"You cannot do better, sir."</p><p>"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but Iam a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and,besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey."</p><p>"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the sooner <i>you</i> go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you."</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of beingimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for morechat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with morevoluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.</p><p>"I cannot rate her beauty as you do," said he; "but she is a prettylittle creature, and I am inclined to think very well of herdisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in goodhands she will turn out a valuable woman."</p><p>"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting."</p><p>"Come," said he, "you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tellyou that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl'sgiggle; she really does you credit."</p><p>"Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I hadbeen of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise wherethey may. <i>You</i> do not often overpower me with it."</p><p>"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?"</p><p>"Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she intended."</p><p>"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps."</p><p>"Highbury gossips!&mdash;Tiresome wretches!"</p><p>"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would."</p><p>Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing. He presently added, with a smile,</p><p>"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell youthat I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear ofsomething to her advantage."</p><p>"Indeed! how so? of what sort?"</p><p>"A very serious sort, I assure you;" still smiling.</p><p>"Very serious! I can think of but one thing&mdash;Who is in love with her? Who makes you their confidant?"</p><p>Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knewMr. Elton looked up to him.</p><p>"I have reason to think," he replied, "that Harriet Smith will soonhave an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionablequarter:&mdash;Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, thissummer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love andmeans to marry her."</p><p>"He is very obliging," said Emma; "but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him?"</p><p>"Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He cameto the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. Heknows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, Ibelieve, considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask mewhether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved hischoice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her beingconsidered (especially since <i>your</i> making so much of her) as ina line of society above him. I was very much pleased with all that hesaid. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin. Healways speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very welljudging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and whatthey all proposed doing in the event of his marriage. He is anexcellent young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation inadvising him to marry. He proved to me that he could afford it; andthat being the case, I was convinced he could not do better. I praisedthe fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy. If he hadnever esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of methen; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend andcounsellor man ever had. This happened the night before last. Now, aswe may fairly suppose, he would not allow much time to pass before hespoke to the lady, and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday,it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and shemay be detained by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresomewretch."</p><p>"Pray, Mr. Knightley," said Emma, who had been smiling to herselfthrough a great part of this speech, "how do you know that Mr. Martindid not speak yesterday?"</p><p>"Certainly," replied he, surprized, "I do not absolutely know it; but it may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?"</p><p>"Come," said she, "I will tell you something, in return for what youhave told me. He did speak yesterday&mdash;that is, he wrote, and wasrefused."</p><p>This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as hestood up, in tall indignation, and said,</p><p>"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the foolish girl about?"</p><p>"Oh! to be sure," cried Emma, "it is always incomprehensible to aman that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man alwaysimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her."</p><p>"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is themeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it isso; but I hope you are mistaken."</p><p>"I saw her answer!&mdash;nothing could be clearer."</p><p>"You saw her answer!&mdash;you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your doing. You persuaded her to refuse him."</p><p>"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should notfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprizedindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, hedoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were evergot over."</p><p>"Not Harriet's equal!" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, "No, he isnot her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as insituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What areHarriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to anyconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter ofnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, andcertainly no respectable relations. She is known only asparlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor agirl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is tooyoung and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age shecan have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likelyever to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is goodtempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was onhis account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not doworse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing totrust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort ofdisposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led arightand turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all onher side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that therewould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even <i>your</i>satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that youwould not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of herbeing settled so well. I remember saying to myself, `Even Emma, withall her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'"</p><p>"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to sayany such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and allhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimatefriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a manwhom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder youshould think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure youmine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.You are not just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated verydifferently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richestof the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank insociety.&mdash;The sphere in which she moves is much above his.&mdash;It would bea degradation."</p><p>"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!"</p><p>"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense shemay be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not topay for the offence of others, by being held below the level of thosewith whom she is brought up.&mdash;There can scarcely be a doubt that herfather is a gentleman&mdash;and a gentleman of fortune.&mdash;Her allowance isvery liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement orcomfort.&mdash;That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me;that she associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend,will deny.&mdash;She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin."</p><p>"Whoever might be her parents," said Mr. Knightley, "whoever mayhave had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part oftheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs.Goddard's hands to shift as she can;&mdash;to move, in short, in Mrs.Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her friendsevidently thought this good enough for her; and it <i>was</i> goodenough. She desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn herinto a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor anyambition beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins inthe summer. She had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now,you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma.Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he had not feltpersuaded of her not being disinclined to him. I know him well. He hastoo much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfishpassion. And as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man Iknow. Depend upon it he had encouragement."</p><p>It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to thisassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subjectagain.</p><p>"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not socontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but shehas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to haveher understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point,however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty andgood-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for sheis, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-ninepeople out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much morephilosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsomefaces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty ofbeing admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing fromamong many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, isnot so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thoroughsweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and agreat readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very muchmistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and suchtemper, the highest claims a woman could possess."</p><p>"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, isalmost enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, thanmisapply it as you do."</p><p>"To be sure!" cried she playfully. "I know <i>that</i> is thefeeling of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly whatevery man delights in&mdash;what at once bewitches his senses and satisfieshis judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, everto marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, justentering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered atbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No&mdash;pray lether have time to look about her."</p><p>"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy," said Mr.Knightley presently, "though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but Inow perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. Youwill puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she hasa claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will begood enough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sortof mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise herexpectations too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers ofmarriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men ofsense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men offamily would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl ofsuch obscurity&mdash;and most prudent men would be afraid of theinconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mysteryof her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, andshe is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage herto expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothingless than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be aparlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest of her life&mdash;or, atleast, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,)till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the oldwriting-master's son."</p><p>"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, thatthere can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making eachother more angry. But as to my <i>letting</i> her marry Robert Martin,it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, asmust prevent any second application. She must abide by the evil ofhaving refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, Iwill not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but Iassure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. Hisappearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if sheever were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, thatbefore she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He wasthe brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; andaltogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his greatassistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find himdisagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what gentlemenare; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chancewith Harriet."</p><p>"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!" cried Mr.Knightley.&mdash;"Robert Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, andgood-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentilitythan Harriet Smith could understand."</p><p>Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, butwas really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself abetter judge of such a point of female right and refinement than hecould be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgmentin general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; andto have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was verydisagreeable. Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with onlyone attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made noanswer. He was thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last inthese words.</p><p>"Robert Martin has no great loss&mdash;if he can but think so; and I hopeit will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are bestknown to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love ofmatch-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projectsyou have;&mdash;and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton isthe man, I think it will be all labour in vain."</p><p>Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,</p><p>"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort ofman, and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely tomake an imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well asany body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. Heis as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be withHarriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a greatfavourite wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking inunreserved moments, when there are only men present, I am convincedthat he does not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speakwith great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sistersare intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece."</p><p>"I am very much obliged to you," said Emma, laughing again. "If Ihad set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have beenvery kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harrietto myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope toequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well."</p><p>"Good morning to you,"&mdash;said he, rising and walking off abruptly. Hewas very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, andwas mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanctionhe had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in theaffair, was provoking him exceedingly.</p><p>Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was moreindistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not alwaysfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced thather opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. Hewalked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. Shewas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time andthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet'sstaying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibilityof the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meetingwith Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dreadof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and whenHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any suchreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction whichsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.Knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing whichwoman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.</p><p>He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when sheconsidered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she haddone, neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tellherself, in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill ofsuch an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken ithastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather saidwhat he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew any thingabout. He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with moreunreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not be of animprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he mightnaturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them; but then, Mr.Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strongpassion at war with all interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no suchpassion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw toomuch of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that areasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than areasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did notbelong to Mr. Elton.</p><p>Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash hadbeen telling her something, which she repeated immediately with greatdelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he wascoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, andfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road toLondon, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was thewhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.Perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby itwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very muchto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would notdo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a <i>very</i> <i>particular</i>way indeed, that he was going on business which he would not put offfor any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviablecommission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious. Mr.Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there mustbe a <i>lady</i> in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton onlylooked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits. MissNash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more about Mr.Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her, "that she didnot pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only knewthat any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should think theluckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not hisequal for beauty or agreeableness."</p></body>
