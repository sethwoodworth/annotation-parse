<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Three</H2><p>Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very muchto have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from hisfortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits ofhis own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not muchintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of latehours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintancebut such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him,Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey inthe parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended manysuch. Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of thechosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what hepreferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal tocompany, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma couldnot make up a card-table for him.</p><p>Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, theprivilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitudefor the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and thesmiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.</p><p>After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whomwere Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost alwaysat the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetchedand carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardshipfor either James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, itwould have been a grievance.</p><p>Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very oldlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with hersingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all theregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untowardcircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degreeof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for havingmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority tomake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her intooutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Heryouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life wasdevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make asmall income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, anda woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universalgood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She lovedevery body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted toevery body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, andsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many goodneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. Thesimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and gratefulspirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity toherself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactlysuited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmlessgossip.</p><p>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School&mdash;not of a seminary, or anestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences ofrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegantmorality, upon new principles and new systems&mdash;and where young ladiesfor enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity&mdash;but areal, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonablequantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and wheregirls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves intoa little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.Goddard's school was in high repute&mdash;and very deservedly; for Highburywas reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house andgarden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run abouta great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains withher own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple nowwalked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled tothe occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much toMr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave herneat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and winor lose a few sixpences by his fireside.</p><p>These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently ableto collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power;though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for theabsence of Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father lookcomfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving thingsso well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel thatevery evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she hadfearfully anticipated.</p><p>As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close ofthe present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, inmost respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; amost welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emmaknew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on accountof her beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the eveningno longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.</p><p>Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody hadplaced her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebodyhad lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that ofparlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, andwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some youngladies who had been at school there with her.</p><p>She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sortwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with afine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look ofgreat sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as muchpleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined tocontinue the acquaintance.</p><p>She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith'sconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging&mdash;notinconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk&mdash;and yet so far from pushing,shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantlygrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed bythe appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she hadbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all thosenatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society ofHighbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formedwere unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, thoughvery good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family ofthe name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting alarge farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish ofDonwell&mdash;very creditably, she believed&mdash;she knew Mr. Knightley thoughthighly of them&mdash;but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfitto be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledgeand elegance to be quite perfect. <i>She</i> would notice her; shewould improve her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, andintroduce her into good society; she would form her opinions and hermanners. It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kindundertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure,and powers.</p><p>She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking andlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that theevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, whichalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit andwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards tothe fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the commonimpulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit ofdoing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of amind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours ofthe meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scallopedoysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to theearly hours and civil scruples of their guests.</p><p>Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sadwarfare. He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been thefashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being veryunwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and whilehis hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, hiscare for their health made him grieve that they would eat.</p><p>Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that hecould, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he mightconstrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicerthings, to say:</p><p>"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. Anegg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling anegg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by anybody else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, yousee&mdash;one of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma helpyou to a <i>little</i> bit of tart&mdash;a <i>very</i> little bit. Ours areall apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here.I do not advise the custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to <i>half</i> a glass of wine? A <i>small</i> half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with you."</p><p>Emma allowed her father to talk&mdash;but supplied her visitors in a muchmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particularpleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith wasquite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personagein Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as muchpanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off withhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with whichMiss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shakenhands with her at last!</p></body>
