<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Eight</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's dinnerwaiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxiousfor his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray anyimperfection which could be concealed.</p><p>He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with avery good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what hehad done. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal anyconfusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve hisspirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, afterseeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:&mdash;</p><p>"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly thingsdo cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudentway. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not alwaysfolly.&mdash;It depends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr.Knightley, he is <i>not</i> a trifling, silly young man. If he were,he would have done this differently. He would either have gloried inthe achievement, or been ashamed of it. There would have been eitherthe ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak todefend its own vanities.&mdash;No, I am perfectly sure that he is nottrifling or silly."</p><p>With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, andfor a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, andby inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; ofguessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness intoher air; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be,who were now seeing them together for the first time.</p><p>She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more thanhis propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.</p><p>Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she leftthe house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together afterdinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of herdress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helpingthem to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whateverunwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obligedthem to practise during the meal.&mdash;She had provided a plentiful dinnerfor them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eatit.</p><p>She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased tosee that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, andindependence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he could,and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm fromher heart, for he stopped to hand her out.</p><p>"This is coming as you should do," said she; "like a gentleman.&mdash; I am quite glad to see you."</p><p>He thanked her, observing, "How lucky that we should arrive at thesame moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubtwhether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman thanusual.&mdash; You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look ormanner."</p><p>"Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look ofconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to bebeneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, butwith you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; Ialways observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. <i>Now</i>you have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposedashamed. You are not striving to look taller than any body else. <i>Now</i> I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you."</p><p>"Nonsensical girl!" was his reply, but not at all in anger.</p><p>Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the partyas with Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect whichcould not but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for.When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest ofadmiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approachedher with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,and at dinner she found him seated by her&mdash;and, as she firmly believed,not without some dexterity on his side.</p><p>The party was rather large, as it included one other family, aproper unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantageof naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox'sfamily, the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come inthe evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; butalready, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject ofconversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton weretalked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to thepleasantness of her neighbour. The first remote sound to which she feltherself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Coleseemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be veryinteresting. She listened, and found it well worth listening to. Thatvery dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs.Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soonas she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte&mdash;avery elegant looking instrument&mdash;not a grand, but a large-sized squarepianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end of all the dialoguewhich ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side,and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrivedfrom Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both auntand niece&mdash;entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account,Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who couldpossibly have ordered it&mdash; but now, they were both perfectly satisfiedthat it could be from only one quarter;&mdash;of course it must be fromColonel Campbell.</p><p>"One can suppose nothing else," added Mrs. Cole, "and I was onlysurprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence asany reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuseto surprize her."</p><p>Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on thesubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there wereenough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and stilllisten to Mrs. Cole.</p><p>"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has givenme more satisfaction!&mdash;It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax,who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemedquite a shame, especially considering how many houses there are wherefine instruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like givingourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was tellingMr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte inthe drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and ourlittle girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make anything of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music,has not any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even thepitifullest old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.&mdash;I wassaying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me;only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not helpindulging himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our goodneighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better usethan we can; and that really is the reason why the instrument wasbought&mdash; or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.&mdash;We are ingreat hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it thisevening."</p><p>Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding thatnothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's,turned to Frank Churchill.</p><p>"Why do you smile?" said she.</p><p>"Nay, why do you?"</p><p>"Me!&mdash;I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich and so liberal.&mdash;It is a handsome present."</p><p>"Very."</p><p>"I rather wonder that it was never made before."</p><p>"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before."</p><p>"Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument&mdash; which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body."</p><p>"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates's house."</p><p>"You may <i>say</i> what you chuse&mdash;but your countenance testifies that your <i>thoughts</i> on this subject are very much like mine."</p><p>"I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit foracuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probablysuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see whatthere is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who canbe?"</p><p>"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?"</p><p>"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. Shemust know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be;and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like ayoung woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I daresay. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine."</p><p>"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend <i>Mr</i>. Dixon in them."</p><p>"Mr. Dixon.&mdash;Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must bethe joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the otherday, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance."</p><p>"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which Ihad entertained before.&mdash;I do not mean to reflect upon the goodintentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot helpsuspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend, hehad the misfortune to fall in love with <i>her</i>, or that he becameconscious of a little attachment on her side. One might guess twentythings without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must bea particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of goingwith the Campbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life ofprivation and penance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As tothe pretence of trying her native air, I look upon that as a mereexcuse.&mdash;In the summer it might have passed; but what can any body'snative air do for them in the months of January, February, and March?Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in mostcases of delicate health, and I dare say in her's. I do not require youto adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble a profession ofdoing it, but I honestly tell you what they are."</p><p>"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr.Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for beingvery decided."</p><p>"And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?&mdash; A waterparty; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her."</p><p>"He did. I was there&mdash;one of the party."</p><p>"Were you really?&mdash;Well!&mdash;But you observed nothing of course, for itseems to be a new idea to you.&mdash;If I had been there, I think I shouldhave made some discoveries."</p><p>"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact,that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixoncaught her.&mdash;It was the work of a moment. And though the consequentshock and alarm was very great and much more durable&mdash;indeed I believeit was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again&mdash; yet thatwas too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to beobservable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have madediscoveries."</p><p>The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to sharein the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, andobliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when thetable was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placedexactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emmasaid,</p><p>"The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted toknow a little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, weshall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon."</p><p>"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells."</p><p>"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows itis not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first.She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may nothave convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself thatMr. Dixon is a principal in the business."</p><p>"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasoningscarry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposedyou satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only aspaternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable thatit should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can seeit in no other light than as an offering of love."</p><p>There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The convictionseemed real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, othersubjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; thedessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admiredamid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a fewdownright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one northe other&mdash;nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, oldnews, and heavy jokes.</p><p>The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the otherladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entreeof her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in herdignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness andthe artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so manyalleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointedaffection. There she sat&mdash;and who would have guessed how many tears shehad been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself andseeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and saynothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfaxdid look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been gladto change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased themortification of having loved&mdash;yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton invain&mdash;by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herselfbeloved by the husband of her friend.</p><p>In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approachher. She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much inthe secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interestfair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others,the subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush ofconsciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush ofguilt which accompanied the name of "my excellent friend ColonelCampbell."</p><p>Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interestedby the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at herperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask andto say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wishof saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in thefair heroine's countenance.</p><p>They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very firstof the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and thehandsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Batesand her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of thecircle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,would not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must bethinking. She was his object, and every body must perceive it. Sheintroduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient momentsafterwards, heard what each thought of the other. "He had never seen solovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete." And she, "Only tobe sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did thinkthere were some looks a little like Mr. Elton." Emma restrained herindignation, and only turned from her in silence.</p><p>Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on firstglancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room&mdash; hatedsitting long&mdash;was always the first to move when he could&mdash; that hisfather, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy overparish business&mdash;that as long as he had staid, however, it had beenpleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set ofgentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highburyaltogether&mdash;thought it so abundant in agreeable families&mdash; that Emmabegan to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much.She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire&mdash; the extent of theneighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from hisanswers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very littlegoing on, that their visitings were among a range of great families,none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitationsaccepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in healthand spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no freshperson; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was notwithout difficulty, without considerable address <i>at</i> <i>times</i>, that he could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.</p><p>She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken atits best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirementat home than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. Hedid not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuadedhis aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing andnoticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) hecould <i>with</i> <i>time</i> persuade her to any thing. One of thosepoints on which his influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wantedvery much to go abroad&mdash;had been very eager indeed to be allowed totravel&mdash;but she would not hear of it. This had happened the yearbefore. <i>Now</i>, he said, he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.</p><p>The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father.</p><p>"I have made a most wretched discovery," said he, after a shortpause.&mdash; "I have been here a week to-morrow&mdash;half my time. I never knewdays fly so fast. A week to-morrow!&mdash;And I have hardly begun to enjoymyself. But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!&mdash; I hatethe recollection."</p><p>"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out of so few, in having your hair cut."</p><p>"No," said he, smiling, "that is no subject of regret at all. I haveno pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to beseen."</p><p>The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herselfobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored asbefore, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room atMiss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.</p><p>"What is the matter?" said she.</p><p>He started. "Thank you for rousing me," he replied. "I believe Ihave been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in soodd a way&mdash;so very odd a way&mdash;that I cannot keep my eyes from her. Inever saw any thing so outree!&mdash;Those curls!&mdash;This must be a fancy ofher own. I see nobody else looking like her!&mdash; I must go and ask herwhether it is an Irish fashion. Shall I?&mdash; Yes, I will&mdash;I declare Iwill&mdash;and you shall see how she takes it;&mdash; whether she colours."</p><p>He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before MissFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, ashe had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly infront of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.</p><p>Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.</p><p>"This is the luxury of a large party," said she:&mdash;"one can get nearevery body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk toyou. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just likeyourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know howMiss Bates and her niece came here?"</p><p>"How?&mdash;They were invited, were not they?"</p><p>"Oh! yes&mdash;but how they were conveyed hither?&mdash;the manner of their coming?"</p><p>"They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?"</p><p>"Very true.&mdash;Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sadit would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, andcold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never sawher appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, andwould therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I couldnot bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You mayguess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, Imade my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriagewould be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it wouldbe making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful aspossible, you may be sure. `Nobody was ever so fortunate asherself!'&mdash;but with many, many thanks&mdash;`there was no occasion totrouble us, for Mr. Knightley's carriage had brought, and was to takethem home again.' I was quite surprized;&mdash;very glad, I am sure; butreally quite surprized. Such a very kind attention&mdash;and so thoughtfulan attention!&mdash; the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And,in short, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to thinkthat it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I dosuspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that itwas only as an excuse for assisting them."</p><p>"Very likely," said Emma&mdash;"nothing more likely. I know no man morelikely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing&mdash;to do any thingreally good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not agallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering JaneFairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;&mdash;and foran act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix onmore than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day&mdash;for we arrivedtogether; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word thatcould betray."</p><p>"Well," said Mrs. Weston, smiling, "you give him credit for moresimple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for whileMiss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I havenever been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the moreprobable it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr.Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping youcompany!&mdash;What do you say to it?"</p><p>"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!" exclaimed Emma. "Dear Mrs. Weston,how could you think of such a thing?&mdash;Mr. Knightley!&mdash;Mr. Knightleymust not marry!&mdash;You would not have little Henry cut out fromDonwell?&mdash; Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consentto Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. Iam amazed that you should think of such a thing."</p><p>"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do notwant the match&mdash;I do not want to injure dear little Henry&mdash; but theidea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley reallywished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's account, aboy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?"</p><p>"Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.&mdash; Mr.Knightley marry!&mdash;No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adoptit now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!"</p><p>"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well know."</p><p>"But the imprudence of such a match!"</p><p>"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability."</p><p>"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundationthan what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you,would be quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regardfor the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax&mdash; and is alwaysglad to shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take tomatch-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of theAbbey!&mdash;Oh! no, no;&mdash;every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I wouldnot have him do so mad a thing."</p><p>"Imprudent, if you please&mdash;but not mad. Excepting inequality offortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothingunsuitable."</p><p>"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not theleast idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?&mdash;He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep,and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fondof his brother's children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fillup his time or his heart."</p><p>"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax&mdash;"</p><p>"Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love,I am sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family;but&mdash;"</p><p>"Well," said Mrs. Weston, laughing, "perhaps the greatest good he could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home."</p><p>"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself;a very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have MissBates belonging to him?&mdash;To have her haunting the Abbey, and thankinghim all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?&mdash; `So verykind and obliging!&mdash;But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's oldpetticoat. `Not that it was such a very old petticoat either&mdash;for stillit would last a great while&mdash;and, indeed, she must thankfully say thattheir petticoats were all very strong.'"</p><p>"For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against myconscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would bemuch disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. Shemight talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would onlytalk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is not, whether itwould be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I thinkhe does. I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly ofJane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her&mdash; his anxiety about herhealth&mdash;his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I haveheard him express himself so warmly on those points!&mdash;Such an admirerof her performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heardhim say that he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almostforgotten one idea that occurred to me&mdash;this pianoforte that has beensent here by somebody&mdash; though we have all been so well satisfied toconsider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr.Knightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the personto do it, even without being in love."</p><p>"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I donot think it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley doesnothing mysteriously."</p><p>"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the commoncourse of things, occur to him."</p><p>"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told her so."</p><p>"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a verystrong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularlysilent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner."</p><p>"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you havemany a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment&mdash; Ibelieve nothing of the pianoforte&mdash;and proof only shall convince methat Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax."</p><p>They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emmarather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston wasthe most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the roomshewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;&mdash; andat the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse woulddo them the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in theeagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeingnothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr.Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, itsuited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance.</p><p>She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt morethan she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spiritin the little things which are generally acceptable, and couldaccompany her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took heragreeably by surprize&mdash;a second, slightly but correctly taken by FrankChurchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, andevery thing usual followed. He was accused of having a delightfulvoice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; andthat he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundlyasserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign herplace to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental,she never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitelysuperior to her own.</p><p>With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance fromthe numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sangagain. They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth.But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew awayhalf Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subjectof Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the unitedvoices gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr.Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside. She could seenothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. JohnKnightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children&mdash;amost mortifying change, and material loss to them all;&mdash;a very greatdeduction from her father's daily comfort&mdash;and, as to herself, shecould not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. AMrs. Knightley for them all to give way to!&mdash;No&mdash;Mr. Knightley mustnever marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.</p><p>Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her.They talked at first only of the performance. His admiration wascertainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would nothave struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speakof his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answerwas in the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it toindicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.</p><p>"I often feel concern," said she, "that I dare not make our carriagemore useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish;but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James shouldput-to for such a purpose."</p><p>"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question," hereplied;&mdash; "but you must often wish it, I am sure." And he smiled withsuch seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed anotherstep.</p><p>"This present from the Campbells," said she&mdash;"this pianoforte is very kindly given."</p><p>"Yes," he replied, and without the smallest apparentembarrassment.&mdash; "But they would have done better had they given hernotice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is notenhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should haveexpected better judgment in Colonel Campbell."</p><p>From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightleyhad had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he wereentirely free from peculiar attachment&mdash;whether there were no actualpreference&mdash;remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end ofJane's second song, her voice grew thick.</p><p>"That will do," said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud&mdash; "you have sung quite enough for one evening&mdash;now be quiet."</p><p>Another song, however, was soon begged for. "One more;&mdash;they wouldnot fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for onemore." And Frank Churchill was heard to say, "I think you could managethis without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strengthof the song falls on the second."</p><p>Mr. Knightley grew angry.</p><p>"That fellow," said he, indignantly, "thinks of nothing but shewingoff his own voice. This must not be." And touching Miss Bates, who atthat moment passed near&mdash;"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niecesing herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have nomercy on her."</p><p>Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even tobe grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farthersinging. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for MissWoodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; butsoon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing&mdash; originating nobodyexactly knew where&mdash;was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole,that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs.Weston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning anirresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becominggallantry to Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.</p><p>While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on hervoice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If hewere to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augursomething. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking toMrs. Cole&mdash; he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebodyelse, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.</p><p>Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe;and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not morethan five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddennessof it made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in apartner. They were a couple worth looking at.</p><p>Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It wasgrowing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on hermother's account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted tobegin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful,and have done.</p><p>"Perhaps it is as well," said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emmato her carriage. "I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languiddancing would not have agreed with me, after your's."</p></body>
