<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Fifteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She was obliged,in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it allthe justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her ownname, it was irresistible; every line relating to herself wasinteresting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this charmceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the natural returnof her former regard for the writer, and the very strong attractionwhich any picture of love must have for her at that moment. She neverstopt till she had gone through the whole; and though it was impossiblenot to feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than shehad supposed&mdash;and he had suffered, and was very sorry&mdash;and he was sograteful to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and shewas so happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he haveentered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily asever.</p><p>She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley cameagain, she desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston'swishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr.Knightley, had seen so much to blame in his conduct.</p><p>"I shall be very glad to look it over," said he; "but it seems long. I will take it home with me at night."</p><p>But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she must return it by him.</p><p>"I would rather be talking to you," he replied; "but as it seems a matter of justice, it shall be done."</p><p>He began&mdash;stopping, however, almost directly to say, "Had I beenoffered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to hismother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken withsuch indifference."</p><p>He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with asmile, observed, "Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is hisway. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not besevere."</p><p>"It will be natural for me," he added shortly afterwards, "to speakmy opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am nearyou. It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it&mdash;"</p><p>"Not at all. I should wish it."</p><p>Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.</p><p>"He trifles here," said he, "as to the temptation. He knows he iswrong, and has nothing rational to urge.&mdash;Bad.&mdash;He ought not to haveformed the engagement.&mdash;`His father's disposition:'&mdash; he is unjust,however, to his father. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing onall his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned everypresent comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.&mdash;Very true; he didnot come till Miss Fairfax was here."</p><p>"And I have not forgotten," said Emma, "how sure you were that hemight have come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely&mdash;but you were perfectly right."</p><p>"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:&mdash;but yet, I think&mdash; had <i>you</i> not been in the case&mdash;I should still have distrusted him."</p><p>When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole ofit aloud&mdash;all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of thehead; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, asthe subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steadyreflection, thus&mdash;</p><p>"Very bad&mdash;though it might have been worse.&mdash;Playing a mostdangerous game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.&mdash; Nojudge of his own manners by you.&mdash;Always deceived in fact by his ownwishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.&mdash;Fancying you to have fathomed his secret. Natural enough!&mdash; his ownmind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it in others.&mdash;Mystery;Finesse&mdash;how they pervert the understanding! My Emma, does not everything serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity inall our dealings with each other?"</p><p>Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account, which she could not give any sincere explanation of.</p><p>"You had better go on," said she.</p><p>He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, "the pianoforte! Ah!That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to considerwhether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed thepleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!&mdash;I cannot comprehend a man's wishingto give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would ratherdispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented theinstrument's coming if she could."</p><p>After this, he made some progress without any pause. FrankChurchill's confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thingto call for more than a word in passing.</p><p>"I perfectly agree with you, sir,"&mdash;was then his remark. "You didbehave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line." And having gonethrough what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement,and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's senseof right, he made a fuller pause to say, "This is very bad.&mdash;He hadinduced her to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extremedifficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object toprevent her from suffering unnecessarily.&mdash;She must have had much moreto contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. Heshould have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such;but hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, andremember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to theengagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state ofpunishment."</p><p>Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grewuncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She wasdeeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fearof giving pain&mdash;no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.</p><p>"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, theEltons," was his next observation.&mdash;"His feelings are natural.&mdash; What!actually resolve to break with him entirely!&mdash;She felt the engagementto be a source of repentance and misery to each&mdash; she dissolvedit.&mdash;What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!&mdash;Well, hemust be a most extraordinary&mdash;"</p><p>"Nay, nay, read on.&mdash;You will find how very much he suffers."</p><p>"I hope he does," replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter. "`Smallridge!'&mdash;What does this mean? What is all this?"</p><p>"She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children&mdash;a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's&mdash;a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by thebye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?"</p><p>"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read&mdash;not even ofMrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letterthe man writes!"</p><p>"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him."</p><p>"Well, there <i>is</i> feeling here.&mdash;He does seem to have sufferedin finding her ill.&mdash;Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fondof her. `Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope he may long continue tofeel all the value of such a reconciliation.&mdash;He is a very liberalthanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.&mdash;`Happier than Ideserve.' Come, he knows himself there. `Miss Woodhouse calls me thechild of good fortune.'&mdash;Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, werethey?&mdash; And a fine ending&mdash;and there is the letter. The child of goodfortune! That was your name for him, was it?"</p><p>"You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; butstill you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him forit. I hope it does him some service with you."</p><p>"Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults ofinconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinionin thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as heis, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, itmay be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I amvery ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hersthe steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let metalk to you of something else. I have another person's interest atpresent so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about FrankChurchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has beenhard at work on one subject."</p><p>The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlikeEnglish, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in lovewith, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking thehappiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word."While her dear father lived, any change of condition must beimpossible for her. She could never quit him." Part only of thisanswer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting herfather, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but theinadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to. He had beenthinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped toinduce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted tobelieve it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would notsuffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed hispersuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father'scomfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr.Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!&mdash;No, he felt that it ought not to beattempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, hetrusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as herfather's happiness in other words his life&mdash;required Hartfield tocontinue her home, it should be his likewise.</p><p>Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her ownpassing thoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it;but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her. She wassensible of all the affection it evinced. She felt that, in quittingDonwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hoursand habits; that in living constantly with her father, and in no houseof his own, there would be much, very much, to be borne with. Shepromised to think of it, and advised him to think of it more; but hewas fully convinced, that no reflection could alter his wishes or hisopinion on the subject. He had given it, he could assure her, very longand calm consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkinsthe whole morning, to have his thoughts to himself.</p><p>"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for," cried Emma. "I am sureWilliam Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before youask mine."</p><p>She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very goodscheme.</p><p>It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of viewin which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was neverstruck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights asheir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think shemust of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet sheonly gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusementin detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley'smarrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she hadwholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.</p><p>This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing atHartfield&mdash; the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, theirmutual good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself inthe periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!&mdash; Such a partnerin all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase ofmelancholy!</p><p>She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but everyblessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of herfriend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightfulfamily party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, inmere charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be aloser in every way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as anydeduction from her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would berather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, itseemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in sucha state of unmerited punishment.</p><p>In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;&mdash; not likeMr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so trulyconsiderate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshippedthan now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that shecould be in love with more than <i>three</i> men in one year.</p></body>
