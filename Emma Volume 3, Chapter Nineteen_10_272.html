<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Nineteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, amomentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of herattachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man fromunbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from therecurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the partyfrom London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one houralone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied&mdash;unaccountableas it was!&mdash; that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr.Knightley, and was now forming all her views of happiness.</p><p>Harriet was a little distressed&mdash;did look a little foolish at first:but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, andself-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away withthe words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with thefullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend'sapprobation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, bymeeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.&mdash; Harriet wasmost happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and thedinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.But what did such particulars explain?&mdash; The fact was, as Emma couldnow acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and thathis continuing to love her had been irresistible.&mdash;Beyond this, it mustever be unintelligible to Emma.</p><p>The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving herfresh reason for thinking so.&mdash;Harriet's parentage became known. Sheproved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her thecomfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough tohave always wished for concealment.&mdash;Such was the blood of gentilitywhich Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!&mdash; It was likely tobe as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what aconnexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley&mdash;or for theChurchills&mdash;or even for Mr. Elton!&mdash; The stain of illegitimacy,unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.</p><p>No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man wastreated liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma becameacquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, shefully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth whichcould bid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet'shappiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home heoffered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, andimprovement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, andoccupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led intotemptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectableand happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in theworld, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such aman;&mdash;or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.</p><p>Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.&mdash; Theintimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must changeinto a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, andmust be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, naturalmanner.</p><p>Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, andsaw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood beforethem, could impair.&mdash;Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr.Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fallon herself.&mdash;Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engagedof the three, were the first to be married.</p><p>Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to thecomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.&mdash;The Mr. Churchillswere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.</p><p>The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,by Emma and Mr. Knightley.&mdash;They had determined that their marriageought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, whichwas the plan.&mdash;John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreedin approving it. But Mr. Woodhouse&mdash;how was Mr. Woodhouse to be inducedto consent?&mdash;he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as adistant event.</p><p>When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that theywere almost hopeless.&mdash;A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.&mdash; Hebegan to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it&mdash; a verypromising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however,he was not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that hisdaughter's courage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, toknow him fancying himself neglected; and though her understandingalmost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, thatwhen once the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, shehesitated&mdash;she could not proceed.</p><p>In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any suddenillumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of hisnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in anotherway.&mdash; Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all herturkeys&mdash; evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in theneighbourhood also suffered.&mdash;Pilfering was <i>housebreaking</i> toMr. Woodhouse's fears.&mdash;He was very uneasy; and but for the sense ofhis son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm everynight of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind ofthe Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either ofthem protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.&mdash; But Mr. JohnKnightley must be in London again by the end of the first week inNovember.</p><p>The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at themoment, she was able to fix her wedding-day&mdash;and Mr. Elton was calledon, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, tojoin the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.</p><p>The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the partieshave no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from theparticulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,and very inferior to her own.&mdash;"Very little white satin, very few laceveils; a most pitiful business!&mdash;Selina would stare when she heard ofit."&mdash;But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, theconfidence, the predictions of the small band of true friends whowitnessed the ceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness ofthe union.</p><p><br />FINIS</p></body>
