<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Two</H2><p>Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectablefamily, which for the last two or three generations had been risinginto gentility and property. He had received a good education, but, onsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposedfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper byentering into the militia of his county, then embodied.</p><p>Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of hismilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a greatYorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody wassurprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, andwho were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.</p><p>Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command ofher fortune&mdash;though her fortune bore no proportion to thefamily-estate&mdash;was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it tookplace, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, whothrew her off with due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and didnot produce much happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it,for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him thinkevery thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being inlove with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not thebest. She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of herbrother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at thatbrother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of herformer home. They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothingin comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, butshe wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchillof Enscombe.</p><p>Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by theChurchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have muchthe worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years'marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child tomaintain. From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illnessof his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr.and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any otheryoung creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the wholecharge of the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples andsome reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but asthey were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up tothe care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his owncomfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.</p><p>A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militiaand engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good wayin London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concernwhich brought just employment enough. He had still a small house inHighbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between usefuloccupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twentyyears of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time,realised an easy competence&mdash;enough to secure the purchase of a littleestate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for&mdash;enough tomarry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live accordingto the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.</p><p>It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence hisschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, ithad not shaken his determination of never settling till he couldpurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they wereaccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtainedhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with everyprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He hadnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightfula well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him thepleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to bechosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.</p><p>He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was hisown; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as hisuncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assumethe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely,therefore, that he should ever want his father's assistance. His fatherhad no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, andgoverned her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature toimagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,and, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year inLondon, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fineyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He waslooked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits andprospects a kind of common concern.</p><p>Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a livelycuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so littlereturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visithis father had been often talked of but never achieved.</p><p>Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, asa most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There wasnot a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry dranktea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned thevisit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; andthe hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to hisnew mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit inHighbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston hadreceived. "I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. FrankChurchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a veryhandsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse sawthe letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in hislife."</p><p>It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasingattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a mostwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulationwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a mostfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunateshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partialseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, andwho could ill bear to part with her.</p><p>She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering anhour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma wasof no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation than mostgirls would have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits thatmight be hoped would bear her well and happily through its littledifficulties and privations. And then there was such comfort in thevery easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for evensolitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's disposition andcircumstances, which would make the approaching season no hindrance totheir spending half the evenings in the week together.</p><p>Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude toMrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction&mdash;hermore than satisfaction&mdash;her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and soapparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes takenby surprize at his being still able to pity `poor Miss Taylor,' whenthey left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, orsaw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to acarriage of her own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse'sgiving a gentle sigh, and saying, "Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would bevery glad to stay."</p><p>There was no recovering Miss Taylor&mdash;nor much likelihood of ceasingto pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased bybeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, whichhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach couldbear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to bedifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded asunfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuadethem from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, asearnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at thepains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr.Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits wereone of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the biasof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree withmany&mdash;perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such anopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influenceevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.</p><p>There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrysbeing seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands:but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.</p></body>
