<H2> Volume 2, Chapter One</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, inEmma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. Shecould not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more;and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as theyreturned;&mdash;but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter,and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive&mdash; "Mr. Elton is sogood to the poor!" she found something else must be done.</p><p>They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and MissBates. She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and MissBates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by thevery few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rathernegligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought tothe stock of their scanty comforts.</p><p>She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her ownheart, as to her deficiency&mdash;but none were equal to counteract thepersuasion of its being very disagreeable,&mdash;a waste of time&mdash;tiresomewomen&mdash; and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with thesecond-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them forever, and therefore she seldom went near them. But now she made thesudden resolution of not passing their door without goingin&mdash;observing, as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as shecould calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter fromJane Fairfax.</p><p>The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Batesoccupied the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sizedapartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were mostcordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, whowith her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even togive up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talkingdaughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanksfor their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries afterMr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her mother's, andsweet-cake from the beaufet&mdash;"Mrs. Cole had just been there, justcalled in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour withthem, and <i>she</i> had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as tosay she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouseand Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too."</p><p>The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr.Elton. There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr.Elton since his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must havethe letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and howmuch he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever hewent, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and shewent through it very well, with all the interest and all thecommendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward toprevent Harriet's being obliged to say a word.</p><p>This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; butmeant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no fartherincommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst allthe Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She hadnot been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he wasactually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at lastabruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.</p><p>"Oh! yes&mdash;Mr. Elton, I understand&mdash;certainly as to dancing&mdash; Mrs.Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was&mdash; Mrs. Colewas so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soonas she came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great afavourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know howto shew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it asmuch as any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly,saying, `I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it isnot her time for writing;' and when I immediately said, `But indeed wehave, we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever sawany body more surprized. `Have you, upon your honour?' said she; `well,that is quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.'"</p><p>Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest&mdash;</p><p>"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I hope she is well?"</p><p>"Thank you. You are so kind!" replied the happily deceived aunt,while eagerly hunting for the letter.&mdash;"Oh! here it is. I was sure itcould not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my handso very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I wasreading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading itagain to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her&mdash; a letter fromJane&mdash;that she can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could notbe far off, and here it is, only just under my huswife&mdash;and since youare so kind as to wish to hear what she says;&mdash;but, first of all, Ireally must, in justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short aletter&mdash;only two pages you see&mdash; hardly two&mdash;and in general she fillsthe whole paper and crosses half. My mother often wonders that I canmake it out so well. She often says, when the letter is first opened,`Well, Hetty, now I think you will be put to it to make out all thatchecker-work'&mdash; don't you, ma'am?&mdash;And then I tell her, I am sure shewould contrive to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it forher&mdash; every word of it&mdash;I am sure she would pore over it till she hadmade out every word. And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are not sogood as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God! withthe help of spectacles. It is such a blessing! My mother's are reallyvery good indeed. Jane often says, when she is here, `I am sure,grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do&mdash;and somuch fine work as you have done too!&mdash;I only wish my eyes may last meas well.'"</p><p>All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop forbreath; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of MissFairfax's handwriting.</p><p>"You are extremely kind," replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; "youwho are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am surethere is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as MissWoodhouse's. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know.Ma'am," addressing her, "do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obligingto say about Jane's handwriting?"</p><p>And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly complimentrepeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. Shewas pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seemingvery rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and hadalmost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse,when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.</p><p>"My mother's deafness is very trifling you see&mdash;just nothing at all.By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is veryremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama atall deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal atmy mother's time of life&mdash;and it really is full two years, you know,since she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before,and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enoughof her now."</p><p>"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?"</p><p>"Oh yes; next week."</p><p>"Indeed!&mdash;that must be a very great pleasure."</p><p>"Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is sosurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure shewill be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to seeher. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because ColonelCampbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. Sovery good of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, youknow. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about.That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, inthe common course, we should not have heard from her before nextTuesday or Wednesday."</p><p>"Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day."</p><p>"So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had notbeen for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here sosoon. My mother is so delighted!&mdash;for she is to be three months with usat least. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to havethe pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that theCampbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father andmother to come over and see her directly. They had not intended to goover till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again&mdash;fortill she married, last October, she was never away from them so much asa week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, Iwas going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote avery urgent letter to her mother&mdash;or her father, I declare I do notknow which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane's letter&mdash;wrotein Mr. Dixon's name as well as her own, to press their coming overdirectly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take themback to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean&mdash; Ido not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it wasvery natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own placewhile he was paying his addresses&mdash;and as Jane used to be very oftenwalking out with them&mdash;for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were veryparticular about their daughter's not walking out often with only Mr.Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard everything he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland;and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings ofthe place, views that he had taken himself. He is a most amiable,charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland,from his account of things."</p><p>At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma'sbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the notgoing to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of fartherdiscovery,</p><p>"You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowedto come to you at such a time. Considering the very particularfriendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expectedher to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."</p><p>"Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have alwaysbeen rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at sucha distance from us, for months together&mdash;not able to come if any thingwas to happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. Theywant her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel andMrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind orpressing than their <i>joint</i> invitation, Jane says, as you willhear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in anyattention. He is a most charming young man. Ever since the service herendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were out in that party on thewater, and she, by the sudden whirling round of something or otheramong the sails, would have been dashed into the sea at once, andactually was all but gone, if he had not, with the greatest presence ofmind, caught hold of her habit&mdash; (I can never think of it withouttrembling!)&mdash;But ever since we had the history of that day, I have beenso fond of Mr. Dixon!"</p><p>"But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish ofseeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs.Bates?"</p><p>"Yes&mdash;entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Coloneland Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they shouldrecommend; and indeed they particularly <i>wish</i> her to try her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately."</p><p>"I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has noremarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to becompared with Miss Fairfax."</p><p>"Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things&mdash;but certainlynot. There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always wasabsolutely plain&mdash;but extremely elegant and amiable."</p><p>"Yes, that of course."</p><p>"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th ofNovember, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been wellsince. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She nevermentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! soconsiderate!&mdash;But however, she is so far from well, that her kindfriends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an airthat always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or fourmonths at Highbury will entirely cure her&mdash; and it is certainly a greatdeal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she isunwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do."</p><p>"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world."</p><p>"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and theCampbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following&mdash; asyou will find from Jane's letter. So sudden!&mdash;You may guess, dear MissWoodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for thedrawback of her illness&mdash;but I am afraid we must expect to see hergrown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unluckything happened to me, as to that. I always make a point of readingJane's letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to mymother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distressher. Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-daywith my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of herbeing unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poorJane is ill!'&mdash; which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly,and was sadly alarmed at. However, when I read on, I found it was notnear so bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now toher, that she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how Icould be so off my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will callin Mr. Perry. The expense shall not be thought of; and though he is soliberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean tocharge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, youknow. He has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be givingaway his time. Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Janewrites about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells herown story a great deal better than I can tell it for her."</p><p>"I am afraid we must be running away," said Emma, glancing atHarriet, and beginning to rise&mdash;"My father will be expecting us. I hadno intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than fiveminutes, when I first entered the house. I merely called, because Iwould not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I havebeen so pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs.Bates good morning."</p><p>And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. Sheregained the street&mdash;happy in this, that though much had been forced onher against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substanceof Jane Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.</p></body>
