<H2> Volume 1, Chapter Sixteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down tothink and be miserable.&mdash;It was a wretched business indeed!&mdash;Such anoverthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!&mdash;Such a developmentof every thing most unwelcome!&mdash;Such a blow for Harriet!&mdash;that was theworst of all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of somesort or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light;and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken&mdash; more inerror&mdash;more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could theeffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.</p><p>"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could haveborne any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me&mdash; but poorHarriet!"</p><p>How she could have been so deceived!&mdash;He protested that he had neverthought seriously of Harriet&mdash;never! She looked back as well as shecould; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, shesupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, musthave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been somisled.</p><p>The picture!&mdash;How eager he had been about the picture!&mdash; and thecharade!&mdash;and an hundred other circumstances;&mdash; how clearly they hadseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its "readywit"&mdash;but then the "soft eyes"&mdash; in fact it suited neither; it was ajumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through suchthick-headed nonsense?</p><p>Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners toherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mereerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among othersthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all thegentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,till this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to meanany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.</p><p>To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on thesubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denyingthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightleyhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, theconviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marryindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of hischaracter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It wasdreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in manyrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and littleconcerned about the feelings of others.</p><p>Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to payhis addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions andhis proposals did him no service. She thought nothing of hisattachment, and was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, andhaving the arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love;but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointmentthat need be cared for. There had been no real affection either in hislanguage or manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance;but she could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any toneof voice, less allied with real love. She need not trouble herself topity him. He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if MissWoodhouse of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were notquite so easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for MissSomebody else with twenty, or with ten.</p><p>But&mdash;that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her asaware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), tomarry him!&mdash;should suppose himself her equal in connexion ormind!&mdash;look down upon her friend, so well understanding the gradationsof rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancyhimself shewing no presumption in addressing her!&mdash; It was mostprovoking.</p><p>Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he washer inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very wantof such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must knowthat in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He mustknow that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations atHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family&mdash;and that theEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly wasinconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, fromother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to DonwellAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouseshad long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhoodwhich Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way ashe could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommendhim to notice but his situation and his civility.&mdash; But he had fanciedher in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; andafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle mannersand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop andadmit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant andobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her realmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation anddelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.If <i>she</i> had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder that <i>he</i>, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers.</p><p>The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, itwas wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two peopletogether. It was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making lightof what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. Shewas quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.</p><p>"Here have I," said she, "actually talked poor Harriet into beingvery much attached to this man. She might never have thought of him butfor me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if Ihad not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humbleas I used to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuadingher not to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was welldone of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to timeand chance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her theopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to haveattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.I have been but half a friend to her; and if she were <i>not</i> tofeel this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea ofany body else who would be at all desirable for her;&mdash;William Coxe&mdash;Oh!no, I could not endure William Coxe&mdash; a pert young lawyer."</p><p>She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed amore serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and mightbe, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make toHarriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with theawkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing ordiscontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealingresentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in mostunmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at lastwith nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered mostdreadfully.</p><p>To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though undertemporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bringreturn of spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happyanalogy, and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignantenough to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open tosensations of softened pain and brighter hope.</p><p>Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she hadgone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, andto depend on getting tolerably out of it.</p><p>It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really inlove with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking todisappoint him&mdash;that Harriet's nature should not be of that superiorsort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive&mdash; and thatthere could be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passedexcept the three principals, and especially for her father's beinggiven a moment's uneasiness about it.</p><p>These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal ofsnow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcomethat might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.</p><p>The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, shecould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had hisdaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either excitingor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground coveredwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost andthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, everymorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in tofreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. Nointercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her onSunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses forMr. Elton's absenting himself.</p><p>It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; andthough she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in somesociety or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so wellsatisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stirout; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keepentirely from them,&mdash;</p><p>"Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?"</p><p>These days of confinement would have been, but for her privateperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suitedher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to hiscompanions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off hisill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him duringthe rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable andobliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopesof cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was stillsuch an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet,as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.</p></body>
