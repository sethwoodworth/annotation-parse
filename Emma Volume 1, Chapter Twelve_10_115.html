Emma's sense of right however had decided it;and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she hadparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreementbetween Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the properinvitation.</p><p>She hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time to make up. Making-up indeed would not do. <i>She</i> certainly had not been in the wrong, and <i>he</i>would never own that he had. Concession must be out of the question;but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled; andshe hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship, thatwhen he came into the room she had one of the children with her&mdash;theyoungest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who was now makingher first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced about in heraunt's arms. It did assist; for though he began with grave looks andshort questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usualway, and to take the child out of her arms with all theunceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again;and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then alittle sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring thebaby,</p><p>"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews andnieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree."</p><p>"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men andwomen, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealingswith them, as you are where these children are concerned, we mightalways think alike."</p><p>"To be sure&mdash;our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong."</p><p>"Yes," said he, smiling&mdash;"and reason good. I was sixteen years old when you were born."</p><p>"A material difference then," she replied&mdash;"and no doubt you weremuch my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does notthe lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good dealnearer?"</p><p>"Yes&mdash;a good deal <i>nearer</i>."</p><p>"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we think differently."</p><p>"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, andby not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dearEmma, let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt,little Emma, that she ought to set you a better example than to berenewing old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she isnow."</p><p>"That's true," she cried&mdash;"very true. Little Emma, grow up a betterwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as goodintentions went, we were <i>both</i> right, and I must say that noeffects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only wantto know that Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed."</p><p>"A man cannot be more so," was his short, full answer.</p><p>"Ah!&mdash;Indeed I am very sorry.&mdash;Come, shake hands with me."</p><p>This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when JohnKnightley made his appearance, and "How d'ye do, George?" and "John,how are you?" succeeded in the true English style, burying under acalmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment whichwould have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for thegood of the other.</p><p>The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declinedcards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella,and the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and hisdaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totallydistinct, or very rarely mixing&mdash;and Emma only occasionally joining inone or the other.</p><p>The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, butprincipally of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the mostcommunicative, and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate,he had generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand thehome-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear nextyear, and to give all such local information as could not fail of beinginteresting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longestpart of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of adrain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and thedestination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, wasentered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his coolermanners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him anything to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone ofeagerness.</p><p>While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse wasenjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with hisdaughter.</p><p>"My poor dear Isabella," said he, fondly taking her hand, andinterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of herfive children&mdash;"How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,my dear&mdash;and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.&mdash;You andI will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose weall have a little gruel."</p><p>Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that boththe Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article asherself;&mdash;and two basins only were ordered. After a little morediscourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not beingtaken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air ofgrave reflection,</p><p>"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn atSouth End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the seaair."</p><p>"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir&mdash;or we shouldnot have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularlyfor the weakness in little Bella's throat,&mdash; both sea air and bathing."</p><p>"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her anygood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, thoughperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of useto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once."</p><p>"Come, come," cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, "Imust beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious andmiserable;&mdash; I who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if youplease. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry aboutMr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you."</p><p>"Oh! good Mr. Perry&mdash;how is he, sir?"</p><p>"Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and hehas not time to take care of himself&mdash;he tells me he has not time totake care of himself&mdash;which is very sad&mdash;but he is always wanted allround the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practiceanywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where."</p><p>"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the childrengrow? I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be callingsoon. He will be so pleased to see my little ones."</p><p>"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two toask him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever hecomes, you had better let him look at little Bella's throat."</p><p>"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardlyany uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatestservice to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellentembrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been applying at timesever since August."</p><p>"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been ofuse to her&mdash;and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I wouldhave spoken to&mdash;</p><p>"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates," said Emma, "I have not heard one inquiry after them."</p><p>"Oh! the good Bateses&mdash;I am quite ashamed of myself&mdash;but you mentionthem in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.Bates&mdash;I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.&mdash;They arealways so pleased to see my children.&mdash; And that excellent MissBates!&mdash;such thorough worthy people!&mdash; How are they, sir?"</p><p>"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago."</p><p>"How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have beenthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them moregeneral or heavy&mdash;except when it has been quite an influenza."</p><p>"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degreeyou mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not soheavy as he has very often known them in November. Perry does not callit altogether a sickly season."</p><p>"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it <i>very</i> sickly except&mdash;</p><p>"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always asickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is adreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!&mdash; and theair so bad!"</p><p>"No, indeed&mdash;<i>we</i> are not at all in a bad air. Our part ofLondon is very superior to most others!&mdash;You must not confound us withLondon in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Squareis very different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! Ishould be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;&mdash;there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my childrenin: but <i>we</i> are so remarkably airy!&mdash;Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air."</p><p>"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it&mdash;but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of youdifferent creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say,that I think you are any of you looking well at present."</p><p>"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, exceptingthose little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am neverentirely free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if thechildren were rather pale before they went to bed, it was only becausethey were a little more tired than usual, from their journey and thehappiness of coming. I hope you will think better of their looksto-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did notbelieve he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust,at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill," turning hereyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.</p><p>"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well."</p><p>"What is the matter, sir?&mdash;Did you speak to me?" cried Mr. John Knightley, hearing his own name.</p><p>"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think youlooking well&mdash;but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. Icould have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr.Wingfield before you left home."</p><p>"My dear Isabella,"&mdash;exclaimed he hastily&mdash;"pray do not concernyourself about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddlingyourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse."</p><p>"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling yourbrother," cried Emma, "about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to havea bailiff from Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will itanswer? Will not the old prejudice be too strong?"</p><p>And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, whenforced to give her attention again to her father and sister, she hadnothing worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax;and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, shewas at that moment very happy to assist in praising.</p><p>"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!" said Mrs. John Knightley.&mdash; "Itis so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a momentaccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good oldgrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I alwaysregret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more atHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.Campbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such adelightful companion for Emma."</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,</p><p>"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such anotherpretty kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not havea better companion than Harriet."</p><p>"I am most happy to hear it&mdash;but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!&mdash;and exactly Emma's age."</p><p>This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded ofsimilar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the eveningdid not close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came andsupplied a great deal to be said&mdash;much praise and many comments&mdash;undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, andpretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never metwith tolerable;&mdash;but, unfortunately, among the failures which thedaughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore mostprominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman hired forthe time, who never had been able to understand what she meant by abasin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she hadwished for and ordered it, she had never been able to get any thingtolerable. Here was a dangerous opening.</p><p>"Ah!" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes onher with tender concern.&mdash;The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, "Ah!there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. Itdoes not bear talking of." And for a little while she hoped he wouldnot talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restorehim to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of someminutes, however, he began with,</p><p>"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn, instead of coming here."</p><p>"But why should you be sorry, sir?&mdash;I assure you, it did the children a great deal of good."</p><p>"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not havebeen to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprizedto hear you had fixed upon South End."</p><p>"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it isquite a mistake, sir.&mdash;We all had our health perfectly well there,never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfieldsays it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I amsure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature ofthe air, and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly."</p><p>"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.&mdash;Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of allthe sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air.And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite awayfrom the sea&mdash;a quarter of a mile off&mdash;very comfortable. You shouldhave consulted Perry."</p><p>"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;&mdash;only consider howgreat it would have been.&mdash;An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty."</p><p>"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing elseshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much tochuse between forty miles and an hundred.&mdash;Better not move at all,better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into aworse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a veryill-judged measure."</p><p>Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he hadreached such a point as this, she could not wonder at herbrother-in-law's breaking out.</p><p>"Mr. Perry," said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, "woulddo as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he makeit any business of his, to wonder at what I do?&mdash; at my taking myfamily to one part of the coast or another?&mdash;I may be allowed, I hope,the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.&mdash; I want his directions nomore than his drugs." He paused&mdash; and growing cooler in a moment,added, with only sarcastic dryness, "If Mr. Perry can tell me how toconvey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirtymiles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance offorty, I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he couldhimself."</p><p>"True, true," cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition&mdash;"very true. That's a consideration indeed.&mdash;But John, as to what I wastelling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning itmore to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows, Icannot conceive any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were tobe the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you callto mind exactly the present line of the path. . . . The only way ofproving it, however, will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you atthe Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we will look them over,and you shall give me your opinion."</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on hisfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, beenattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;&mdash; but thesoothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the presentevil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and betterrecollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.</p></body>
