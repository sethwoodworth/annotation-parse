<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Fifteen</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract herill opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct.Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such sheappeared whenever they met again,&mdash;self-important, presuming, familiar,ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a littleaccomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself comingwith superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a countryneighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place insociety as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.</p><p>There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differentlyfrom his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He hadthe air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman toHighbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater partof her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit ofjudging, following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it forgranted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as sheprofessed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton'spraise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded byMiss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talkedwith a good grace of her being "very pleasant and very elegantlydressed."</p><p>In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared atfirst. Her feelings altered towards Emma.&mdash;Offended, probably, by thelittle encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drewback in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; andthough the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it wasnecessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her manners, too&mdash;and Mr.Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering andnegligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but thesensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both verymuch.&mdash;It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had beenan offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story,under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing tohim, had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, theobject of their joint dislike.&mdash; When they had nothing else to say, itmust be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmitywhich they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broadervent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.</p><p>Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first.Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might besupposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she wasnot satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration&mdash; butwithout solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting toassist and befriend her.&mdash;Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, andabout the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton'sknight-errantry on the subject.&mdash;</p><p>"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.&mdash;I quite raveabout Jane Fairfax.&mdash;A sweet, interesting creature. So mild andladylike&mdash;and with such talents!&mdash;I assure you I think she has veryextraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremelywell. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! sheis absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth&mdash;but, upon my word,I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.&mdash; And her situation is socalculated to affect one!&mdash;Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves andendeavour to do something for her. We must bring her forward. Suchtalent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.&mdash;I dare say youhave heard those charming lines of the poet,</p><blockquote><p>`Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />`And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'</p></blockquote><p>We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax."</p><p>"I cannot think there is any danger of it," was Emma's calm answer&mdash;"and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation andunderstand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, Ihave no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown."</p><p>"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, suchobscurity, so thrown away.&mdash;Whatever advantages she may have enjoyedwith the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that shefeels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I mustconfess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate fortimidity&mdash;and I am sure one does not often meet with it.&mdash;But in thosewho are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assureyou, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me morethan I can express."</p><p>"You appear to feel a great deal&mdash;but I am not aware how you or anyof Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known herlonger than yourself, can shew her any other attention than"&mdash;</p><p>"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act. You and I need not be afraid. If <i>we</i> set the example, many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. <i>We</i> have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and <i>we</i>live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, atany time, the least inconvenient.&mdash;I should be extremely displeased ifWright were to send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret havingasked <i>more</i> than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of thing. It is not likely that I <i>should</i>,considering what I have been used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, inhousekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and beingtoo careless of expense. Maple Grove will probably be my model morethan it ought to be&mdash; for we do not at all affect to equal my brother,Mr. Suckling, in income.&mdash;However, my resolution is taken as tonoticing Jane Fairfax.&mdash; I shall certainly have her very often at myhouse, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall have musical partiesto draw out her talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for aneligible situation. My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I havelittle doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.&mdash;I shallintroduce her, of course, very particularly to my brother and sisterwhen they come to us. I am sure they will like her extremely; and whenshe gets a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wearoff, for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what ishighly conciliating.&mdash;I shall have her very often indeed while they arewith me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in thebarouche-landau in some of our exploring parties."</p><p>"Poor Jane Fairfax!"&mdash;thought Emma.&mdash;"You have not deserved this.You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is apunishment beyond what you can have merited!&mdash;The kindness andprotection of Mrs. Elton!&mdash;`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens!Let me not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!&mdash;But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of thatwoman's tongue!"</p><p>Emma had not to listen to such paradings again&mdash;to any soexclusively addressed to herself&mdash;so disgustingly decorated with a"dear Miss Woodhouse." The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwardsappeared, and she was left in peace&mdash;neither forced to be the veryparticular friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, thevery active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others ina general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what wasdone.</p><p>She looked on with some amusement.&mdash;Miss Bates's gratitude for Mrs.Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guilelesssimplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies&mdash; the mostamiable, affable, delightful woman&mdash;just as accomplished andcondescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's onlysurprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions andtolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking withthe Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons!This was astonishing!&mdash;She could not have believed it possible that thetaste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society andfriendship as the Vicarage had to offer.</p><p>"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!" said she.&mdash;"To chuse to remainhere month after month, under privations of every sort! And now tochuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of herconversation, rather than return to the superior companions who havealways loved her with such real, generous affection."</p><p>Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; theCampbells were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbellshad promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and freshinvitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to MissBates&mdash;it all came from her&mdash;Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friendscontrived&mdash;no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she haddeclined it!</p><p>"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusingthis invitation," was Emma's conclusion. "She must be under some sortof penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There isgreat fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.&mdash; She is <i>not</i> to be with the <i>Dixons</i>. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?&mdash;Here is quite a separate puzzle."</p><p>Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject,before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston venturedthis apology for Jane.</p><p>"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,my dear Emma&mdash;but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is agood creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. Wemust consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste forwhat she goes to."</p><p>"You are right, Mrs. Weston," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "MissFairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs.Elton. Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not havechosen her. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receivesattentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her."</p><p>Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; andshe was herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presentlyreplied,</p><p>"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, wouldrather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations Ishould have imagined any thing but inviting."</p><p>"I should not wonder," said Mrs. Weston, "if Miss Fairfax were tohave been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagernessin accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may verylikely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greaterappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, inspite of the very natural wish of a little change."</p><p>Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few minutes silence, he said,</p><p>"Another thing must be taken into consideration too&mdash;Mrs. Elton does not talk <i>to</i> Miss Fairfax as she speaks <i>of</i>her. We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she andthou, the plainest spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of asomething beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with eachother&mdash; a something more early implanted. We cannot give any body thedisagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before.We feel things differently. And besides the operation of this, as ageneral principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton byher superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs.Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to. Such awoman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton's waybefore&mdash;and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her owncomparative littleness in action, if not in consciousness."</p><p>"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax," said Emma. LittleHenry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made herirresolute what else to say.</p><p>"Yes," he replied, "any body may know how highly I think of her."</p><p>"And yet," said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, butsoon stopping&mdash;it was better, however, to know the worst at once&mdash; shehurried on&mdash;"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself howhighly it is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprizesome day or other."</p><p>Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thickleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, orsome other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,</p><p>"Oh! are you there?&mdash;But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago."</p><p>He stopped.&mdash;Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not herself know what to think. In a moment he went on&mdash;</p><p>"That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I daresay, would not have me if I were to ask her&mdash;and I am very sure I shallnever ask her."</p><p>Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased enough to exclaim,</p><p>"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you."</p><p>He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful&mdash;and in a manner which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,</p><p>"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?"</p><p>"No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much formatch-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What Isaid just now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course,without any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have notthe smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. Youwould not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you weremarried."</p><p>Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was,"No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will evertake me by surprize.&mdash;I never had a thought of her in that way, Iassure you." And soon afterwards, "Jane Fairfax is a very charmingyoung woman&mdash;but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. Shehas not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife."</p><p>Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. "Well," said she, "and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?"</p><p>"Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he wasmistaken; he asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to bewiser or wittier than his neighbours."</p><p>"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiserand wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles&mdash;what she calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deepenough in familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley&mdash;what can she dofor Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax acceptsher civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argumentweighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptationof getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph ofMiss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton'sacknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in herbeing under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitorwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not becontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuringher a permanent situation to the including her in those delightfulexploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau."</p><p>"Jane Fairfax has feeling," said Mr. Knightley&mdash;"I do not accuse herof want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong&mdash;and hertemper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-controul;but it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, thanshe used to be&mdash;And I love an open temper. No&mdash;till Cole alluded to mysupposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfaxand conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always&mdash;but withno thought beyond."</p><p>"Well, Mrs. Weston," said Emma triumphantly when he left them, "what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?"</p><p>"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of <i>not</i> being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me."</p></body>
