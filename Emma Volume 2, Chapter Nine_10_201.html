<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Nine</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. Thevisit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and allthat she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignifiedseclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. Shemust have delighted the Coles&mdash;worthy people, who deserved to be madehappy!&mdash;And left a name behind her that would not soon die away.</p><p>Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were twopoints on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had nottransgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions ofJane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but ithad been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and hissubmission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration,which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought tohave held her tongue.</p><p>The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; andthere she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regretthe inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartilygrieve over the idleness of her childhood&mdash;and sat down and practisedvigorously an hour and a half.</p><p>She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet'spraise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.</p><p>"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!"</p><p>"Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her's, than a lamp is like sunshine."</p><p>"Oh! dear&mdash;I think you play the best of the two. I think you playquite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Everybody last night said how well you played."</p><p>"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to bepraised, but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it."</p><p>"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does,or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr.Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked agreat deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more thanexecution."</p><p>"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet."</p><p>"Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she hadany taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.&mdash; Thereis no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so verywell, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because shewill have to teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether shewould get into any great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?"</p><p>"Just as they always do&mdash;very vulgar."</p><p>"They told me something," said Harriet rather hesitatingly;" but it is nothing of any consequence."</p><p>Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its producing Mr. Elton.</p><p>"They told me&mdash;that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday."</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>"He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay to dinner."</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>"They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do notknow what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and staythere again next summer."</p><p>"She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should be."</p><p>"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat byher at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very gladto marry him."</p><p>"Very likely.&mdash;I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar girls in Highbury."</p><p>Harriet had business at Ford's.&mdash;Emma thought it most prudent to gowith her. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, andin her present state, would be dangerous.</p><p>Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, wasalways very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging overmuslins and changing her mind, Emma went to the door foramusement.&mdash;Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even thebusiest part of Highbury;&mdash; Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. WilliamCox letting himself in at the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horsesreturning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule,were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect; and when hereyes fell only on the butcher with his tray, a tidy old womantravelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two cursquarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children roundthe baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she hadno reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still tostand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeingnothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.</p><p>She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two personsappeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking intoHighbury;&mdash;to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in thefirst place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Randallsthan Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught theireye.&mdash;Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; andthe agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give freshpleasure to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she wasgoing to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.</p><p>"For my companion tells me," said she, "that I absolutely promisedMiss Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not awareof it myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says Idid, I am going now."</p><p>"And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,"said Frank Churchill, "to join your party and wait for her atHartfield&mdash; if you are going home."</p><p>Mrs. Weston was disappointed.</p><p>"I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased."</p><p>"Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps&mdash;I may be equally inthe way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My auntalways sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her todeath; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same.What am I to do?"</p><p>"I am here on no business of my own," said Emma; "I am only waitingfor my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall gohome. But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument."</p><p>"Well&mdash;if you advise it.&mdash;But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbellshould have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to havean indifferent tone&mdash;what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth wouldbe palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in theworld at a civil falsehood."</p><p>"I do not believe any such thing," replied Emma.&mdash;"I am persuadedthat you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary;but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quiteotherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night."</p><p>"Do come with me," said Mrs. Weston, "if it be not very disagreeableto you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards.We will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. Itwill be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it."</p><p>He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in,and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,&mdash;trying, with allthe force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plainmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, beit ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. Atlast it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.</p><p>"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?" asked Mrs. Ford.&mdash;"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield.No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs.Goddard will want to see it.&mdash;And I could take the pattern gown homeany day. But I shall want the ribbon directly&mdash; so it had better go toHartfield&mdash;at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,Mrs. Ford, could not you?"</p><p>"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels."</p><p>"No more it is."</p><p>"No trouble in the world, ma'am," said the obliging Mrs. Ford.</p><p>"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, ifyou please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's&mdash; I do notknow&mdash;No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent toHartfield, and take it home with me at night. What do you advise?"</p><p>"That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford."</p><p>"Aye, that will be much best," said Harriet, quite satisfied, "I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's."</p><p>Voices approached the shop&mdash;or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.</p><p>"My dear Miss Woodhouse," said the latter, "I am just run across toentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. Howdo you do, Miss Smith?&mdash;Very well I thank you.&mdash;And I begged Mrs.Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding."</p><p>"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are&mdash;"</p><p>"Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfullywell; and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?&mdash;I amso glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you werehere.&mdash; Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhousewill allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my motherwill be so very happy to see her&mdash;and now we are such a nice party, shecannot refuse.&mdash;`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, `MissWoodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'&mdash; But,said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go withme.&mdash;`Oh,' said he, `wait half a minute, till I have finished myjob;'&mdash;For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in themost obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of mymother's spectacles.&mdash;The rivet came out, you know, this morning.&mdash; Sovery obliging!&mdash;For my mother had no use of her spectacles&mdash; could notput them on. And, by the bye, every body ought to have two pair ofspectacles; they should indeed. Jane said so. I meant to take them overto John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or other hinderedme all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no sayingwhat, you know. At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchenchimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your badnews to me. Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out. Thenthe baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they areextremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises, always&mdash;I have heardsome people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rudeanswer, but we have never known any thing but the greatest attentionfrom them. And it cannot be for the value of our custom now, for whatis our consumption of bread, you know? Only three of us.&mdash; besides dearJane at present&mdash;and she really eats nothing&mdash;makes such a shockingbreakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it. I dare not letmy mother know how little she eats&mdash;so I say one thing and then I sayanother, and it passes off. But about the middle of the day she getshungry, and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples,and they are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the otherday of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet him in the street. Not thatI had any doubt before&mdash; I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommenda baked apple. I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinksthe fruit thoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, veryoften. Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, youhave prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will oblige us."</p><p>Emma would be "very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &amp;c.," and theydid at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Batesthan,</p><p>"How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see youbefore. I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town.Jane came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do verywell&mdash;only a little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking themin."</p><p>"What was I talking of?" said she, beginning again when they were all in the street.</p><p>Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.</p><p>"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.&mdash;Oh! mymother's spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! `Oh!'said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kindexcessively.'&mdash;Which you know shewed him to be so very. . . . Indeed Imust say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I hadexpected, he very far exceeds any thing. . . . I do congratulate you,Mrs. Weston, most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parentcould. . . . `Oh!' said he, `I can fasten the rivet. I like a job ofthat sort excessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when Ibrought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friendswould be so very obliging as to take some, `Oh!' said he directly,`there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are thefinest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, youknow, was so very. . . . And I am sure, by his manner, it was nocompliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallisdoes them full justice&mdash;only we do not have them baked more than twice,and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times&mdash; butMiss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The applesthemselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; allfrom Donwell&mdash;some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends usa sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping appleanywhere as one of his trees&mdash;I believe there is two of them. My mothersays the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I wasreally quite shocked the other day&mdash; for Mr. Knightley called onemorning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them andsaid how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got tothe end of our stock. `I am sure you must be,' said he, `and I willsend you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can everuse. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual thisyear. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.' SoI begged he would not&mdash;for really as to ours being gone, I could notabsolutely say that we had a great many left&mdash;it was but half a dozenindeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at allbear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had beenalready; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almostquarrelled with me&mdash;No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had aquarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned theapples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had agreat many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could.However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a largebasket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I wasvery much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and saidevery thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an oldacquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I foundafterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of <i>that</i>sort his master had; he had brought them all&mdash;and now his master hadnot one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it himself,he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William,you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing; but Mrs.Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away. Shecould not bear that her master should not be able to have anotherapple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not mind it,and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges <i>would</i>be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold, it did notsignify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me, and I wasexcessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley know anything about it for the world! He would be so very. . . . I wanted tokeep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned itbefore I was aware."</p><p>Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitorswalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.</p><p>"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Praytake care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase&mdash; ratherdarker and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care.Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. MissSmith, the step at the turning."</p></body>
