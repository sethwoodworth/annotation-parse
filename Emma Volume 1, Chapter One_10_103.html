<H2> Volume 1, Chapter One</H2><p>Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable homeand happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings ofexistence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with verylittle to distress or vex her.</p><p>She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother haddied too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembranceof her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent womanas governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.</p><p>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, lessas a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, butparticularly of Emma. Between <i>them</i> it was more the intimacy ofsisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal officeof governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her toimpose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passedaway, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutuallyattached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming MissTaylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.</p><p>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of havingrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little toowell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy toher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present sounperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes withher.</p><p>Sorrow came&mdash;a gentle sorrow&mdash;but not at all in the shape of anydisagreeable consciousness.&mdash;Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor'sloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of thisbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of anycontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her fatherand herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third tocheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep afterdinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what shehad lost.</p><p>The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Westonwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, andpleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering withwhat self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished andpromoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The wantof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled herpast kindness&mdash;the kindness, the affection of sixteen years&mdash;how shehad taught and how she had played with her from five years old&mdash;how shehad devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health&mdash;and hownursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt ofgratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followedIsabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet adearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion suchas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowingall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, andpeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme ofhers&mdash;one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and whohad such an affection for her as could never find fault.</p><p>How was she to bear the change?&mdash;It was true that her friend wasgoing only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must bethe difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and aMiss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural anddomestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectualsolitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.</p><p>The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhousehad not married early) was much increased by his constitution andhabits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activityof mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; andthough everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and hisamiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.</p><p>Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond herdaily reach; and many a long October and November evening must bestruggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visitfrom Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill thehouse, and give her pleasant society again.</p><p>Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to atown, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, andshrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. TheWoodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. Shehad many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universallycivil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of MissTaylor for even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma couldnot but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her fatherawoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits requiredsupport. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every bodythat he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change ofevery kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was alwaysdisagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his owndaughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion,though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was nowobliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentleselfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people couldfeel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think MissTaylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would havebeen a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life atHartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keephim from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for himnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner,</p><p>"Poor Miss Taylor!&mdash;I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"</p><p>"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston issuch a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughlydeserves a good wife;&mdash;and you would not have had Miss Taylor live withus for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a houseof her own?"</p><p>"A house of her own!&mdash;But where is the advantage of a house of herown? This is three times as large.&mdash;And you have never any odd humours,my dear."</p><p>"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!&mdash;We shall be always meeting! <i>We</i> must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon."</p><p>"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could not walk half so far."</p><p>"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to be sure."</p><p>"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for sucha little way;&mdash;and where are the poor horses to be while we are payingour visit?"</p><p>"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we havesettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston lastnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like goingto Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I onlydoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till youmentioned her&mdash;James is so obliged to you!"</p><p>"I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I wouldnot have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and Iam sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her,she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; andwhen you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turnsthe lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure shewill be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poorMiss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see.Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will behearing of us. He will be able to tell her how we all are."</p><p>Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, andhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably throughthe evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. Thebackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwardswalked in and made it unnecessary.</p><p>Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, wasnot only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularlyconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He livedabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from theirmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, aftersome days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all werewell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, whichalways did him good; and his many inquiries after "poor Isabella" andher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.Woodhouse gratefully observed, "It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you musthave had a shocking walk."</p><p>"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire."</p><p>"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch cold."</p><p>"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them."</p><p>"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rainhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were atbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding."</p><p>"By the bye&mdash;I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware ofwhat sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry withmy congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How didyou all behave? Who cried most?"</p><p>"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business."</p><p>"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possiblysay `poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; butwhen it comes to the question of dependence or independence!&mdash;At anyrate, it must be better to have only one to please than two."</p><p>"Especially when <i>one</i> of those two is such a fanciful,troublesome creature!" said Emma playfully. "That is what you have inyour head, I know&mdash;and what you would certainly say if my father werenot by."</p><p>"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed," said Mr. Woodhouse,with a sigh. "I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."</p><p>"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean <i>you</i>, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean <i>you</i>.What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only myself. Mr. Knightley lovesto find fault with me, you know&mdash; in a joke&mdash;it is all a joke. Wealways say what we like to one another."</p><p>Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could seefaults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, sheknew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not havehim really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfectby every body.</p><p>"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightley, "but I meantno reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have twopersons to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that shemust be a gainer."</p><p>"Well," said Emma, willing to let it pass&mdash;"you want to hear aboutthe wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behavedcharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt thatwe were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meetingevery day."</p><p>"Dear Emma bears every thing so well," said her father. "But, Mr.Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I amsure she <i>will</i> miss her more than she thinks for."</p><p>Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. "It isimpossible that Emma should not miss such a companion," said Mr.Knightley. "We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we couldsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor'sadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor'stime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important toher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allowherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylormust be glad to have her so happily married."</p><p>"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me," said Emma, "and avery considerable one&mdash;that I made the match myself. I made the match,you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved inthe right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,may comfort me for any thing."</p><p>Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, "Ah!my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, forwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any morematches."</p><p>"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And aftersuch success, you know!&mdash;Every body said that Mr. Weston would nevermarry again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long,and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantlyoccupied either in his business in town or among his friends here,always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful&mdash; Mr. Weston neednot spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Ohno! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people eventalked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the sonand the uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talkedon the subject, but I believed none of it.</p><p>"Ever since the day&mdash;about four years ago&mdash;that Miss Taylor and Imet with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, hedarted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for usfrom Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned thematch from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in thisinstance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave offmatch-making."</p><p>"I do not understand what you mean by `success,'" said Mr.Knightley. "Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly anddelicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four yearsto bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady'smind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as youcall it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idleday, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr.Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every nowand then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit?What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and <i>that</i> is all that can be said."</p><p>"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a luckyguess?&mdash; I pity you.&mdash;I thought you cleverer&mdash;for, depend upon it alucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it.And as to my poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not knowthat I am so entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn twopretty pictures; but I think there may be a third&mdash;a something betweenthe do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston'svisits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed manylittle matters, it might not have come to any thing after all. I thinkyou must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that."</p><p>"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage theirown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, thangood to them, by interference."</p><p>"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,"rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. "But, my dear, praydo not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one'sfamily circle grievously."</p><p>"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You likeMr. Elton, papa,&mdash;I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobodyin Highbury who deserves him&mdash;and he has been here a whole year, andhas fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame tohave him single any longer&mdash;and I thought when he was joining theirhands to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have thesame kind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and thisis the only way I have of doing him a service."</p><p>"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very goodyoung man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shewhim any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be sokind as to meet him."</p><p>"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time," said Mr.Knightley, laughing, "and I agree with you entirely, that it will be amuch better thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the bestof the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care ofhimself."</p></body>
