<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Ten</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, wastranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table nearher, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.</p><p>Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again.</p><p>"This is a pleasure," said he, in rather a low voice, "coming atleast ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying tobe useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed."</p><p>"What!" said Mrs. Weston, "have not you finished it yet? you wouldnot earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate."</p><p>"I have not been working uninterruptedly," he replied, "I have beenassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You seewe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you tobe persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home."</p><p>He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficientlyemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying tomake her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quiteready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediatelyready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she hadnot yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it withoutemotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; andEmma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and couldnot but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.</p><p>At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, thepowers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joinedher in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every properdiscrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.</p><p>"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ," said Frank Churchill, witha smile at Emma, "the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal ofColonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the uppernotes I am sure is exactly what he and <i>all</i> <i>that</i> <i>party</i>would particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gavehis friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Donot you think so?"</p><p>Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment.</p><p>"It is not fair," said Emma, in a whisper; "mine was a random guess. Do not distress her."</p><p>He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,</p><p>"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure onthis occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, andwonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument'scoming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business tobe going forward just at this time?&mdash;Do you imagine it to be theconsequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may havesent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, todepend upon contingencies and conveniences?"</p><p>He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,</p><p>"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell," said she, in a voiceof forced calmness, "I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It mustbe all conjecture."</p><p>"Conjecture&mdash;aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes oneconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make thisrivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard atwork, if one talks at all;&mdash;your real workmen, I suppose, hold theirtongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word&mdash;MissFairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I havethe pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles,healed for the present."</p><p>He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape alittle from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged MissFairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.</p><p>"If you are very kind," said he, "it will be one of the waltzes wedanced last night;&mdash;let me live them over again. You did not enjoy themas I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad wedanced no longer; but I would have given worlds&mdash; all the worlds oneever has to give&mdash;for another half-hour."</p><p>She played.</p><p>"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which <i>has</i> made one happy!&mdash; If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth."</p><p>She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and playedsomething else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,and turning to Emma, said,</p><p>"Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?&mdash;Cramer.&mdash; Andhere are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, onemight expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful ofColonel Campbell, was not it?&mdash;He knew Miss Fairfax could have no musichere. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it tohave been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothingincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it."</p><p>Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help beingamused; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caughtthe remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush ofconsciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had lessscruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect toher.&mdash;This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparentlycherishing very reprehensible feelings.</p><p>He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.&mdash; Emma took the opportunity of whispering,</p><p>"You speak too plain. She must understand you."</p><p>"I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning."</p><p>"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea."</p><p>"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I havenow a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If shedoes wrong, she ought to feel it."</p><p>"She is not entirely without it, I think."</p><p>"I do not see much sign of it. She is playing <i>Robin</i> <i>Adair</i> at this moment&mdash;<i>his</i> favourite."</p><p>Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off.</p><p>"Mr. Knightley I declare!&mdash;I must speak to him if possible, just tothank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;but I can go into my mother's room you know. I dare say he will come inwhen he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meetso!&mdash;Our little room so honoured!"</p><p>She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and openingthe casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, andevery syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by theothers, as if it had passed within the same apartment.</p><p>"How d' ye do?&mdash;how d'ye do?&mdash;Very well, I thank you. So obliged toyou for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother justready for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friendshere."</p><p>So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heardin his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,</p><p>"How is your niece, Miss Bates?&mdash;I want to inquire after you all,but particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?&mdash;I hope she caught nocold last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is."</p><p>And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he wouldhear her in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Westongave Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her headin steady scepticism.</p><p>"So obliged to you!&mdash;so very much obliged to you for the carriage," resumed Miss Bates.</p><p>He cut her short with,</p><p>"I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?"</p><p>"Oh! dear, Kingston&mdash;are you?&mdash;Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston."</p><p>"Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for <i>you</i>?"</p><p>"No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?&mdash; MissWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the newpianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in."</p><p>"Well," said he, in a deliberating manner, "for five minutes, perhaps."</p><p>"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!&mdash;Quite delightful; so many friends!"</p><p>"No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can."</p><p>"Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you."</p><p>"No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the pianoforte."</p><p>"Well, I am so sorry!&mdash;Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful partylast night; how extremely pleasant.&mdash;Did you ever see such dancing?&mdash;Was not it delightful?&mdash;Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I neversaw any thing equal to it."</p><p>"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I supposeMiss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing thatpasses. And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why MissFairfax should not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances verywell; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player, withoutexception, in England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, theywill say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannotstay to hear it."</p><p>"Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence&mdash; so shocked!&mdash;Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!"</p><p>"What is the matter now?"</p><p>"To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you hada great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. Youshould not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He nevercan bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and itwould have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . Well, (returning tothe room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop.He is going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing. . . ."</p><p>"Yes," said Jane, "we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing."</p><p>"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the doorwas open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. Youmust have heard every thing to be sure. `Can I do any thing for you atKingston?' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . Oh! Miss Woodhouse, mustyou be going?&mdash;You seem but just come&mdash;so very obliging of you."</p><p>Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had alreadylasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning wasperceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leavealso, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies toHartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.</p></body>
