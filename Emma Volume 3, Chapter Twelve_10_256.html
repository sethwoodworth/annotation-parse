<H2> Volume 3, Chapter Twelve</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being <i>first</i>with Mr. Knightley, first in interest and affection.&mdash;Satisfied that itwas so, and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection;and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressiblyimportant it had been.&mdash;Long, very long, she felt she had been first;for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been onlyIsabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she had alwaysknown exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herselfbeen first with him for many years past. She had not deserved it; shehad often been negligent or perverse, slighting his advice, or evenwilfully opposing him, insensible of half his merits, and quarrellingwith him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolentestimate of her own&mdash;but still, from family attachment and habit, andthorough excellence of mind, he had loved her, and watched over herfrom a girl, with an endeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for herdoing right, which no other creature had at all shared. In spite of allher faults, she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, verydear?&mdash; When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here,presented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them. HarrietSmith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly,exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley. <i>She</i> could not. She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to <i>her</i>.She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.&mdash; How shockedhad he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how stronglyhad he expressed himself to her on the subject!&mdash;Not too strongly forthe offence&mdash;but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softerthan upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.&mdash; She had no hope,nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could have that sort ofaffection for herself which was now in question; but there was a hope(at times a slight one, at times much stronger,) that Harriet mighthave deceived herself, and be overrating his regard for <i>her</i>.&mdash;Wishit she must, for his sake&mdash;be the consequence nothing to herself, buthis remaining single all his life. Could she be secure of that, indeed,of his never marrying at all, she believed she should be perfectlysatisfied.&mdash;Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and herfather, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell andHartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship andconfidence, and her peace would be fully secured.&mdash;Marriage, in fact,would not do for her. It would be incompatible with what she owed toher father, and with what she felt for him. Nothing should separate herfrom her father. She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr.Knightley.</p><p>It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; andshe hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might atleast be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.&mdash;She shouldsee them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly asshe had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did notknow how to admit that she could be blinded here.&mdash; He was expectedback every day. The power of observation would be soongiven&mdash;frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in onecourse. In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.&mdash; Itwould do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good, to betalking of it farther.&mdash;She was resolved not to be convinced, as longas she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet'sconfidence. To talk would be only to irritate.&mdash;She wrote to her,therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not, atpresent, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction, thatall farther confidential discussion of <i>one</i> topic had better beavoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass beforethey met again, except in the company of others&mdash;she objected only to atete-a-tete&mdash;they might be able to act as if they had forgotten theconversation of yesterday.&mdash;Harriet submitted, and approved, and wasgrateful.</p><p>This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma'sthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours&mdash;Mrs. Weston, who hadbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in herway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, torelate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.</p><p>Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through hisshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having theninduced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned withmuch more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than aquarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all theencumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.</p><p>A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while herfriend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good dealof agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go atall at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead,and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, andMr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known;as, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paidwithout leading to reports:&mdash; but Mr. Weston had thought differently;he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax andher family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited byit; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for "suchthings," he observed, "always got about." Emma smiled, and felt thatMr. Weston had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, inshort&mdash;and very great had been the evident distress and confusion ofthe lady. She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look andaction had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness. Thequiet, heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturousdelight of her daughter&mdash;who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were bothso truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in everysensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and solittle of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them.Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Westonto invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first,but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive,Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of herembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their firstreception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was alwaysfeeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open thecause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a gooddeal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs.Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest reliefto her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had solong been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on thesubject.</p><p>"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment ofso many months," continued Mrs. Weston, "she was energetic. This wasone of her expressions. `I will not say, that since I entered into theengagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that Ihave never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'&mdash; and thequivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I feltat my heart."</p><p>"Poor girl!" said Emma. "She thinks herself wrong, then, for having consented to a private engagement?"</p><p>"Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposedto blame herself. `The consequence,' said she, `has been a state ofperpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all thepunishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been actingcontrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that everything has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what myconscience tells me ought not to be.' `Do not imagine, madam,' shecontinued, `that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall onthe principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The errorhas been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse thatpresent circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making thestory known to Colonel Campbell.'"</p><p>"Poor girl!" said Emma again. "She loves him then excessively, Isuppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be ledto form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered herjudgment."</p><p>"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him."</p><p>"I am afraid," returned Emma, sighing, "that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy."</p><p>"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But sheprobably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to themisunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One naturalconsequence of the evil she had involved herself in," she said, "wasthat of making her <i>unreasonable</i>. The consciousness of havingdone amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made hercaptious and irritable to a degree that must have been&mdash; that hadbeen&mdash;hard for him to bear. `I did not make the allowances,' said she,`which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits&mdash; hisdelightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition,which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure, have been asconstantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.' She then began tospeak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn her during herillness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected,desired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank you&mdash;I could notthank you too much&mdash;for every wish and every endeavour to do her good.She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgmentfrom herself."</p><p>"If I did not know her to be happy now," said Emma, seriously,"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulousconscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;&mdash;for, oh! Mrs.Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good Ihave done Miss Fairfax!&mdash;Well (checking herself, and trying to be morelively), this is all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring methese interesting particulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage.I am sure she is very good&mdash; I hope she will be very happy. It is fitthat the fortune should be on his side, for I think the merit will beall on hers."</p><p>Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. Shethought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, sheloved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. Shetalked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection&mdash; butshe had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone toBrunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; andwhen Mrs. Weston ended with, "We have not yet had the letter we are soanxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come," she was obligedto pause before she answered, and at last obliged to answer at random,before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were soanxious for.</p><p>"Are you well, my Emma?" was Mrs. Weston's parting question.</p><p>"Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible."</p><p>Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food forunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and hersense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regrettednot having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for theenvious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attentionto Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know herbetter; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured tofind a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in allprobability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on hernow.&mdash;Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one asan associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and theother&mdash;what was she?&mdash;Supposing even that they had never becomeintimate friends; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax'sconfidence on this important matter&mdash; which was most probable&mdash;still,in knowing her as she ought, and as she might, she must have beenpreserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment toMr. Dixon, which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harbouredherself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatlyfeared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy ofJane's feelings, by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Ofall the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her coming toHighbury, she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst.She must have been a perpetual enemy. They never could have been allthree together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in athousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony ofa mind that would bear no more.</p><p>The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in,and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which thewind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made suchcruel sights the longer visible.</p><p>The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kepttolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter'sside, and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before. Itreminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs.Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon aftertea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightfulproofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed,might shortly be over. The picture which she had then drawn of theprivations of the approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friendshad deserted them, no pleasures had been lost.&mdash;But her presentforebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction. Theprospect before her now, was threatening to a degree that could not beentirely dispelled&mdash; that might not be even partially brightened. Ifall took place that might take place among the circle of her friends,Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer herfather with the spirits only of ruined happiness.</p><p>The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearerthan herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it.They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husbandalso.&mdash;Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and MissFairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong toHighbury. They would be married, and settled either at or nearEnscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to theselosses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain ofcheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to beno longer coming there for his evening comfort!&mdash; No longer walking inat all hours, as if ever willing to change his own home fortheir's!&mdash;How was it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to themfor Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as findingin Harriet's society all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be thechosen, the first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he lookedfor all the best blessings of existence; what could be increasingEmma's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind,that it had been all her own work?</p><p>When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrainfrom a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room fora few seconds&mdash;and the only source whence any thing like consolation orcomposure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own betterconduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety mightbe the following and every future winter of her life to the past, itwould yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, andleave her less to regret when it were gone.</p></body>
