<H2> Volume 3, Chapter One</H2><p><br clear="&quot;all&quot;" /></p><p>A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to thenature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. Shewas soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at allapprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment hadreally subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;&mdash;but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love ofthe two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment whichhe had taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of twomonths should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils beforeher:&mdash;caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did notmean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would beincumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.</p><p>She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolutedeclaration. That would be so very painful a conclusion of theirpresent acquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipatingsomething decisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass withoutbringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composedand tranquil state.</p><p>It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston hadforeseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of FrankChurchill's feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite sosoon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.He rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as hecame from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exerciseall her quick observation, and speedily determine how he wasinfluenced, and how she must act. They met with the utmostfriendliness. There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeingher. But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as hehad done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree. Shewatched him well. It was a clear thing he was less in love than he hadbeen. Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference, hadproduced this very natural and very desirable effect.</p><p>He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, andseemed delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to oldstories: and he was not without agitation. It was not in his calmnessthat she read his comparative difference. He was not calm; his spiritswere evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively ashe was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but whatdecided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of anhour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury. "He had seen agroup of old acquaintance in the street as he passed&mdash; he had notstopped, he would not stop for more than a word&mdash;but he had the vanityto think they would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as hewished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off." She had nodoubt as to his being less in love&mdash;but neither his agitated spirits,nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was ratherinclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and adiscreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.</p><p>This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of tendays. He was often hoping, intending to come&mdash;but was always prevented.His aunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own accountat Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, itwas to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been ofno service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she wasreally ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it,at Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when helooked back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had beenhalf a year ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing thatcare and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not havemany years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on,by all his father's doubts, to say that her complaints were merelyimaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.</p><p>It soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She couldnot endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation andsuffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to Randallscommunicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately toRichmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill ofan eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. Aready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefitexpected from the change.</p><p>Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of thisarrangement, and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of havingtwo months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends&mdash;for the house was taken for May and June. She was told that now hewrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost asoften as he could even wish.</p><p>Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He wasconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. Shehoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.</p><p>Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted.It was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would bereally having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to ayoung man?&mdash;An hour's ride. He would be always coming over. Thedifference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to makethe whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteenmiles&mdash;nay, eighteen&mdash;it must be full eighteen toManchester-street&mdash;was a serious obstacle. Were he ever able to getaway, the day would be spent in coming and returning. There was nocomfort in having him in London; he might as well be at Enscombe; butRichmond was the very distance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!</p><p>One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by thisremoval,&mdash; the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, butit had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, andvery soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few linesfrom Frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for thechange, and that he had no doubt of being able to join them fortwenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early aday as possible.</p><p>Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.</p><p>Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil tohim. May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates wasengaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and hesanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little Johnwould have any thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.</p></body>
