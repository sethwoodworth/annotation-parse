<H2> Volume 2, Chapter Six</H2><p>The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came withMrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially.He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse theirwalk, immediately fixed on Highbury.&mdash;"He did not doubt there beingvery pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he shouldalways chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-lookingHighbury, would be his constant attraction."&mdash; Highbury, with Mrs.Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the sameconstruction with him. They walked thither directly.</p><p>Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in forhalf a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knewnothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm inarm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him incompany with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of himwas to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amendsfor it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. Itwas not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paidhis duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his wholemanner to her&mdash;nothing could more agreeably denote his wish ofconsidering her as a friend and securing her affection. And there wastime enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visitincluded all the rest of the morning. They were all three walking abouttogether for an hour or two&mdash; first round the shrubberies of Hartfield,and afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admiredHartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their goingfarther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted withthe whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest muchoftener than Emma could have supposed.</p><p>Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. Hebegged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, andwhich had been the home of his father's father; and on recollectingthat an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in questof her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though insome points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, theyshewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which mustbe very like a merit to those he was with.</p><p>Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn,it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarilyabsenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making aparade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly hadnot done him justice.</p><p>Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house,though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair ofpost-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhoodthan from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected tobe detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they gavethe history of the large room visibly added; it had been built manyyears ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in aparticularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used assuch;&mdash;but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now thehighest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whistclub established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.He was immediately interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him;and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the twosuperior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate itscapabilities, and lament that its original purpose should have ceased.He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge none which theysuggested. No, it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. Itwould hold the very number for comfort. They ought to have balls thereat least every fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouserevived the former good old days of the room?&mdash;She who could do anything in Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and theconviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs couldbe tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. Hecould not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he sawaround him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; andeven when particulars were given and families described, he was stillunwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would beany thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in everybody's returning into their proper place the next morning. He arguedlike a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rathersurprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedlyagainst the habits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the lifeand spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father,and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed,there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion ofrank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge,however, of the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion oflively spirits.</p><p>At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; andbeing now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emmarecollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he hadpaid it.</p><p>"Yes, oh! yes"&mdash;he replied; "I was just going to mention it. A verysuccessful visit:&mdash;I saw all the three ladies; and felt very muchobliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had takenme quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, Iwas only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minuteswould have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper;and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him&mdash;butthere was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, Ifound, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, thatI had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of anhour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before."</p><p>"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?"</p><p>"Ill, very ill&mdash;that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to lookill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally sopale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.&mdash; A mostdeplorable want of complexion."</p><p>Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of MissFairfax's complexion. "It was certainly never brilliant, but she wouldnot allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softnessand delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the characterof her face." He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that hehad heard many people say the same&mdash;but yet he must confess, that tohim nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health.Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to themall; and where they were good, the effect was&mdash;fortunately he need notattempt to describe what the effect was.</p><p>"Well," said Emma, "there is no disputing about taste.&mdash;At least you admire her except her complexion."</p><p>He shook his head and laughed.&mdash;"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion."</p><p>"Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?"</p><p>At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastilyexclaimed, "Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attendsevery day of their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highburyhimself, he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business atFord's. If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I mayprove myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury.I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.&mdash; Idare say they sell gloves."</p><p>"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. Youwill be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came,because you were Mr. Weston's son&mdash;but lay out half a guinea at Ford's,and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues."</p><p>They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of "Men'sBeavers" and "York Tan" were bringing down and displaying on thecounter, he said&mdash;"But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you werespeaking to me, you were saying something at the very moment of thisburst of my <i>amor</i> <i>patriae</i>. Do not let me lose it. Iassure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amendsfor the loss of any happiness in private life."</p><p>"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth."</p><p>"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to bea very unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on thedegree of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given heraccount.&mdash; I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she maychuse to allow."</p><p>"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. Buther account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so veryreserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about anybody, that I really think you may say what you like of youracquaintance with her."</p><p>"May I, indeed?&mdash;Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits meso well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells alittle in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,warm-hearted woman. I like them all."</p><p>"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she is destined to be?"</p><p>"Yes&mdash;(rather hesitatingly)&mdash;I believe I do."</p><p>"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma," said Mrs. Weston smiling;"remember that I am here.&mdash;Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to saywhen you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move alittle farther off."</p><p>"I certainly do forget to think of <i>her</i>," said Emma, "as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend."</p><p>He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.</p><p>When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again,"Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?" saidFrank Churchill.</p><p>"Ever hear her!" repeated Emma. "You forget how much she belongs toHighbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.She plays charmingly."</p><p>"You think so, do you?&mdash;I wanted the opinion of some one who couldreally judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, withconsiderable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.&mdash; I amexcessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right ofjudging of any body's performance.&mdash;I have been used to hear her'sadmired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:&mdash;aman, a very musical man, and in love with another woman&mdash;engaged toher&mdash;on the point of marriage&mdash; would yet never ask that other woman tosit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit downinstead&mdash;never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof."</p><p>"Proof indeed!" said Emma, highly amused.&mdash;"Mr. Dixon is verymusical, is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour,from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year."</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof."</p><p>"Certainly&mdash;very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger than, if <i>I</i>had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable to me. I couldnot excuse a man's having more music than love&mdash;more ear than eye&mdash;amore acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings. How did MissCampbell appear to like it?"</p><p>"It was her very particular friend, you know."</p><p>"Poor comfort!" said Emma, laughing. "One would rather have astranger preferred than one's very particular friend&mdash;with a strangerit might not recur again&mdash;but the misery of having a very particularfriend always at hand, to do every thing better than one doesoneself!&mdash; Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle inIreland."</p><p>"You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she really did not seem to feel it."</p><p>"So much the better&mdash;or so much the worse:&mdash;I do not know which. Butbe it sweetness or be it stupidity in her&mdash;quickness of friendship, ordulness of feeling&mdash;there was one person, I think, who must have feltit: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerousdistinction."</p><p>"As to that&mdash;I do not&mdash;"</p><p>"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax'ssensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no humanbeing, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever shewas asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses."</p><p>"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among themall&mdash;" he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, "however,it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were&mdash; how itmight all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there wassmoothness outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from achild, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she islikely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be."</p><p>"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been childrenand women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should beintimate,&mdash;that we should have taken to each other whenever she visitedher friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; alittle, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone totake disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she alwayswas, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, herreserve&mdash;I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved."</p><p>"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed," said he. "Oftentimes veryconvenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person."</p><p>"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then theattraction may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend,or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble ofconquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between MissFairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to thinkill of her&mdash;not the least&mdash;except that such extreme and perpetualcautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct ideaabout any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being somethingto conceal."</p><p>He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long,and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted withhim, that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the worldin some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, thereforebetter than she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate&mdash; hisfeelings warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner ofconsidering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he wouldgo and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. No,he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was tobe pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved,he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. Theremust be ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be ablockhead who wanted more.</p><p>Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talkingabout. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinkinghow many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, hecould be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a smallone. But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he <i>did</i> knowwhat he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiableinclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasionedby no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he didperfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and thatwhenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth tobe allowed an early establishment.</p></body>
